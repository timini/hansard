<p id="S5LV0005P0-00178"><member>THE KING</member>, being seated on the Throne, and the Commons being at the Bar with their SPEAKER, His Majesty was pleased to make a most gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament, and then retired.</p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00183">"I am sending My son, the Prince of Wales, to make an extended journey through My South African possessions in the autumn, before opening, in My name, the first Session of the new Legislature at Cape Town.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00184">"It is with peculiar interest and pleasure that I contemplate this visit, when My son will have the privilege, not for the first time, of inaugurating the Parliamentary life of a great united Dominion, and will convey to South Africa, on behalf of Myself and the Empire, our ardent prayers for the welfare and future progress of her people.</p>

<title>ADDRESS IN REPLY TO HIS<lb/> MAJESTY'S MOST GRACIOUS<lb/> SPEECH.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00202"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FARRER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to move that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty in reply to the gracious Speech from the Throne I am sensible that the kind indulgence which this House invariably extends to those who are entrusted with this most responsible duty is more than ever necessary at the present juncture in public affairs. A condition exists to-day which has been described by the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, once leader of this House, as more serious than any within living memory. That veteran statesman Lord Wemyss&#x2014;I do not think he is here to-night, but I am sure we all rejoice that he is still among us&#x2014;recently told us in a letter to the public Press that he had had an experience of forty-two years in one House and of twenty-seven years in the other. But even he does not carry his memory back to the period of 1832, the only period of modern English history which I think can be in any way compared to the present.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0029"/>
<col>7</col>
I assure your Lordships that, in the quaint, charming, and almost biblical language of our Standing Order No. XXVIII, so far as I am concerned "all personal, sharp, or taxing speech shall be forborn," and I hope also that "as nothing offensive is to be spoken, so nothing will be ill-taken." For no reasoning man who cares for the welfare of his country can help feeling that pure Party strife will have to be banished if the deliberations which must form the chief subject of debate this session are to result in permanent good to our country.<lb/>
The first paragraph of the gracious Speech informs us that the relations with all foreign Powers continue to be friendly. Those who have lived through the storm and stress of the last ten or fifteen years, to whatever Party they belong, will not, I think, minimise the importance of these words, or fail to subscribe to the sentiment of thankfulness that the greatest of British interests&#x2014;the peace of the world&#x2014;remains unbroken. With regard to the affairs of South Africa, so many of your Lordships have had a sad experience of that part of the world that they will not fail to be thankful for the assurance that the date of the Union is now fixed, that the first United Parliament representing the consolidated electorate is about to assemble, and that this Parliament&#x2014;the fruit of concession and goodwill following a period of lamentable strife&#x2014;is to be opened under the happy auspices of the visit of the Prince of Wales. No one in this Assembly will fail to re-echo the sentiments of the gracious Speech that the welfare and future progress of that great people may be assisted by the consideration of His Majesty in sending his son to inaugurate this happy and bloodless ceremony. In our late debates we heard more than once of&#x2014;
<quote>Freedom broadening slowly down from precedent to precedent."</quote>
Those who recollect the splendid poem from which those oft-quoted lines are taken may also recollect the previous stanza&#x2014;
<quote>"It is the land that freemen till</quote>
<quote>That sober-seated Freedom chose,</quote>
<quote>The land where girt by friends or foes</quote>
<quote>A man may speak the thing he will."</quote>
It is, I believe, the devout hope of all of us that that noble ideal of a country pictured by Lord Tennyson may follow the Prince's visit to South Africa, as it has followed his "precedent" in Australia, where the United Parliament was opened by His Royal Highness in 1901.<lb/>
<col>8</col>
Turning to the great Empire of India, which, though perhaps in recent years it has not loomed quite so much in the public eye as His Majesty's South African possessions, yet contains nearly 295 millions of His Majesty's subjects, we are told that the Legislative Councils have entered with good promise upon the enlarged duties and responsibilities entrusted to them. The recent debates in your Lordships' House on this subject were serious, prolonged, and deeply interesting. I believe that all who listened to them felt a certain awe at the vast interests involved and the huge problems opened by those debates. The whole questions of Western and Eastern civilization, of the gradual assimilation of the ideas of each by the other, and the proper limits of autocratic government were debated in this House, at great length, and I think we may congratulate ourselves that they were debated without Party passion, and the result was practically arrived at by consent. It must, therefore, be a satisfaction to all to hear that the results have promise of success, and of adding fresh lustre to the work of those who, I think, are often too little considered&#x2014;that vast Civil Service of India, who patiently spend their lives for their country's interests, without open show or reward, and are content with Henry Lawrence's celebrated epitaph that they have "striven to do their duty."<lb/>
From the survey of the distant parts of the world, the world which the weary Titan bears upon his shoulders, the gracious Speech turns to domestic matters, which have, perhaps, absorbed in recent months a greater, though I do not say a disproportionate, share of public attention. We are told that with the utmost desire for economy a substantial increase has been found necessary in the Navy Estimates. Those who sit on this side of the House are sometimes accused&#x2014;not, of course, in this House, but outside in the country&#x2014;of undue parsimony in matters of this kind; but insurance, as everybody who has to do with finance knows, is one of the most difficult and complicated problems that can be conceived. Only those who know the risks can fully settle what premium they are willing to pay; and having said this it must, of course, also be true that the premium to be paid must depend on the length of the purse. There is one point in connection with this that we cannot too often consider&#x2014;namely, that defence is not the only expenditure which is increasing very rapidly.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0030"/>
<col>9</col>
Even in our own marvellously wealthy country your Lordships have often been reminded by Leaders of the House on both sides&#x2014;I remember two cases at any rate: Lord Salisbury and Lord Rosebery&#x2014;as well as by all those who have held high administrative positions in the financial affairs of this country, that the purse of no nation is unlimited, and I sometimes think of the Latin maxim we were taught at school: <i>Magnum est vectigal parsimonia</i>.<lb/>
I recollect very well that in the first debate in which I had the honour of taking part in your Lordships' House, the late Lord Salisbury pointed out that if a nation doubled its national expenditure in twenty years and trebled its local expenditure in the same time it could not possibly go on for ever in that <i>ratio</i> without serious trouble and disaster; and so many of your Lordships take great part in the local affairs of this country that they must well know how serious is the local burden. No system of taxation, I believe, can be found that can ultimately meet this vast expenditure. I sometimes have listened to diatribes on this subject in other places, but I do not believe the matter has been better expressed than in the immortal words of Mr. Micawber in "David Copperfield"&#x2014;
<quote>"My other piece of advice, Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, ' you know. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six; result, happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six; result, misery. The blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered, the God of Day goes down upon the dreary scene, and&#x2014;in short, you are for ever floored.'"</quote>
My Lords, I now approach the final paragraph of the gracious Speech, which, perhaps, in some ways may be likened to a postscript of a lady's letter as containing the matter most interesting to all of us at the present time. It is, of course, impossible to pretend that "differences of strong opinion" have not arisen and are not arising on this question. But I think we shall all agree that this is not the moment to accentuate those differences. It will, I hope, be agreed that the statement made in the gracious Speech is a clear and unequivocal expression which will afford your Lordships with all convenient speed the opportunity of discussing at full length this grave question. As I have said before, the tremendous nature of this crisis in our history is, I am sure, fully appreciated by everyone in this House. Nor do I for one desire to question the good faith of any of
<col>10</col>
the methods by which this matter has been raised. A good many wild and whirling words have been heard outside, but the very fact of the variety of opinion expressed by members of your Lordships' House is proof, I think, that change is in the air, that it is hardly resisted in principle, and in some quite unexpected quarters is recognised almost as desirable. I will give a few instances.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who presides over the Committees of this House, in a letter to the public Press the other day talked of the need of a breath of fresh air, following, I suppose, the advice of his late leader, Lord Beaconsfield, who began a speech with the words, <i>Sanitas, sanitas omnia sanitas</i>. In thinking over Lord Onslow's letter I happened to recollect that the windows of your Lordships' House, in which the noble Earl spends so many hours, actually open to the outer air. There is, therefore, nothing betwixt the wind and our nobility; while in the adjoining Chamber the fresh air is, I understand, admitted through medicated cotton wool, and even so the influenza germ, which <i>&#x0153;quo pede pulsat pauperum tabernas, regumque turres</i>, rages there with a virulence quite unknown here. Then, again, I see that several of your Lordships belong to, or at any rate attend the dinners of, that grand-sounding body, the British Constitutional Association. At a dinner given in honour of Mr. Harold Cox&#x2014;alas, I was going to say, no longer M.P.&#x2014;it was suggested by one of your Lordships that those who sit on Party Benches have to "pool their consciences," and that a series of items&#x2014;each, I suppose, on his own pillar like St. Simeon Stylites&#x2014;is the ideal form of government.<lb/>
Then there is, of course, the scheme of Lord Rosebery's Committee, in which so many of your Lordships on the opposite Benches took part; there was the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Newton, whose speeches, if I may say so, often delight the House with their wit and humour; and there are the more serious mathematical propositions of my noble friends Lord Courtney and Lord Avebury. I only mention these facts to show the number of persons on both sides of the House who have proposed schemes of reform. I have tried to digest all these, and I even turned up the Abb&#x00E9; Sieyes, that constitution maker in general. I battened upon Stubbs, Hallam, Tod, and Erskine May, but they are severe
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0031"/>
<col>11</col>
reading, and much to my joy I found a reference in the pages of the last named to that prince of writers and Tories, Sir Walter Scott. Indeed, it was to one of his best novels, "Rob Roy," that I was referred for his views on the ancient Scottish Constitution. I was glad to find that "Rob Roy" was referred to. Of one of the greatest American Ambassadors to this country, Mr. James Russell Lowell, this story is told: Oliver Wendell Holmes was supposed to be dying. Lowell went to see him and said, "How are you to-day, Oliver?" to which Holmes answered, "I don't know and I don't care, James; I am in the middle of 'Rob Roy.'" Well, in the middle of "Rob Roy" Andrew Fairservice, the typical Scots gardener, gives his opinion of the efficient Parliament, and with the permission of the House I will read his views on compromise as carried on in the British Parliament&#x2014;
<quote>"And this is what they ca' explaining&#x2014;the tane gies up a bit, and the tither gies up a bit, and a' friends again. Aweel, after the Commons' Parliament had tuggit, and rived, and ruggit at Morris and his rubbery till they were tired o't, the Lords' Parliament they behoved to hae their spell o't. In puir auld Scotland's Parliament they a' sate thegither, cheek for choul, and than they did na need to hae the same blethers twice ower again. But till't their lordships gaed wi' as muckle teeth and gude will, as if the matter had been a' speck and span new."</quote>
On looking up the history of this I found, much to my surprise, that in the old Scots Parliament they did all sit cheek by jowl. Do not let me for a moment be supposed to suggest that Andrew's solution is the right one, but I believe it to be historically true.<lb/>
I hope I have shown what great varieties of opinion as to remedies there are even among your Lordships' own members; but I venture to hope that it is common ground that we should approach this question with all sincerity and sobriety of thought, and, above all, in an historical and not a polemical spirit. The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, once suggested that when passions were greatly excited the study of astronomy formed the best possible sedative, because it inevitably made the observer feel what a small insignificant speck he formed in the vast unexplored masses of the universe. So with our deliberations to-day. We are only one of the twenty generations which have existed since Parliaments were formed, and I hope that we may not be one whit
<col>12</col>
less competent than our ancestors to deal with these questions when they arise. It has been said, I think by the historian Green, that Englishmen are so much occupied in making history that they seldom read it. There never was a time when it was more necessary to read history than to-day. We have behind us in this Mother of Parliaments 700 years of splendid traditions from the date when the Great Charter of 1216 put into definite writing those financial conventions which had been growing up as customs. In the words of the historian&#x2014;
<quote>"The vague expressions of the older charters were now exchanged for precise and elaborate provisions. The bonds of unwritten custom, which the older grants did little more than recognise, had proved too weak, and the Baronage now threw them aside for the restraints of written law."</quote>
Human nature, especially English human nature, does not change very materially with the centuries, and we have hitherto found out methods of compromise to suit altering circumstances&#x2014;not, I am proud to think, slavish copies of other nations, but original, living, and satisfactory working methods. It is, I believe, the desire of every Member of this House, without exception, that such methods may again be found, even if the Act involves compromise, and even though many of us may in the abstract prefer custom or common law to rules and Statutes. It is with the earnest and confident hope that such a way may be found that I beg to move that the following humble Address be presented to His Majesty:&#x2014;"Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00203"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to avail myself of the great honour given me of seconding the Address in reply to His Majesty's gracious Speech from the Throne, I cannot claim from your Lordships the indulgence you invariably give to those in my position under the First Offenders Act, for, although my offences have been but little ones, I have on one or two occasions trespassed for a few moments on your Lordships' time. Neither do I dare to ask for special indulgence, because I have been engaged recently in the country
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0032"/>
<col>13</col>
strongly deprecating your Lordships' action in this House in a matter of common knowledge to all of us. But I shall plead with your Lordships on the ground of the record of my family&#x2014;a record, save for my small offences, of silence for nigh on a hundred years; and this should guarantee your Lordships to some extent against a lengthy outburst of verbosity on my part on this occasion.<lb/>
The satisfaction which His gracious Majesty must feel at our continued friendliness with all foreign Powers is doubtless shared with all respect by his loyal subjects throughout the Empire; and if the visit of any royal personage to our shores is an emblem of our friendship with the country from which he hails, then, in the words of the classic, we may say with fervour <i>Ut veniunt omnes</i>, which, I believe, liberally translated is "Let 'em all come."<lb/>
My Lords, I turn to the paragraph in the gracious Speech relating to South Africa. However we may differ in politics, however sharply the line may be drawn between this and the other side of the House in many matters, here at any rate we are on common ground, rejoicing with common patriotism at the ending of strife and turmoil in South Africa. When I first put this uniform on [the noble Lord wore the uniform of a Colonel in the Royal Scots Fusiliers] it was on January 22, 1879, the day of the Isandlwana massacre of the 24th Regiment by the Zulus. A few weeks after that I landed at Durban, and for the greater part of the next two years was quartered in the Transvaal. I only trouble your Lordships with this personal reminiscence in order to emphasise how clearly I recollect, not only the deep-seated illwill of the Boer for the Briton, but also, to my regret, the like feeling in no way diluted of the Briton for the Boer. My Lords, on the mess table of my old regiment there lies at this moment a Union Jack enclosed in a casket. This flag flew over Pretoria during the siege of 1881. It was buried at the close of the siege to prevent its falling into the hands of the Boers, and it was subsequently dug up and brought to England by the regiment. Can any one doubt&#x2014;indeed, does not every one know&#x2014;that if that same flag was taken back to South Africa and hoisted in the same place on the same pole in Pretoria it would be reverenced to-day by Briton and Boer alike. And in the Speech from the Throne
<col>14</col>
the crowning point of this glorious history is foretold. It will be in the recollection of your Lordships that in the year 1900 His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales&#x2014;at that time Duke of York&#x2014;was designated by our late beloved Queen to open the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, and that, in spite of the grievous event which afflicted our Royal House on January 22 of the following year, that expressed wish, by the command of His Majesty, was carried into effect on May 8. And now, my Lords, at the bidding again of his Royal Father, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is about to give further personal service to his King and country by opening, in the name of His Majesty, the first session of the new Legislature of South Africa.<lb/>
The paragraph in the Speech relating to India will be noted with great interest by those of your Lordships who were present at the debate last year. Not only will the speech of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India be in vivid remembrance, but also the speeches of other noble Lords who, if they expressed gloomy forebodings, at least impressed us not only by their transparent sincerity but also by their devotion to the country which, in responsible positions, they had served with so much benefit to India and such credit to themselves&#x2014;and if those gloomy forebodings prove, as the gracious Speech would happily seem to suggest, to be unfounded no one will more gladly hail them false prophets than the noble Lords themselves.<lb/>
The next paragraph, my Lords, will be read with the deepest satisfaction by all classes throughout the length and breadth of this great Empire. While showing an earnest watchfulness over the resources of the nation, it recognises, in the cause of peace, the paramount necessity of a strong Navy. Whatever Government is in office those sentiments will always prevail, and Britain will never lack men to carry them into effect; and if one great man has just left the Admiralty Board whose work has been thorough and unflinching, another has succeeded him in whom the Navy has, and the country will shortly have, the greatest confidence. I pass over the next paragraph with simply an expression of deep admiration for the Treasury officials, who were left late last year in rather the position of a schoolboy whose promised
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0033"/>
<col>15</col>
parental allowance has been lost in the post, who has got home for the holidays, no one quite knows how, and is awaiting the coming term with a light heart.<lb/>
With a sigh of relief, in which your Lordships will doubtless join me, I turn to the last paragraph of the gracious Speech, and on this I would say but a few words and those with the deepest respect. I allude, of course, to the recent action of your Lordships' House and the outcome of that action. Patriotism finds its home in no particular Party; the desire to do that which is best for our country prevails in all our hearts. Here, then, again, is common ground between us. If we during the past four years have experienced feelings nigh akin to despair at the fate of many of our measures, you who differ from us must often have felt heavily oppressed by the weight of your vast but unrepresentative majority. With all respect, I liken noble Lords opposite to the trustee of a trust with a very wide investment clause, which carries with it deep and heavy responsibilities; and we on this side of the House are like a trustee with a very narrow clause, which scarcely allows us to get for our trust a beggarly three per cent. Surely we should all welcome relief from this manifestly unfair state of things, and if a Bill can be framed through which and by which a Second Chamber will come into existence which will faithfully interpret the will of the nation&#x2014;which I humbly submit your Lordships' House as at present constituted does not do&#x2014;then surely patriotism will prevail over party. Parliament will be secured against sudden and unnecessary upheaval, and a two-Chamber Government will be in vogue be the majority in another place Liberal or Conservative.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00205"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the two noble Lords to whom we have just listened will, I have no doubt, hardly expect that we shall entirely concur with the whole of the observations which have fallen from them. But, nevertheless, we may, I trust, be permitted to congratulate them upon the manner in which they have discharged a not very easy task; and if I may go a little further I would single out for admiration the sobriety and
<col>16</col>
moderation of the language in which they referred to some of the extremely controversial topics dealt with in the gracious Speech from the Throne&#x2014;language which forms an agreeable contrast to other utterances which have occupied public attention during the last few weeks. Whatever may be the future destiny of this House, we may be permitted to express the hope that the two noble Lords opposite will have many opportunities of taking a useful part in our deliberations.<lb/>
We shall certainly concur, and concur unreservedly, in what they said with regard to the first paragraph of the gracious Speech&#x2014;that in which we are informed that His Majesty's relations with all foreign Powers continue to be of a friendly description&#x2014;and we shall concur not less cordially in their observations upon the second and third paragraphs which deal with the intention of His Majesty to allow His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to visit South Africa for the purpose of opening the new Parliament which will shortly assemble there. His Royal Highness will add yet another to the many services which members of the Royal Family have rendered to the Empire upon occasions of this kind. We trust that his visit will be interesting and instructive to him, and I think we may say without hesitation that His Majesty could not have chosen a more gracious or appropriate mode of signifying to his South African subjects his personal good will towards them and the sympathy which we feel with these great and rising communities. I noticed a few days ago a very interesting statement that an effort was being made in South Africa to inaugurate the new Parliament by combining in one Government a number of the foremost public men of the country without reference to Party. I gather that a sufficient amount of opposition has developed itself to this proposal to make it impossible of adoption. The matter clearly is one which only those upon the spot who are familiar with the local conditions have a right to comment upon. All that I think we can say upon the subject is that we should have rejoiced if it had proved practicable for the statesmen of South Africa to follow on this occasion the precedent set in similar epochs in the history of Canada and Australia; and if the attempt has, as I am afraid we must believe, not succeeded, it seems to me none the less creditable to those
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0034"/>
<col>17</col>
concerned in making it. May I interject the remark that the new South African Parliament will include a Senate which will be empowered, among other things, to reject money Bills?<lb/>
The next paragraph in the Speech has reference to another question of local self-government in another part of His Majesty's Dominions&#x2014;I refer to His Majesty's statement as to the first assemblage of the new Indian Legislative Councils. The noble Lord who seconded referred to the deflates which took place in this House when the Indian Councils Bill came up for consideration, and he said with great truth that there were some of us who then regarded with a certain amount of misgiving the proposal to give to India institutions following so far and so fully the Parliamentary model as we understand it in Western countries. We should have been culpable, having those feelings, if we had not expressed them, but the noble Lord is quite right when he says that no members of your Lordships' House will more cordially rejoice than we who offered those criticisms if it should prove to be the case that our misgivings were unfounded, and therefore we welcome the announcement that these new councils have entered with good promise upon their enlarged duties. I trust the noble Viscount opposite will not think me needlessly critical if I express slight astonishment that he should not have advised His Majesty to add to this part of the Speech some reassuring words, if they could be spoken, upon the general condition of affairs in India.<lb/>
Many of us regard those affairs with very grave apprehensions. Public opinion has been shocked by a series of outrages directed against persons of all classes and stations from the Viceroy downwards. We cannot regard these occurrences as merely accidental outbursts of fanaticism; and, indeed, that evidently is not the manner in which they are regarded by the Government of India. In a speech delivered by the Viceroy on the occasion of the first meeting of the Legislative Council at Calcutta Lord Minto said:&#x2014;
<quote>"The progress of the work on which we have been engaged has been marred by a succession of abominable crimes which have forced my Government into one repressive measure after another; and yesterday, on the eve of the assembly of this Council, a faithful and gallant public servant was brutally murdered within the precincts of the
<col>18</col>
High Court and in the broad light of day. A spirit hitherto unknown to India has come into existence&#x2014;a spirit opposed to all the teachings of Indian religion and traditions, a spirit of anarchy and lawlessness which seeks to subvert not only British rule, but the government of Indian chiefs, to whom I am deeply indebted for their loyal assistance."</quote>
My Lords, those are very grave and very disquieting words. I think we may regard them as affording ample justification for those repressive measures to which Lord Minto refers, and in particular for the recently introduced measure for restraining the licence of the Indian Press&#x2014;a measure which I venture to say has not been resorted to an hour too soon. There can be no doubt as to the part which the Indian Press has played in the propagation of these anarchical and seditious doctrines; there can be no doubt as to the entire inadequacy of the law as it stood to deal with such offences; and I think I may also say that there can be no doubt that the proposals of the Indian Council do not err upon the side of severity. One word more about India. I think public opinion here has been a good deal puzzled by the announcement, made simultaneously, I think, with the introduction of the Press Bill, that a certain number of persons who had been deported on account of their connection with seditious movements were to be set at liberty. I feel that these are matters which we are not in a position to judge from a distance, and therefore I for one am ready to wait for the explanations which I have no doubt will be forthcoming and to assume that the Government of India had good reason for taking a step which, at first sight, is somewhat difficult to explain.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I pass to the subsequent paragraphs of the Speech. We learn in the first place that the financial measures which have become necessary are to have priority over all other business that will come before Parliament. That is an interesting statement, and I may be permitted to say that His Majesty's Government appear to have adopted the only course which, as businesslike men, they could have adopted, and that I tender them my respectful admiration for the manner in which they have disregarded counsels of a very different kind which they have freely received from many of their followers and supporters. Parliament is to be asked to complete the provision which was made in the last, session for
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0035"/>
<col>19</col>
the year which is about to expire; in other words, to overtake the arrears which have grown up inevitably in consequence of the rejection of the Finance Bill of last year by your Lordships' House, and I notice with some satisfaction the moderate language in which this question is referred to in the gracious Speech, and in which it was referred to by noble Lords opposite. Your Lordships will remember the prophecies which were indulged in by colleagues of the noble Earl opposite with regard to the consequences which were to follow from our postponement of the Finance Bill. There was to be chaos, inextricable chaos; there was to be a hideous loss to the taxpayers&#x2014;a loss which could be expressed only in millions of pounds sterling. I am delighted to find that all these vaticinations appear to have been unfounded. With regard to the fact that there are arrears to be overtaken, may I be permitted to make one or two observations? In the first place, do not let it be forgotten that even if your Lordships had passed the Finance Bill in December last, the finances of the year 1909&#x2013;10 were already many months&#x2014;I should say probably five months at least&#x2014;in arrear. So that our action has resulted only in the addition of a few weeks more to an already existing arrear. That is one thing to be borne in mind. In the next place, I greatly doubt whether any arrear has been occasioned which cannot be overtaken by the efforts of those indefatigable officials who are entrusted with the management of our financial affairs. In the third place, I suggest that if any inconvenience has arisen to the public, it might have been very much mitigated and diminished if His Majesty's Government had thought fit to avail themselves of the offer we made to them, the offer, I mean, to facilitate by special legislation the collection of any of the non-contentious taxes which were necessary in order to prevent the accumulation of a deficit. You were in no mood to accept that offer when we made it, and the arrear and inconvenience have no doubt been proportionately augmented. Of the Finance Bill of 1909 all that I will say is that our opinion of it remains unchanged. We remain convinced that in principle it is open to the criticisms which we offered during the long discussions last year. We are also convinced that it is open to the further criticism that you have fixed your taxation at many points so high that the revenue is becoming inelastic and is ceasing
<col>20</col>
to respond to the extra demands you are making on those who have to pay. But, my Lords, if the Finance Bill finds favour with the new House of Commons and comes back to this House, I apprehend that we shall have no more to say, and will not only be ready to pass it into law but that we shall quite understand that you should desire to expedite its passage by all legitimate means which may be open to you.<lb/>
But, my Lords, there are other matters in regard to which, I think, you may find this House not quite so accommodating. I venture to mention one to which no reference is made in the Speech from the Throne, but which, nevertheless, arises out of the proposals embodied in that Speech. I mean the question of Home Rule for Ireland. Home Rule for Ireland was given a good deal of prominence during the electoral campaign, but it was rather a fitful prominence. It was ostentatiously obtruded on the public in the Albert Hall speech, no doubt, from the point of noble Lords opposite, with very excellent results, for we all know that a large number of elections were won by the Irish vote, influenced by the prospects that were then held out. After that the matter was allowed judiciously to drop somewhat into the background. During the last few days, however, His Majesty's Government must have been painfully reminded of the existence of the difficulty by the storm of ultimatums which apparently have been flying about the purlieus of Downing Street. But one thing I venture to say is clear, and that is that Home Rule forms an essential feature in the policy which His Majesty's Government is going to ask Parliament to adopt. It is the veto of the House of Lords that has stood in the way of Home Rule, and the veto of the House of Lords is to go, amongst other reasons, in order that the way may be clear for Home Rule. So the sequence is clear and distinct; first, finance; then, what I would call, for want of a better word, the sterilisation of the House of Lords; then Home Rule for Ireland.<lb/>
I venture to express my amazement at the audacity of a Government which assumes the right to make such proposals to Parliament upon the strength of the elections which have lately taken place. What have you got to show as the result of those elections? You have a not very
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0036"/>
<col>21</col>
emphatic pronouncement&#x2014;if, indeed, it be a pronouncement at all&#x2014;in favour of the imposition of certain taxes, and this pronouncement has been accompanied by the virtual disappearance of the whole of your official majority. Compare for a moment your Parliamentary position as it stood, last autumn and as it stands now. You then disposed of legions strong enough to trample under foot not only your official opponents, but your own irregulars, who had to be reckoned with at times. You have now&#x2014;your Whips proclaim it&#x2014;the two great Parties evenly balanced, and in order to establish a majority at all you have to invoke the aid of allies whom you do not admit to your council table, who ostentatiously proclaim their detachment from you, who dictate terms to you in the most peremptory language, and who, if they follow you at all, do so because they think that by doing so they can achieve ulterior aims which are not in all cases the aims you desire to attain. Do you think this a sufficient mandate to justify you in pulling the Constitution of this country to pieces, in breaking up the Union, and in setting up single Chamber government? I use that last expression advisedly, because I say that if the words contained in the latter part of His Majesty's Speech have any meaning at all, that is what they mean. It is a sentence of death upon the House of Lords. To complete the solemnity of the occasion, the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack might have produced the black cap when he read the fatal words.<lb/>
What is the crime for which this House is sentenced? We find some description of it in the words of the Speech:&#x2014;
<quote>"There have been differences of strong opinion between the two Houses, and serious difficulties have arisen."</quote>
What does that mean? Does it not mean simply this&#x2014;that your Lordships have had opinions of your own and have had the courage to adhere to them? All that is to be at an end. We may have any opinions we please, but they are not to avail. Two things are to happen. This House is to be subject to the House of Commons in regard to all ordinary legislation. That is founded upon the old charge made so constantly against this House that it obstructs the legislation introduced by Liberal Governments. I am not going to enter into that at length to-night, but
<col>22</col>
I will say this: that we have met that charge again and again in this House and out of this House, and we are ready to meet it whenever it is repeated. We have been able to show that if we have rejected Bills, they have in some cases been Bills which you did not dare to refer to the people of this country. We have shown that in other cases, as in the case of the Home Rule Bill, the people of this country approved and vindicated the course which we took. We have shown that yet in other cases, when you have attempted to legislate on subjects with which this House has dealt, your second proposals and your third proposals differed totally from your original proposals. We have shown&#x2014;and to my mind it is a very convincing piece of evidence&#x2014;that Liberal Ministers have constantly boasted of their wonderful achievements in the way of legislation for bettering the lot of the people of this country, and we have shown how entirely inconsistent language of that kind is with the theory that the House of Lords is always there to obstruct your legislative proposals.<lb/>
The other limb of the Government policy is one by which this House is to be deprived of all right of dealing with finance. Why? Are we habitual criminals in dealing with finance? The whole point of the charge against us in the month of December last was that we were doing something when we rejected the Finance Bill which we had never done before. It was a single occurrence, one act of interference, one solitary decision not to take the responsibility of passing a measure which His Majesty's Government themselves described as an extraordinary measure, without obtaining an expression of the views of the people of this country upon it. And, after all, is the noble Earl quite sure that We are going to be convicted of that offence? If public form counts for anything, the present House of Commons contains a majority of members opposed to the Finance Bill of last year. But we know the arts which can be used for the purpose of disarming hostility of that kind, and you may get your Bill. If you get your Bill in the House of Commons, you will get it here, and you will be very lucky to get it. But do you mean to tell me that a victory of that kind is a victory which will justify you in overturning the Constitution of this country? When you have won it, ought you not to consider a little the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0037"/>
<col>23</col>
means by which you have won it? Ought you not to consider a little the not very creditable figure which you have been cutting during the last few days while these negotiations with your so-called supporters have been in progress? And then ought you not to ask yourselves whether on the strength of a victory so obtained you have the right so to manipulate the Constitution of this country that the people who have pronounced a not very decisive verdict upon this occasion will never have a future opportunity of pronouncing any verdict at all?<lb/>
If your Lordships will bear with me for a moment, I should like to say two or three words in regard to the plan of House of Lords reform which is indicated in the gracious Speech. Its language is at some points a little oracular. In the first place the House of Commons is to have undivided authority over finance. I hope the noble Earl when he follows me will be able to give us some idea of what he means when he talks of finance. Finance may mean a good many different things. It may mean Supply, Ways and Means, the provisions that used to be included in the Customs and Inland Revenue Bill, but it may also mean any measure dealing with ordinary legislation in which there lurks some fragment or <i>soup&#x00E7;on</i> of finance. Which is it that you mean? We have had some experience in this House&#x2014;a rather painful experience&#x2014;of the manner in which the present privilege of the House of Commons in regard to finance is interpreted. Is the intention of His Majesty's Government this, that supposing we had, for example, a measure of social legislation of first-rate importance, involving, as all such measures must, the expenditure of public money&#x2014;money of the ratepayers or taxpayers&#x2014;is it your intention that the House of Lords is to be warned off such measures, and is not to have any right to deal with them in an effectual manner at all? That is a plain question, and, by the way, it is a question which you will be obliged to face, because we understand that these proposals are to be embodied in a Bill. It is to be a Bill defining the relations of the two Houses. In your Bill you will have to let it appear plainly and distinctly what it is that you intend when you talk of "undivided authority over finance." I go further. I am not at all sure that it will not be necessary for you to set up some kind of
<col>24</col>
authority which will be able to decide whether a particular measure or a particular provision in a measure is or is not a measure of finance. It would be of no use to let each House interpret your Rule in its own fashion, and it would be an outrage to allow one House to have the interpretation of it, and to impose that interpretation upon the other House.<lb/>
The other proposal, that the House of Commons should be given predominance in legislation, is perhaps less ambiguous, because we gather from the words that follow that all that is to be left to the House of Lords is the power of initiation, of revision, and, subject to proper safeguards, of delay. I do not know whether your Lordships will be very grateful for permission to initiate measures which the other House may put calmly into the wastepaper basket. I do not know whether you will care very much about exercising functions of revision which may be wholly ineffectual. As for delay, I presume that means that we are to have a revival of the plan proposed by the late Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman&#x2014;a plan which after all only came to this, that any Bill which the House of Commons chose to read nine times would automatically be imposed "willy-nilly" upon the House of Lords. I hope we may have some information upon these points.<lb/>
But I find other words of a most suggestive character in this paragraph. We are told that "this House"&#x2014;which I understand to be the House in which we are sitting&#x2014;[A Voice: "No"]&#x2014;there seems to be a doubt; perhaps the noble Earl will give us a ruling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00206"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is the House in which His Majesty made his speech.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00207"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Exactly; that was my interpretation. This House, then, is to be so constituted as to exercise these threefold functions with impartiality. Surely that is an entirely new development. A few days ago none of us had any reason whatever for believing that it was intended to deal with the constitution of this House. I paid some attention to the speeches delivered by His Majesty's Ministers during the electoral campaign. There was one exception&#x2014;Sir Edward Grey&#x2014;who made it clear that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0038"/>
<col>25</col>
in his opinion the hereditary principle was out of date and that some form of election was necessary for the establishment of a properly constituted Second Chamber. But that was not the view of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister made several interesting announcements on the subject, but he made one which was particularly categoric and distinct in reply to the inevitable Scottish heckler. The heckler asked him&#x2014;What are you going to do in order to improve the House of Lords? The Prime Minister's reply was distinct&#x2014;
<quote>"We are not going to improve the House of Lords at all. What we are going to do is to deprive the House of Lords of its veto."</quote>
And it is curious that that attitude of the Prime Minister is entirely in accord with a very remarkable statement which he made in the course of the Albert Hall speech. He had been strongly condemning the action of this House, and then he went on to say this&#x2014;
<quote>"It may well be that a process of evolution or substitution may in course of time give us a body better fitted than the House of Lords for the judicial exercise of its functions."</quote>
So that if there was to be any alteration at all in the constitution of the House of Lords, it was clearly contemplated that that should be the result of a gradual process of evolution which would take some time to accomplish. All that is changed. You are now apparently going to introduce this session, perhaps try to pass this session, a Bill dealing not only with the powers but with the constitution of the House of Lords. Is it not evident that second thoughts have occurred to His Majesty's Ministers? Is it not likely that, when they read the extraordinarily violent statements made by some of them with regard to this House and to the absurdity of the hereditary principle, it occurred to them that there was something indescribably ridiculous and grotesque in proposing to solve this great constitutional problem by leaving us with a House of Lords which would be a futile expression of the hereditary principle, <i>et preterea nihil?</i> That really was the proposal which held the field for a time. I have no doubt those second thoughts did occur, perhaps rather late in the day, and that that is the explanation of the fact that this proposal for dealing with the constitution of this House has been pitchforked into the Speech at the last moment.<lb/>
I am not going to ask the noble Earl to
<col>26</col>
reveal to us his intentions or the intentions of his colleagues as to the manner in which the new House of Lords is to be constituted. It obviously would be an improper question to ask, and moreover I feel quite sure he would not be able to answer me if I did ask the question. But I am going to ask him another question which seems to me reasonable. We are informed that the proposals dealing with the House of Lords will be laid before us with "all convenient speed." Now what does "all convenient speed" mean? Whose convenience is going to be consulted? We should like to know. Is it to be the speed of a Parliamentary train or is it to be a mile a minute? Are you going to think of the convenience of the exectuioners or the convenience of the victims? I confess I rather like the sentence, because I cannot help detecting in it an announcement by the Prime Minister&#x2014;a useful announcement&#x2014;to some of his supporters and perhaps to some of his colleagues that he intends, as they say in Scotland, to "gang his am gait." But I will ask the noble Earl a question specifically. Is it the intention of His Majesty's Government that this Bill is to be not only introduced this session but, if possible, passed into law this session? I think that is a pertinent question. I assume that His Majesty's Ministers know their own minds on the subject and are prepared with concrete proposals, but they have got to get finance out of the way first. Then they have to bring in their Bill, and then they have to get their Bill through the House of Commons.<lb/>
Now what I am anxious to know is whether it is in contemplation that we should take this Bill dealing with this. House, as we sometimes take Bills, in the very last days of the session, and whether we shall be expected to proceed with it then. Are we to be invited, if I may so put it, to perform the ceremony known, I believe, in Japan as the "happy despatch" in the inside of a fortnight at the beginning of the month of August? I think the noble Earl will encounter a considerable amount of opposition to any idea of the kind. The noble Earl and his colleagues accused us of being revolutionary because we refused to give our concurrence to the Finance Bill until the people of this country should have had an opportunity of passing judgment upon it. What epithet should we apply to His Majesty's Government if they reply
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0039"/>
<col>27</col>
by attempting to overturn the Constitution and by endeavouring to rush their proposals through Parliament, perhaps with the assistance of extra-constitutional methods which I believe have not been resorted to since the reign of Queen Anne?<lb/>
There is one further observation which I wish to make on this part of the Speech. I earnestly hope that when I indicate these apprehensions as to the proposals of His Majesty's Government they will not regard me, or regard those who sit near me, as desiring in any way to shirk the discussion of this question of House of Lords reform. We admit&#x2014;many of us at any rate admit&#x2014;that there is a House of Lords question. This House contains members who have made that question their own. There is my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery) who has devoted for many years past a special amount of attention to that question. There are other Peers like my two noble friends who sit near me, who took up this question of House of Lords reform even before they were Members of this House. There is my noble friend Lord Newton, who was instrumental in procuring the appointment of the Committee which dealt with the matter and produced an important Report destined to be often referred to hereafter. I will go as far as this. I will say that in my belief there are not many Members of this House who would not approach this question with an open mind tempered, perhaps, by a sense of the extreme gravity of the problem we are discussing. I will, however, take upon myself to say that there are two things which this House does not want. We do not want to have a sham House of Lords, a House of Lords which would be a mere tawdry and ineffectual <i>simulacrum</i> of what a Second Chamber ought to be. Neither do we want to see a brand new Senate set up in the place of this House, a Senate the powers of which would be co-ordinate with those of the House of Commons and would necessarily come into conflict with them.<lb/>
But if you are able to show&#x2014;and you may be able to show&#x2014;that this House is unwieldy in point of numbers, that it is not constituted in such a manner as to conduce to the efficient discharge of business, then I say we are ready to consider whether we cannot do something to render it more efficient. If you can show that there are Members of this House who for various reasons are unable to give
<col>28</col>
a proper attention to the discharge of their Parliamentary duties, we are ready to consider whether means cannot be discovered of relieving them of those duties; and if you can show&#x2014;and I dare say it is possible to show it&#x2014;that under our existing system we are exposed to finding the two Houses involved in a deadlock, I say let us like reasonable people try to discover means by which they can be extricated from such an unfortunate position. In all these matters I believe that you will find many of us on this side ready to co-operate with you if you will accept our co-operation. If you will not accept our co-operation, then I think it will be for us to consider whether at the proper time we should not lay before the public proposals of our own for dealing with these points. But I venture to press this upon your Lordships&#x2014;that for the present His Majesty's Government are seized of this question, and it is for them first to lay on the Table of Parliament their proposals for dealing with it. I trust that my apprehensions and misgivings may prove to be groundless. I trust that we shall find that, if you are going to lay hands on the Constitution of this country, you are going to do it, as the noble seconder said, in a spirit of sobriety and moderation, and that there will be no trace of petulance or of vindictiveness in your treatment of this immense issue. I trust that you will deal with it in a manner consistent with the dignity of both Houses of Parliament, and that you will do nothing to deprive this country of the safeguards which it at present possesses against precipitate and ill-considered legislation by the other House of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

That is an omission for which I do not blame the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00209"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I merely said that I associated myself with what had been said by the two noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00210"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is indeed a happy fact that the state of affairs in Europe and in connection with foreign politics generally should be such that no particular comment is thought to be necessary by noble Lords opposite. But there is one event connected with foreign affairs&#x2014;a very sad event&#x2014;to which I am compelled to allude for a moment. Your Lordships may have noticed that an attack was made on Boutros Pasha, the Prime Minister of Egypt, on the afternoon of yesterday. It was a political crime of the type with which in different parts of the world we are only too familiar; and I deeply regret to say that Boutros Pasha died this morning, and that Egypt has lost in him a hardworking, honourable, and distinguished statesman. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has lost no time in conveying to the Egyptian Government and to the relatives of Boutros Pasha our warm sympathy with the loss, the sense of which must come home to every one who has at heart the welfare of Egypt.
Then the noble Marquess spoke in sympathetic terms of the paragraph in which the approaching visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to South Africa is announced. Those of us who recollect the debate which took place on the Union Bill of last year will remember how uniform in all parts of the House was the sense of gratification felt at that Union, and we all feel that it will be its appropriate crown that the illustrious Prince, accompanied, as I trust he will be, by the gracious presence of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, will be able to undertake once more the task which he carried out so acceptably in inaugurating the Australian Commonwealth. The noble Marquess made one or two observations,
<col>30</col>
framed I need not say with the discretion which is habitual to him, with regard to the future political situation in South Africa. That, as he truly remarked, is a matter for the South Africans themselves. But I am glad to be able to say that as far as my knowledge goes, whether or no the future Government of South Africa takes in any degree the form of what is known as a coalition or not, yet I am convinced that the statesmen of all parties in South Africa are approaching their difficult task in a spirit which argues well that we may be able to hope that at any rate no undue spirit of racialism or extreme party feeling will disfigure the politics of the South African Union.<lb/>
The noble Marquess made a more extended reference to the affairs of India, and he commented on what he considered was an omission from the Speech&#x2014;namely, that we had not placed in the Speech some definite allusion to the condition of the country. The noble Marquess made that fact the text of some observations of high interest. It is perfectly true, lamentably true as the noble Marquess has said, that secret organisations for criminal purposes, which have been the cause of more than one attempted crime and of more than one successful crime, still exist in India; but in spite of that it is the definitely expressed opinion of the Indian Government and of those best qualified to judge, that there are hopeful signs of an increasing sympathy with the Government in India. The Indian Government believe that the better opinion in India is beginning to assert itself; and this is not surprising because we know that it frequently happens in parallel cases that it is not until that more sane and sober opinion which is always perhaps, too little prone to assert itself is aroused by the perpetration of crimes such as these, that it is possible to discover how strong that opinion really is. I trust that this may be the case in India, and undoubtedly it is the opinion of the Indian Government that it is.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess alluded to the Press Law in terms of approbation. The heads of that Act were submitted by the Indian Government to the Secretary of State, and were approved by him. The full text of the Act will in a few days from now reach this country and will be examined by the Secretary of State in Council, and after it may have received any amendment he may consider necessary, will come into
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0041"/>
<col>31</col>
full operation. The essence of the law is that in all eases the proprietors of newspapers will be required, or may be required, to deposit security which will be liable to forfeiture at the discretion of the Executive. If transgressions are repeated the printing presses will be liable to be seized and forfeited as well as the security. There is an appeal provided for in the Act to a special Bench of Judges. It is hoped by the Indian Government and by my noble friend behind me that this law will have the effect of checking a vast amount of the mischief which beyond all contradiction has been caused by the irresponsible Press in India.<lb/>
The noble Marquess spoke, moderately but still somewhat critically, on the act of the Indian Government with reference to the deportations and to the recent release of some of those who had been deported. He quoted from a speech by the Viceroy of India in another connection, but in that same speech, unless I am mistaken, the Viceroy stated for public information the reasons which had induced the Indian Government to come to the conclusion that these remissions might properly be made. I am sure that noble Lords opposite, including two ex-Viceroys, will agree with me that Indian Governments have regarded this power of deportation as strictly an emergency power, only to be used in cases of extreme necessity. Because you cannot deny that the procedure of arresting and detaining men for an indefinite time, without charge and without trial, and without, any intention of putting them on trial, is one which is foreign to our usual procedure. It is certainly the opinion of the Indian Government that in these particular cases deportation at that time produced the effect it was intended to produce&#x2014;a salutary effect. But it would be, I think, hardly fair to say that because Anarchist plots are going on&#x2014;Anarchist plots always having to be distinguished from a general seditious feeling, it must be remembered&#x2014;these men ought to be indefinitely detained until you are certain that these underground currents have altogether ceased to flow. That, I think, would be a hard thing to say and something of a shock to reasonable public opinion. The noble Marquess expressed himself as quite willing to trust the Indian Government in this matter, and I hope we may venture to leave the matter there, and to believe that they
<col>32</col>
have acted in the best interests of order in India in taking the course they did<lb/>
With these observations I leave that part of the Speech which deals with affairs outside this country. The noble Marquess naturally devoted no small part of his remarks to those paragraphs in the Speech which are especially addressed to the House of Commons as dealing with finance. It certainly seems to me, so far as I have been able to judge from such attention as I am able to pay to the public Press that the position of the country with regard to finance has not been entirely appreciated. It does not seem to have been altogether understood that the subject which must have the very first claim on the attention of the Government is not the provision of Ways and Means, but the Services of the year; and for this reason, that you can get on well enough for an indefinite time, although your doing so may produce great inconvenience and much loss&#x2014;you can get on so far as provision of Ways and Means is concerned, for an almost indefinite time, by borrowing; but what you cannot do without definite powers from the House of Commons is to spend any of the money which you borrow or which you raise in any other way. Therefore, the first necessity of this session is the provision of supply for the Public Services.<lb/>
I digress for a moment from the financial question to say a word about the Navy. The Navy, to which I do not think the noble Marquess specifically alluded, was made the subject of a great many speeches in the course of the General Election. I do not propose to say anything here about a particular kind of speech made by some speakers&#x2014;not by members of your Lordships' House&#x2014;with reference to the Navy. It is always a temptation, no doubt, at such a moment to a certain class of persons of a certain order of mind, to treat it as a sort of common form of political controversy to assume that your opponents are indifferent to their national duty. Therefore I think we may sweep all such dusty electioneering rubbish aside. But altogether apart from that, it certainly cannot be denied that the position as regards the Navy Estimates which we shall have in due course to present, is a serious one and will involve considerable further sacrifices on the part of the taxpayers of the country. I do not propose on this occasion, for very obvious reasons, to discuss naval questions at all. I have no
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0042"/>
<col>33</col>
doubt that when all the facts of the case are in the possession of noble Lords opposite, they will desire to have a full debate on the subject. We shall be quite ready then to meet noble Lords in any critical observations that they may care to make, and I state with no little confidence that, in my opinion, we shall be able to show that we have in no way neglected our duty in regard to this important branch of the defence of the country.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I return for a moment to the question of Supply. It will be necessary in another place&#x2014;I say this really because the noble Marquess's observations on this and on the concluding paragraph of the Speech were, I think, in some degree framed with a desire to obtain information as to the course of business&#x2014;that, in the first place, the Supplementary Estimates will undoubtedly occupy some little time. But the noble Marquess rather twitted us with having foretold a condition of financial chaos and seemed to think that affairs were, as a matter of fact, proceeding with ordinary financial smoothness. On the contrary, the situation in which we find ourselves financially is most extraordinary and unprecedented. The first thing to be dealt with is the War Loan, &#x00A3;21,000,000 of which is due to be redeemed on April 5, which means that provision has to be made for issuing Exchequer bonds to that amount before Easter. In addition to that the Exchequer have borrowed another sum of &#x00A3;21,000,000; that is to say, &#x00A3;21,000,000 which ought to have been raised by this time and would in the ordinary course have been raised by this time by the ordinary process of taxation, but which has not been raised because your Lordships did not pass the Finance Bill. That means that powers must be taken to issue Exchequer bills running for a longer term. It will also be necessary to appropriate the whole available balance from the Sinking Fund for the purposes of the Treasury. Altogether some twenty-five millions have to be found before Easter, and if noble Lords opposite consider that to be a usual and normal financial position for the country I am afraid I must beg to differ from them. Also, I should like to point out that it is not merely a question of accounts and passing measures rapidly through another place, but it also definitely means a heavy dead loss to the Treasury and to the country. And it is a loss which will be felt, and the confusion will be felt, not merely this year, but, in the
<col>34</col>
opinion of those best entitled to speak, it will undoubtedly affect the collection of the taxes for the year 1911&#x2013;12. That being so, I do not think that the noble Marquess opposite is entirely justified in speaking, as he did, with something almost approaching pride, of the action of your Lordships' House and its effect upon the finances of the country. The whole position is in some degree complicated by a fact for which I do not hold noble Lords opposite responsible&#x2014;namely, that Easter this year falls on the 27th of March. And therefore all these matters have to be settled some days sooner than would have been the case if the moon had behaved in a different manner.<lb/>
The noble Marquess next touched upon a matter to which, as he said, no reference was made in the Speech&#x2014;namely, the subject of Home Rule for Ireland. I have no desire to discuss the question of Home Rule for Ireland at this moment, although I am always willing to do so at the appropriate time and place. But the noble Marquess made an allusion to what the Prime Minister said on this subject at the Albert Hall. Now, I would ask him to remember what occurred. When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Government assumed office at the end of 1905 there was a general understanding which, at any rate, bound so many members of the Government that it might be regarded as a Government understanding, that what was known as a Home Rule Bill would not be brought forward during the course of the then Parliament. That was the common knowledge of every one. The Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, had, after Parliament was dissolved through the act of your Lordships, to meet his supporters again. He either had to repeat that declaration or to say that it no longer held good. It is open to noble Lords opposite to say that we ought to have repeated that self-denying ordinance. What the Prime Minister did was to say that it no longer held good, that he was free&#x2014;as every Prime Minister and every Government are free on every other subject in the world&#x2014;to bring in a measure, if he thought fit, before the Dissolution of the present Parliament. What the impropriety of such a proceeding was I confess I cannot see. It seems to me the most natural, almost inevitable, course, and it was one, I think, which was expected, not only by the supporters of the Government, but also by its opponents.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess went on to taunt us in a kindly way on what, I think,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0043"/>
<col>35</col>
he called our allies&#x2014;the two Parties who in the House of Commons are neither the Liberal Party nor the Unionist Party&#x2014;and he made some comment upon our relations with them. I could not help thinking that, when the noble Marquess was speaking, he seemed to be under the impression which some of his supporters in the Press and on the platform appear to have had&#x2014;namely, that he and his friends had won this election. I should like also to make one other observation. The noble Marquess twitted us with the fact that the Nationalist Members in Ireland are likely to vote with us in another place. You speak of an alliance. Is such a thing entirely new and unknown in our politics? I have never heard that noble Lords opposite and their Party have refused the votes of anybody who was good enough to walk into the same Lobby with them. I will go a great deal further, and say with the utmost confidence that if these despised so-called allies of ours were to see their way to walk into the same Lobby with the friends of noble Lords opposite I do not think we should find them saying <i>non tali auxilio</i>. They would gladly welcome their co-operation if it offered any opportunity which would place them on these Benches.<lb/>
Now I come to the last subject&#x2014;that with which the remainder of the Speech deals&#x2014;namely, the relations between the two Houses. I am not sure whether it was on this or the previous subject that the noble Marquess commented on the mildness of the language used in the gracious Speech. That, I think, follows precedent. It is not usual, I think, for His Majesty's advisers to insert imprecations or strong language of any kind into the gracious Speech. But on this question our position is exactly as we stated it before the Dissolution of Parliament. It was stated by my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack in the course of the debate on the Budget. It was stated by myself in winding up that debate, and it was restated by the first authority of all, the Prime Minister, in his speech at the Albert Hall. That position is that, unless we can obtain guarantees of a statutory character, or, if you like, statutory guarantees&#x2014;I think that was the phrase I used myself&#x2014;statutory guarantees that the state of things which has obtained during the last four years will not be a permanent state of things, we cannot either retain or assume office; that is to say, that our retention of
<col>36</col>
office is for the purpose of obtaining those guarantees. That is, of course, the reason why, contrary probably to all precedent, no propositions of general legislation are to be found within the gracious Speech.<lb/>
It is generally admitted&#x2014;it was admitted by the noble Marquess just now, and, I have seen it admitted, I think, in a hundred speeches&#x2014;that the present composition of the House is not in conformity with the powers which it claims to exercise. That is to say, your Lordships opposite, the majority of the House, in acting as you do, are conscious that you are acting with a certain lack of authority. I read a great number of speeches, many of them made by noble Lords opposite who do not often appear on the public platform, some of whom, I think, must have felt like the Homeric gods at the Siege of Troy, coming down to take part in the combats of mere mortals. All through those speeches I noticed that consciousness&#x2014;a sort of apologetic consciousness&#x2014;of a lack of authority on the part of the House of Lords which they felt constrained to admit; there is, that is to say, a general agreement that something has got to be done. That has been the opinion of many noble Lords in different parts of the House for a long time past. My noble friend Lord Rosebery has often, I think, expressed his astonishment that during all those years when your time was so ample and your authority so undisputed in both Houses of Parliament you never made a serious effort to deal with the House of Lords question. The result of that, of course, is that the question has not remained and could not remain where it was, that it is no longer a question&#x2014;or, if you like, a question only&#x2014;of the reform of the composition of the House of Lords, but it has also become a question of its power.<lb/>
If I rightly apprehend the noble Marquess's observations it is not the intention of noble Lords opposite to propose any discussion of this subject until they have seen, at any rate, the main lines of our proposal. I have noticed that the noble Lord opposite, Lord Newton, has once more put clown on the Paper a Motion for the discussion of the Report of what is known as my noble friend's (Lord Rosebery's) Committee. I had long wondered why that discussion never took place before. I am told there is a practice which obtains among horticulturists of latter days of placing the bulbs of certain
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0044"/>
<col>37</col>
plants in ice in order that they may flower at some time of the year at which they would ordinarily not be supposed to bloom. I was under the impression that this Motion of my noble friend was, if I may use the expression, now at last going to be taken out of cold storage, and going to be allowed to bloom in your Lordships' garden.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00211"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: I will take it out whenever it suits the noble Earl or the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00212"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was going by what the noble Marquess said. He seemed to indicate that no discussion will take place. I do not at all quarrel with his view, I may say in passing, because it may be more convenient to discuss the question as a whole and at one time. That being so, I should venture to assume that the noble Lord's Motion will not be put down for a very early date. That brings me to the question of the noble Marquess as to the time at which these proposals of ours will be considered. I think it is due to ourselves and to Parliament as a whole&#x2014;I say frankly that I think it is especially due to this House&#x2014;that at any rate the outline, and, if possible, more than the bare outline, of our proposals should be placed before the, country as soon as possible; but when the noble Marquess asks me when they should reach this House in the form of a Bill, that of course is a question which I cannot venture to answer because I cannot say how long the discussion may occupy in another place. I have no doubt there will be a full discussion there. I also most cordially agree that there should be full discussion here, and I have not the least doubt that, if the Bill did not reach your Lordships' House in time to give it that fair measure of discussion which it will undoubtedly deserve, you would probably refuse to consider it at all. Whether your action in so doing would be of a just character would depend upon the dates and circumstances which we are not yet able to foresee. Then the noble Marquess asked me if we hoped to pass the Bill this session. I think I can be hardly expected to give to that question an answer beyond the general one that any Government which brings in a Bill hopes to see it passed. After all, this Bill may obtain such a measure of approval from your Lordships' House that you will desire to pass it, and if so you undoubtedly will pass it. More than that I cannot say. The noble Marquess, I feel
<col>38</col>
sure, did not expect any very definite answer from me when he asked me to foreshadow, even in the baldest outline, the contents of that Bill. I am afraid I must ask the House to wait until our proposals have been laid before the country, and I do so not merely because it is unusual to discuss the provisions of a Bill in any way before it is introduced, but because anything I might say, knowing how little I could say, would be probably of a misleading character.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00214"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I did not say a full account, but if I remember aright the noble Marquess put one or two searching questions to me as to the meaning of certain words which appear in the gracious Speech. I can only say in conclusion that I hope when we have laid our proposals before your Lordships' House they will be considered, as I am sure noble Lords opposite would desire to consider them, on their merits, without any undue manifestation of Party spirit, and with a desire to arrive at a result which will be of a permanent character and for the benefit of the country at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00215"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not intend to take, any part in this discussion this evening. There is, however, one topic so urgent and so vital to this House which is discussed in the gracious Speech and on which I unfortunately do not find myself in full agreement with my noble friend behind me, that I feel it my duty to detain you for a very few minutes while I endeavour to lay stress upon it. Were it not for that I might have been tempted to delay for a moment to consider the various tempting topics which have been raised by my noble friend opposite, such as the announcement made to the Irish on the Irish question at the Albert Hall. With the interpretation of that announcement I for one agree with the noble Earl, but as to the interpretation which was placed on it by others I should say that was a different matter. I think the noble Earl was accurately interpreting what was said by the Prime Minister. I do not think the Prime Minister is bound in the least by any of the comments that may be placed on it by others; but at the same time it cannot be denied that un-contradicted interpretations from authorita-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0045"/>
<col>39</col>
tive quarters in other considerable parties of the State were placed on those words and must have had a considerable effect on the electoral vote. I say I do not consider the Prime Minister is in any way responsible for those interpretations.<lb/>
I should also have liked to wander for a moment into the inquiries, so tempting to one's curiosity, as to what was the nature of the statutory guarantees which the Prime Minister was entitled to demand before, as I understand, he could ever face Parliament again. If my noble friend had thought well to dilate on them and to go into more detail on that subject, I am quite sure he would have spoken to a rapt and fascinated House. Nor am I tempted to dwell on one particular portion of his speech which relates to the measures soon to be introduced with regard to this House, and its relations with the other. As a matter of privilege and courtesy it would seem that a measure affecting the constitution of this House should properly be introduced in this House. There does not seem to be any intention of pursuing that procedure, and so we must be content with the somewhat languid promises held out of, at some future time&#x2014;ranging from the end of summer to the beginning of winter&#x2014;being permitted to examine a measure so vital to our existence. Whether that very tardy progress adumbrated by my noble friend will be altogether congenial and agreeable to those fiery horses of the sun of various colours that now drag the chariot of State is a matter into which I will not pause to inquire; but when I see that the coalition&#x2014;the, what am I to say?&#x2014;the other members who are accessory to the support of the Government in the other House, are anxious, without a moment's delay, without waiting for the necessary Supplies on which my noble friend has laid such, almost tearful, stress, to be allowed to fly with bared fangs at the throat of this House, I cannot guess, because I am not in their counsels, how agreeable that tardy progress, as of Cleopatra down the Cydnus, of this immaculate Bill will be to the supporters of His Majesty's Government who do not sit behind them, but who form part of the Irish or Labour contingent.<lb/>
After all, we meet in a very strange condition of affairs. This election is unique, so far as my experience goes, in being an absolute disappointment to every Party
<col>40</col>
engaged in it. My noble friends behind me, I do not doubt, counted, with the guileless enthusiasm of their natures, on obtaining a majority over the Government. The Government, engaged in great financial measures beloved of the masses, and also engaged in a vast constitutional contest from which they could hardly be restrained by any counsels of moderation, also reckoned on preserving the unlimited confidence of the country. The Government were also disappointed. The Irish party, always solid, always homogeneous, was also disappointed. It finds itself no doubt still an Irish party, but with a small collection within its bosom of what I believe in savage warfare is called friendly natives&#x2014;who are, I fancy, about as friendly to the general body of the Party as a friendly lawsuit usually is to those who are engaged in it. The Labour Party also finds its numbers considerably reduced. Therefore, we may say that no Party in the State has any reason to congratulate itself on the result of this election except in so far as it has been rendered more compact by its results.<lb/>
But there is one feature of this election which is, I think, very worthy of your serious consideration as members of the House of Lords. There is no doubt that a majority of some 120 or 125&#x2014;I forget the exact figures&#x2014;are returned to Parliament animated by the greatest animosity against this House. Even then it requires a little analysis before we arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. There is a Government majority, I think, of two as against the Opposition. There is a Labour Party of forty, and&#x2014;I am subject to correction in my figures&#x2014;it is also solid as against the House of Lords. Then there is the Irish Party, or two parties, which are, I suppose, equally animated by the wish to remove this House; but with regard to this very important section of the majority of 124, in which I suppose eighty or eighty-two Irish are counted, we must remember that they do not wish the House of Lords removed for large constitutional purposes, but avowedly and solely because it constitutes an obstruction to what is called Home Rule. Bearing that in mind, we must remember that their purpose is only temporary, because after Home Rule is conceded, whenever that may be, I take it that that Irish Party will occupy itself no further with Imperial concerns, and will have little care or reckoning whether any House of Lords exists or not. I think
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0046"/>
<col>41</col>
it must be said, therefore, that, analysing the majority against the House of Lords, the purpose of the Irish is in the main a temporary and not a constitutional one. I think we may further say that as regards a considerable number of subjects the Irish Party are more in sympathy with the House of Lords than with the House of Commons&#x2014;questions relating to education, licensing, and so forth, on which the two Houses have been of late in considerable opposition.<lb/>
I come to the point on which I differ with the noble Marquess behind me. I cannot help thinking that this is a golden moment for the House of Lords, a golden opportunity which may not recur, and that it is one which we should avail ourselves of with as little delay as possible in order to right ourselves with the public, and to put ourselves in a position to resist attacks which may weaken not the House of Lords as at present constituted but the Second Chamber, which is infinitely more important to the country, and so render a public service to the nation. I confess that when I heard the counsels of tardiness from my noble friend, and the counsels of not less leisureliness from my noble friend behind me, I felt my heart sink. Whatever you may say about the majority in the House of Commons, there is one thing every man will tell you who has had anything to do with the elections in Scotland, or I believe north of the Humber or the Trent&#x2014;which he will tell you emphatically&#x2014;and that is that wherever the Unionist candidates attempted to gain seats they broke their shins against the hereditary character of the House of Lords. That is the inherent vice of this House, which the country will not tolerate, which, however long you attempt to tide the matter over, you will never succeed in convincing them of the justice of, and that is the very root of the matter to which this House, in my opinion, if it is worth anything at all, should apply itself without delay. I do not wish to see this House forced under compulsion to take a measure which may seem accelerated by that compulsion, and which therefore may seem wanting in the dignity and self-respect which this House owes to itself. I say this is an opportunity which may not occur again of setting our own house in order&#x2014;an opportunity, without waiting for the somewhat leisurely progress of the Bill which is to come before us, of placing our plan before the country, and
<col>42</col>
then allowing the country to judge between the plan of the House of Commons and our own. I take it that after all that is the real issue.<lb/>
I hear thunders poured forth against what is called the veto of the House of Lords. There is no more a veto of the House of Lords than there is a veto of the House of Commons. There is a concurrent right of legislation, and if in the course of centuries one of the two branches of the Legislature has become either weakened or decayed, or is not in all respects up to the requirements of the times, it is for that branch to strengthen itself. It is then not a question of the veto, but a question of the constitution of our Second Chamber. It is for that reason that I heard with great pleasure, or read with great pleasure, in the gracious Speech from the Throne, that there was to be a measure introduced for regulating the relations between the two Houses, and also for reconstituting this House, as I understand it, for placing it in a position which can scarcely be called predominant with regard to the other House of Parliament. I rejoice, because it seemed to me that the Government had determined to abandon the fatal path on which they embarked a few years ago, when they brought forward those most unhappy Resolutions directed against this House&#x2014;inept in form, but murderous in substance, because they tended to a single Chamber system.<lb/>
It is perfectly obvious that when you had reduced this House to the position of lying passively down whilst a Bill is passed three times over its stomach&#x2014;the process of what the Chancellor of the Exchequer calls going straight to the Throne without the intervention of the House of Lords&#x2014;it was quite clear that when that had been established you would have had a single Chamber Legislature, and this House would have ceased to exist. I presume&#x2014;though the language of the gracious Speech is not altogether promising, the undivided authority of the House of Commons over finance and its predominance in legislation hardly looks like the parallel course of legislation to which we have been accustomed&#x2014;that the House of Commons' measure will not go on the lines of those Resolutions.<lb/>
What I want to urge is this&#x2014;that if under this measure introduced into the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0047"/>
<col>43</col>
House of Commons this House has to sit clown without resistance under the absolute predominance of the House of Commons, you will have very much the shadowy legislation portrayed in the Resolutions of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. I admit that it is courteous in a sense, it is right in a sense, to wait for the proposals of the Government, though they themselves would have shown perhaps a happier tone if they had introduced them into this House; but that I quite agree, in view of the conditions of their existence, is not practicable. Does that preclude us from taking such measures as we think fit to lay before the country our views of what the reform of the House of Lords should be? Suppose the proposals of the House of Commons or the Government should show a completely predominant House of Commons&#x2014;I think those are the words in the King's Speech&#x2014;and a completely subordinate House of Lords, will not the country say this is a Single Chamber that is proposed, and will not they say, What alternative is there to the proposals of the Government? Will it not then be necessary for the House of Lords to have some plan which it may show as the approved alternative of this House?<lb/>
If the plan of the Government does mean a Single Chamber, as I cannot help fearing it may, is it not certain that it will not pass this House, even if it be the last act of authority this House is destined to exercise. If that be so, is it not certain that the competitive plans must go before the country at a General Election, and that we should be in a position, very unfortunate, very naked, if we had not a suitable plan of our own to put forward? Should not the nation be seized of the plan of the House of Lords to reform itself <i>pari passu</i> with the plan of the House of Commons to establish its predominance over the House of Lords? I should not have dilated so much on this subject if I did not feel most earnestly and strongly the vital character of the opportunity which is now before us. I believe the country expects it. I believe the country, while resolutely opposed to the hereditary nature of this House, is equally determined to have a strong and efficient Second Chamber.<lb/>
If we in this House do not set our hands to the work, somebody else will do so for us. Suppose you proceed by Resolution. Suppose from this Bench, which exercises
<col>44</col>
the power in this House, a series of well-considered Resolutions were to be placed before this House, suppose the House resolved itself into Committee of the Whole House to consider these Resolutions, and after unlimited debate and discussion&#x2014;I would not check that or diminish that in any way, you cannot discuss these matters too much&#x2014;you were able to produce a series of Resolutions which recommended themselves to the country as being your deliberate views regarding your own future position, would not that be a great advantage? The one vital objection the country has to this House is its hereditary nature. You may say it would not look well that an election should seem to have driven you into recognition of this fact. You have indirectly already recognised this fact. You appointed a Committee at the instigation of my noble friend Lord Newton, of which the most remarkable result was that unanimously, and almost as it were spontaneously, that Committee came to the resolution that in the future the mere possession of an hereditary peerage should not entitle the bearer to a seat in this House. You have had that principle laid down by your own Committee; you have nothing to do but to affirm it as a House, and you have then taken the first step in the work of your own reform&#x2014;a work which in my judgment, if it is worth anything, and I have sat in this House as long as most, is the prerogative of the House itself.<lb/>
I urge this, not so much because of the House of Lords itself, but of something infinitely more important than the House of Lords, or any of its privileges&#x2014;the existence of a strong and efficient Second Chamber which shall be able to keep the balance of the Constitution and prevent its heeling over to one side, as is desired by many in the other House of Parliament. We have to protect, by the constitution of an efficient Second Chamber, the country from a great tyranny. A great man, a great democrat, a great revolutionist, not inferior, if I may say so, in sagacity or wisdom to any of our present rulers&#x2014;I mean Mirabeau&#x2014;said to Barnave&#x2014;I am sure my noble friend the Secretary of State for India remembers it&#x2014;that of all tyrannies the most insupportable is that of a Single Chamber. It is because of that tyranny which seems to overshadow us, and which it is the aim of many should overshadow us, that I venture to urge your Lordships

<title>THE DALAI LAMA OF TIBET.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00244"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask the Secretary of State for India the Question which I have put on the Paper&#x2014;namely, whether he can give any information to the House about the reported flight of the Dalai Lama of Tibet to India, or about recent affairs in Tibet; and whether he proposes to lay Papers before Parliament. I may say that it is about two years, if not longer, since last we had any Papers about Tibetan matters laid before either House of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00245"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is quite natural that the noble Lord should put a Question on this subject, because the incident is, no doubt, a most remarkable and interesting performance. The Dalai Lama left Peking on December 21, 1908, and is reported to have arrived at Lhasa on December 25, 1909. Very little is
<col>52</col>
known of his movements between those two dates, but he appears to have spent two months at Nagchuka (eight or nine days journey from Lhasa) before proceeding to the capital. It had been rumoured for some time that there was considerable friction between the Tibetan Government and the Chinese officials. This was said to be increased by the activity of Chao Erh Feng, former Viceroy of Szechuen, who had been appointed Amban in March, 1908, and with a Chinese military force was slowly advancing in Eastern Tibet, where he had been for some months in the neighbourhood of Batang, awaiting no doubt the arrival of the Dalai Lama.<lb/>
No information at all has reached Calcutta how the crisis was precipitated. But about January 30 the British trade agent at Gyantse received a visit from a Tibetan official specially sent by the Dalai Lama, and this official stated to our agent that the Chinese army was at Chiamdo (about 400 miles from Lhasa), the Tibetan troops being massed half-a-day's march from it. Nothing more was heard until February 17. The British agent telegraphed that day that forty Chinese mounted infantry had arrived at Lhasa on the 12th, that the rest of the Chinese army was close to the city, and that the Dalai Lama had fled the same night in the direction of India. He arrived at Phari (accompanied by three Ministers, three <i>shap&#x00E9;s</i>, and about 100 men) on the 17th, after a fight with the Chinese at Chaksam. He stayed at the British dak bungalow. He arrived at Yatung, which, as the noble Lord knows, is in the Chumbi Valley, on the 20th, pursued by the Chinese, and left the next day for Gnatong, whence he is expected to arrive at Darjiling, in British India, on the 27th, three days from now.<lb/>
On receiving news of the Dalai Lama's flight the Government of India at once issued orders to the British Agents at Gyantse and Yatung, and to the Political Officer in Sikkim, to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality. This has been scrupulously observed. The only communication that has been received from the Lama since he quitted Lhasa is a message left by him with our Trade Agent at Yatung to the effect that he was proceeding to India to consult the British Government, to whom he looks for protection. He gave no
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0052"/>
<col>53</col>
indication of the cause of his flight, except that the people of Lhasa had been greatly oppressed by the Chinese, mounted infantry having arrived and fired on the Tibetans, killing and wounding some of them. He thanked the British Government for the courtesy with which he had been treated.<lb/>
I ought to tell your Lordships that about ten days ago a Tibetan deputation arrived at Calcutta, and a similar deputation waited on the British Minister at Peking on the 21st instant. Both of these parties had left Tibet before the crisis, however it arose, became acute, and came to Calcutta and Peking for the purpose of notifying the Dalai Lama's return to Lhasa, and representing the grievous trouble the Tibetans were in. Upon arrival at Darjiling the Dalai Lama will be invited to occupy Hastings House at Calcutta until other arrangements can be made. Strict neutrality will continue to be observed; but he will be received with the courtesy and respect due to a ruler of high spiritual authority, who is an object of veneration to many millions of His Majesty's Indian subjects. His Majesty's Government at home are in communication with the Chinese Government with regard to the unexpected situation which has thus been created. They have no information beyond the very meagre information I have been able to give to the House which could with advantage be laid before Parliament. The noble Lord asks for Papers. My impression is that there are no Papers really worth producing, or which it would be advantageous to produce at the moment, but I will look carefully into the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00246"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Are there no Papers throwing any light on the situation at Lhasa? I gather from the statement of the noble Viscount that Lhasa has been virtually occupied by a Chinese force, with the result that this high official, whom the noble Viscount properly describes as being an object of veneration to many millions of His Majesty's subjects, has been forcibly expelled from Lhasa and has taken refuge in British territory. I should have thought that there would have been some information available as to that fact, and whether Lhasa has been occupied by a Chinese force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00247"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I think it would be premature to say that the Dalai Lama has been forcibly expelled. Of course, the most meagre and curt
<col>54</col>
statements have been supplied to us, and what they amount to is that he has fled. The exact and precise reasons why he fled we do not know, nor do we know exactly when the Chinese either marched into Lhasa or assailed the Tibetan force. The state of the Tibetan mind was explained to the Government of India by deputations, but I will look further, and if I can find Papers worth producing I will certainly not fail to produce them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00248"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask whether the Chinese Government has given any reasons for marching this force to Lhasa.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00249"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: No; the communications with the Chinese Government have only just begun. They are conducted, as the noble Earl knows, by the Foreign Office. When anything occurs at Peking which is of interest to your Lordships and can be prudently put before the public, I will, of course, take the opportunity to do so if the Foreign Secretary consents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00250"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: By Papers I do not mean Papers merely about the transactions which have culminated in the incident which the noble Viscount has described. I mean Papers carrying forward the history of the policy of His Majesty's Government towards Tibet from the date when the last Papers were laid before Parliament. As far as I remember, this was done just before we had the debate on the Anglo-Russian Convention two years ago, and since then His Majesty's Government have been pursuing a policy towards Tibet about which we know very little, but which will most likely and properly come under the attention of Parliament. It would help us materially if we had all the Papers on that aspect of the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00251"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I understood that the noble Lord did not refer only to this new incident, but that he wanted all the Papers since the present Government took office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00252"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Yes, if we can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00253"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I will look into that subject.</membercontribution></p>

The four Returns for which I move were rendered to Parliament last year in almost the same form as that for which I now ask. The first Return deals with the Special Reserve, and the noble Lord will recognise that it is almost the same Return as that which was rendered in April of last year to Mr. Arnold-Forster, with this exception&#x2014;that I am asking for the number of officers, whilst the Return granted to Mr. Arnold-Forster was limited to non-commissioned officers and men. Numbers 10 and 11 in the first Return for which I ask are designed to give information as to how many men are now in the Special Reserve who are medically unfit for the Army&#x2014;that is to say, the number of men who are medically unfit for the Army in time of peace, but who are considered fit for the Army in time of War. This information, as I know from my own experience of work at the regimental depots, can be very easily supplied. In the second Return I ask for a statement of the extra battalions of the Special Reserve precisely in the same form as the Return which was rendered last year. The third Return which I request the noble Lord to lay upon the Table was known last year as the Army Officers (Deficiency) Return, and was rendered on March 2. I ask that that Return should be brought up to date. The fourth Return concerning the Territorial Force is in almost the same form as the Return which was granted to my noble friend Lord Newton, with the exception of the addition of those men in the Territorial Force who have undertaken the obligation to serve abroad. I also ask for the number of such men who, being under twenty years of age, are not available for foreign service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00334">I have also a Notice on the Paper calling attention to a paragraph which appeared in the <i>Morning Post</i> of December 17, 1909, to the effect that Mr. Harold Harms-worth, who, early in the year, gave the sum of &#x00A3;10,000 to the Chairman of the Territorial Force Association, County of London, for recruiting purposes, had sent a further sum of &#x00A3;5,000 to the association for the same object. I wish to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War if, in the event of the statement being correct, he can state how much money
<col>64</col>
was paid either by the association or by any person acting under the association to (<i>a</i>) bringers of recruits; (<i>b</i>) recruits.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00335"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would like to say a word or two about the Return for which the noble Duke has asked. As he says, all the information that he desires was supplied for the corresponding periods last year, and there is, of course, no military objection whatever to providing it. But the preparation of these Returns last year brought out a fact of which, I think, we were to a certain extent ignorant when we granted the Returns&#x2014;I refer to the enormous amount of work entailed in providing the information in exactly the form in which the Returns were moved for. I do not in the least desire, however, to withhold from the noble Duke or from the House any information which may be required on these subjects. We can supply all the information the noble Duke seeks to obtain if the form in which it is asked for is in certain cases slightly modified; and if he would allow us to confer with him on the question we could probably arrive at a slightly modified form which, while giving all the information sought for, would throw a great deal less work on the record offices and upon the headquarters of the Territorial Force. I would therefore suggest that the noble Duke should do us the honour of paying a visit to the War Office, when we might confer on the question, and, I hope, come to a conclusion which would be satisfactory to him and at the same time save our people a great deal of work.<lb/>
In reply to the noble Duke's Question concerning the gift to the London County Association, I have to say that the War Office has no official knowledge of the matters referred to in the Question. I may add, however, that I am informed by the London County Association that the money in question was not given to the Association to administer, but to the chairman to apply exactly as and how he personally saw fit for the benefit of the Territorial Force in London. The Association as a body has neither knowledge nor control over the administration of the fund, and it was only on this specific understanding, as contained in a letter from the donor, that the sum was placed at the chairman's disposal. The money stands in the names of Lord Esher and Mr. Martin Holland, who jointly administer it, and the account is duly audited.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0058"/>
<col>65</col>
The chairman of the County Association informs me that, while considerable sums have been spent to encourage recruiting, the money was not expended in the manner suggested in the latter half of the Question. Owing to what was called the "recruiting boom" of last year direct payments of the kind suggested were Unnecessary. The chairman, however, asks me to add that, except for this fund, it would have been impossible, in his opinion, to have raised the numbers of the Territorial Force in London to their present strength.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00336"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Lord for his promise to grant the information for which I ask, and I shall have much pleasure in calling upon him at the War Office and conferring with
<col>66</col>
him as to any modification in the form of the Returns. With regard to the noble Lord's answer to my second Question, mae I remind him that paragraph 684 of thy Regulations of the Territorial Force provides that "an account of the receipt and expenditure of money received from private sources, either for general or specific purposes, shall be kept in suitable form and audited." Am I to understand that this Regulation does not apply to this particular sum?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00337"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: That is so. It does not apply on account of the conditions under which the money was given.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NAVAL MINE-SWEEPING.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00360"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether they have considered the desirability of altering the regulations and conditions that govern the entry of the officers and men of the Royal Naval and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves, so as to be able to enter a new class for coastal service such as mine-sweeping, which would be drawn from officers and men in the short sea trade, and from fishermen and others engaged in coastal work, so as to release for other duties a large proportion of the officers and men of the Royal Navy who would otherwise be employed on this service; and also whether they have made or are making arrangements to put on an Admiralty List for mine-sweeping purposes a sufficient number of steamers locally employed, such vessels to be available within twenty-four hours of an emergency.<lb/>
During war the entrances to our harbours and certain channels round our coasts will have to be constantly swept as a matter of daily routine. The enemy will sow tares by night and in foggy weather, and we must sweep them up by day. As we are short of seamen, any arrangement by which the number of officers and men of the Royal Navy employed in mine-sweeping can be reduced must be advantageous, as it would leave more of the <i>personnel</i> of the regular service available for other duties. There are many seafaring men around
<col>70</col>
our coasts, such as pilots, fishermen, and short sea traders, some of whom have never been on long sea voyages. Many of these men are married, and might be disinclined to remain away from home for a lengthened period, but they would probably be ready to enter a service in which they might expect to return to their homes at short intervals. Such men would not be much use amidst the complicated machinery of a modern man-of-war, but would be perfectly competent to act as helmsmen, leadsmen, look-out men, or boatmen, or as part of the engine-room complement of small steamers. Of course, a few experts would be required when mines were actually being encountered. Such experts should not be constantly employed on deck or at stoke-hole duties, but should be kept fresh and unfatigued ready for the performance of their more scientific mechanical work.<lb/>
The Admiralty have recently made experiments with trawlers as mine-sweepers. The results are, I understand, confidential, so that I shall not touch further on the subject except to say that there are numbers of vessels of larger size and greater speed than our trawlers to be found among passenger and other steamers engaged in local traffic. Some of these boats and a considerable number of trawlers should be surveyed and contracts made for taking them over in case of emergency, either by hire or purchase. Whenever an enemy's ship was sighted, speed would be an advantage. Arrangements should also be made for taking over the whole or part of the crews of such vessels. During the Spanish-American war the United States took over large mail steamers and their crews as going concerns, giving temporary commissions to their officers. Agreements of this kind ought to be made in time of peace, so that we should not find ourselves unprepared during the first fortnight of a war&#x2014;the time when this country will run most risks.</membercontribution></p>

The amount outstanding is &#x00A3;21,300,000. Of the &#x00A3;30,000,000 the National Debt Commissioners have bought up &#x00A3;8,700,000, and they are prepared to take a further &#x00A3;300,000, leaving about &#x00A3;21,000,000 to be met. We are obliged, therefore, to take further powers to provide for this sum, and we propose to raise the money by Exchequer Bonds. The Bill itself consists of one clause. Subsection (I) deals with the raising of money for the purpose of the redemption of the War Loan; subsection (2) deals with defraying expenses incurred in connection with the raising of the money; and subsection (3) and the Schedule deal with the manner in which the War Stock and War Bonds are to be redeemed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00367"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill to enable the Treasury to borrow money for meeting expenses authorised by the Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Act, 1909, and the Appropriation Act, 1909. These sums amount to, roughly, &#x00A3;125,000,000, and the amount which we have actually borrowed so far is &#x00A3;29,800,000. That is not an exact figure; it is approximate, because I understand the figure varies from day to day. It will be seen, therefore, that the borrowing
<col>72</col>
powers of the Government are by no means exhausted; but under the Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Act we are obliged to repay such borrowings by March 31 of this year&#x2014;that is to say, if the money borrowed is on Treasury Bills. We now seek not to obtain a new power of borrowing money, because, as will be seen, we have powers already, but to prolong those powers which we already have and to issue new Bills with a life beyond March 31. To show that this matter is one of considerable urgency I may mention that in three days time Bills for &#x00A3;4,500,000 fall due which otherwise, if this measure were not passed into law, could only be renewed for three weeks. The Bill is one of but two clauses. Subsection (1) of the first clause deals with the extending of the time during which the Treasury may borrow, and sub section (2) fixes the form under which the Treasury will have to borrow under this Bill. Clause 2 deals with the partial suspension of the Sinking Fund. With regard to that, I may say that it is, of course, obviously undesirable, if it can be avoided, to pay off debt with one hand whilst borrowing on the other hand to do so; and I may quote what Mr. Austen Chamberlain said on this point in another place. He admitted the temporary necessity of suspending the Sinking Fund for this purpose. I think that that, perhaps, absolves me from saying any more on this particular question. But it may be of interest to the House to know that, notwithstanding our suspending the Sinking Fund as we contemplate doing under this Bill, the deadweight Debt for the year 1909&#x2013;10 will be reduced by some &#x00A3;9,500,000.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"On the motion for the Second Reading of the Treasury (Temporary Borrowing) Bill to call attention to the delay of His Majesty's Government in laying before Parliament their proposals for raising the revenue necessary for the current year; and to ask for information as to the date when those proposals will be made known to this House."</quote>
said: My Lords, I ventured to put this Notice on the Paper because it seemed to me that it would scarcely be creditable to this House if this Bill were allowed to go through without some words of comment. It deals with large and important financial transactions&#x2014;transactions touching very closely great issues
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0062"/>
<col>73</col>
in which this House has played a conspicuous part&#x2014;and it is, moreover, to be passed through all its stages with a rapidity which stands out in marked contrast to the leisurely pace at which His Majesty's Government are proceeding with the main financial provisions of the current year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00370">The Bill, as the noble Lord who has just addressed us explained, deals with two separate questions. It authorises temporary borrowing by His Majesty's Government, and it also authorises the diversion of certain large sums of money, amounting altogether, I think, to &#x00A3;6,300,000, from the purpose for which it has up to the present time been earmarked. I mean the reduction of the indebtedness of the country. Both of these transactions are, on the face of them, obviously of an undesirable character. I could quote copiously from statements made by colleagues of the noble Earl opposite in regard to the desirability of providing for the year's expenditure out of the year's income, and, with regard to the Sinking Fund, I do not know that there was any feature in the policy of the present Government upon which the Prime Minister appeared more to pride himself than his policy of effecting a steady diminution of the National Debt through the operation of the Sinking Fund. Unless my memory plays me false, I think the Prime Minister once described himself as the "vigilant custodian" of the Sinking Fund, and the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of the Bill readily admitted that any disturbance of the arrangements for reducing the debt of the country was in itself undesirable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00371">It seems to me, therefore, that, if my description of the contents of this Bill is an accurate one, we are entitled to say that it requires not only justification, but the amplest justification, at the hands of His Majesty's Ministers. The official defence of these proceedings, and I have no doubt we shall have it presently from the noble Earl, is that these exceptional measures are inevitable on account of the rejection of the Finance Bill in the month of December last by this House. I am quite ready to admit that the rejection of that Bill obviously led to a situation in which exceptional financial measures have to some extent become inevitable. But the question is whether these particular arrangements are justifiable, either wholly or in part. Now, with regard to
<col>74</col>
the Sinking Fund, I appreciate the argument used by the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of the Bill when he told us that it was scarcely reasonable to expect that His Majesty's Government should pay off old debt with one hand while they were incurring new debt with the other. That, I think, is <i>prima facie</i> a reasonable way of putting it, and the only question which I am inclined to ask with regard to that part of the case is this&#x2014;I assume that a great deal of this taxation, which has not yet been collected and to replace which this borrowing is to take place, will eventually be recovered, and I should like to know whether His Majesty's Government have it in contemplation, when those sums have been wholly or in part recovered, to restore to the Sinking Fund any part of the money which they are now diverting from it? I dare say the noble Earl will be able to give me, in general terms at all events, some answer to that question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00372">But, my Lords, the question of temporary borrowings seems to me to need much more justification. I am, at any rate, disposed to suggest to your Lordships that the transaction which we are invited to approve is in itself a disadvantageous transaction to this country. I suggest that it is being resorted to without sufficient reason, and I suggest in particular that it might have been avoided either wholly or in part without any departure from the principles which His Majesty's Government have themselves laid down or from their own feeling of self-respect. I shall endeavour to explain what I mean. I wish, in the first place, to remind the House of the offers which we made in December last, if I may so put it, officially on behalf of the Opposition, to agree then and there to any reasonable proposals for meeting the disturbance in our financial arrangements which the rejection of the Budget of course occasioned. I regard it as beyond question that if those offers had been accepted the difficulty with which His Majesty's Government are now endeavouring to deal would, if it had not disappeared altogether, have been immensely diminished in extent. Our offer was rejected&#x2014;rejected, I must say, with something like acerbity. I do not attribute acerbity to the noble Earl opposite because when I first ventured to make the suggestion in this House he passed it by without any notice at all. But the overture was
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0063"/>
<col>75</col>
certainly rejected elsewhere, and rejected on the ground that His Majesty's Government did not desire&#x2014;I think this was the way it was put&#x2014;to have any truck with the House of Lords on a question of this kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00373">It seems to me that our offer was very much misunderstood and very much misrepresented. It has been described as a suggestion on our part that His Majesty's Government should take back their Budget and bring it to us again trimmed, altered, and presented in a shape more acceptable to us, but less acceptable to its authors. But I can assure the noble Earl that when we made that proposal we had no idea whatever of suggesting anything that could be reasonably regarded as offensive to the <i>amour propre</i> of His Majesty's Government. We were thinking not so much of the dignity of His Majesty's Government as of the interests of the British taxpayers. We found that owing to our rejection of the Finance Bill the arrangements for the year had been put out of joint, and we desired as reasonable and patriotic people to do what we could to diminish that inconvenience without prejudice whatever to the main issue which we desired to have referred to the people of this country. We were thinking, as I said a moment ago, of the interests of the taxpayers; and I am afraid you were thinking of the things that might be said of you by some of your own malcontents. His Majesty's Ministers were obdurate then; and they have remained obdurate ever since, for I take it there is no doubt whatever that if they had chosen, they could during the present session of Parliament either by a short and uncontroversial Bill or by a Resolution of the House of Commons have regularised the payment of a great part of these taxes, to which I shall refer presently, and which have been tendered in payment of their obligations by the people of this country, but which His Majesty's Government have declined to receive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00374">What is the argument which has been used to justify this refusal? It is suggested to us that the financial scheme of His Majesty's Government must be regarded as a complete, carefully-composed whole, of which no single part or fragment could be dealt with apart from the rest, and we are told that it has become the custom in this country to embody the whole of the finance of each year in a single measure, and that it is an unheard-of tiling that any
<col>76</col>
part or portion of that measure should be dealt with separately from the rest. I own that that argument does not greatly impress me. I believe I am right in saying that the custom of dealing with the whole of the finance of the year in a single measure under the title of the Finance Bill does not date further back than the year 1894, and I cannot, for the life of me, see that there is anything so binding in the precedent then created as to make it impossible for the Government of the day, at a moment of emergency, to depart by an inch from the arrangement which has become usual.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00375">The position which His Majesty's Government have taken up seems to me, I must say, quite untenable, and I do not think they are able to hold it. What is their argument? It is a two-fold one&#x2014;first, that no part of the Budget of 1909 is to be brought before Parliament unless the whole of it is brought up; and the second position is that they are not to come to this House for assistance. My Lords, the Bill on the Table fails to comply with either of those conditions. This Bill contains a proposal to divert &#x00A3;3,500,000 from the Sinking Fund&#x2014;a proposal which was part of the Budget of December last. That fragment of the old Budget you are reviving. You are dealing with it by itself in this Bill, and you are coming to this House, and not only coming to this House, but you are asking this House as a special favour to allow you to pass both these Bills through all their stages at a single sitting. I cannot for the life of me see why this proceeding, judged by your own standard, should involve no loss of dignity; why you should think it consistent with your dignity to come to this House and ask for leave to borrow money with which to pay your debts, when you are too proud to come to this House and ask for its assent to the taxes themselves. That does seem to me, I must say, a piece of technical, I will not say pedantic, reasoning which I think will not appeal very strongly to the public outside these doors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00376">May I revert for one moment to the taxpayer? In these days we do all that we can to encourage thrift. Now the transaction proposed in this Bill seems to me the most thriftless&#x2014;I might almost say the most prodigal&#x2014;transaction which financial ingenuity could contrive. What are you going to do in this Bill? You want a certain number of millions of pounds. You are going to borrow these
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0064"/>
<col>77</col>
millions from the public. You are going to pay&#x2014;so I see it stated&#x2014;something like &#x00A3;10,000 a week as interest on the money you are going to borrow. But you refuse to take the same millions, or a part of them, from the same public when the public comes with the money in its hand and asks you to take it. Surely that is bad business if ever there was bad business. And when you come to the manner in which this policy is being applied by those who have to give effect to it I own that I am very considerably puzzled, and I hope I may be able to elicit some explanations from His Majesty's Government. I understand that at this moment the Bank of England, with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;I suppose I might say under the direction of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;are deducting income-tax at 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;1 from the salaries of our Civil Servants. I also understand that the banks are collecting income-tax, at the same rate, at the source, and consequently hold large sums which they have in their hands at this moment, but that the Somerset House authorities refuse to accept payment of these sums&#x2014;refuse, that is, to take the usual steps for the purpose of regularising the transaction, without which steps, of course, as prudent people of business, the banks are not very likely to consent to pay the money over. I am still more puzzled because I have heard since I came into the House this evening that in some parts of the country demand notes for the payment of income-tax are, as a matter of fact, actually being issued. So that I really want to know what the policy of His Majesty's Government is. Are they going to block these payments, to raise official difficulties in the way of their being made? Or are they, on the contrary, going to facilitate them and to do what they can to collect this large amount of over-due taxation? The proceedings, as far as they have taken place up to the present time, seem to me, I must say, to be proceedings likely to create and to prolong that very chaos which His Majesty's Government anticipated with so much alarm when we took the step of referring the Budget to the people. Of course, I am aware that some loss to the taxpayers is inevitable. There will be a loss, I take it, under the head of Stamps; there will be a loss, though not a very large one, under the head of Land Taxes, and a loss on the Death Duties. But what I want to know is why to that loss, which
<col>78</col>
is no doubt regrettable, His Majesty's Government are trying to add the further loss which the taxpayer must inevitably sustain owing to the failure to collect this money.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00377">The singularity of these expedients certainly seems to me to be a fresh illustration of the unfortunate results which are occurring, and which are bound to occur, from the procrastination of His Majesty's Government in proceeding with the Budget of last year. The withholding of that Budget seems to me to be most unfair to the country; and it is certainly most unfair to your Lordships' House. I would ask your Lordships to call to mind the language which was used by His Majesty's Ministers themselves with regard to the Finance Bill. It was described to us as a measure likely to create a new heaven and a new earth for the people of this country. We were told that we were doing a cruel wrong to the people in withholding from them the blessings showered upon them by this Budget. And when it was rejected by this House the first official announcement that was made by the Prime Minister was an announcement in the most unambiguous terms to the effect that the first business of the new Parliament, should the Government come back to power, would be to reintroduce their proposals and give validity to the measures which had been taken in the interim.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00378">Throughout the whole of the election campaign, in almost every speech delivered by the adherents of His Majesty's Government, this statement was put in the forefront, that the first object and aim of the Government was to bring back their Budget and to force it through this House. The public was told that the Budget had been murdered, that John Brown's body was mouldering in the ground, but his soul was marching along. We were told that the Budget was to be brought back and driven through&#x2014;"rammed through," I think was the expression&#x2014;over the heads of this House. We were told that it was to come back unaltered, unmodified in the slightest particular, and unless I am mistaken the Chancellor of the Exchequer intimated his personal conviction that the Finance Bill would be on the Statute Book by March 31. When we read the gracious Speech from the Throne we found in it a statement which to us at any rate appeared to point to nothing else but this, that it was
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0065"/>
<col>79</col>
the intention of Ministers to place the Budget in the front rank and before any of their other proposals. I ventured so to interpret the King's Speech, and I was not corrected by the noble Earl opposite. That, after all, was a perfectly intelligible and perfectly justifiable policy on the part of His Majesty's Ministers. They had appealed to the people, we had appealed to the people, and the question which is now being pushed to the front&#x2014;the Veto of the House of Lords&#x2014;obviously arose only in the second line, because, if this House was right and rightly interpreted the views of the country in rejecting the Budget, then there could be no question of condemning us or of taking exception to the manner in which we had used our right of Veto. Surely in these circumstances the first duty of His Majesty's Government was to ascertain authoritatively what the finding of the country was on the question of the Budget.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00379">But what has become of all that zeal, that desire for a prompt ascertainment of the views of the country? Six weeks have passed since the elections virtually came to an end, this is the third week of the Parliamentary session, and the Budget still hangs fire. If it was wrong of us to stand in the way of the progress of the Budget, why is it right for you to stand in the way of the progress of the Budget now? And is there not, perhaps, this difference between your action and ours, that we held the Budget up in order that the people might have the opportunity of expressing their opinion upon it, whereas you, as far as we can understand matters, are holding up the Budget in order to prevent the representatives of the people from saying, in the proper place, what their view with regard to the Budget is? I trust earnestly that the noble Earl will give us some enlightenment on this point, that he will tell us why the financial proposals of the year are being held back, that he will tell us how long they are going to be held back, and that he will also tell us one or two things in regard to the conditions under which these proposals will be resuscitated whenever they are resuscitated. We should like very much to know whether when we see the Budget again it will be the same Budget, or whether you, in your turn, will perform any of those trimming and altering operations which you deprecated so much when we suggested them? Will there be an expurgated edition of the Budget for special consumption on the other side of St. George's Channel? Then is there any truth in the statement,
<col>80</col>
which is widely current, to the effect that when your proposals come before us we shall find that the old Budget and the new Budget are, as it were, telescoped together, and so mixed up that it will be impossible for us to ascertain with accuracy how far the original Budget has disappointed the expectations of its framers?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00380">And, above all, we should like to know this&#x2014;whether when the Budget comes up again it is to stand or fall on its own merits, or whether its merits are to be mixed up with another question, the question of the Veto of the House of Lords. Are we to see that verdict to which both sides looked forward confused in such a manner that some of those who may support the Budget will vote for it because they like it, while others will vote for it, in spite of their dislike for it, and because they regard it as a means of effecting the ulterior object they have in view&#x2014;I mean the disruption of the United Kingdom? If that is the way in which the issue is to be put, all I can say is that I for one can scarcely regard it as fair fighting. It may be very slim, very ingenious, but I do not think it is the kind of ingenuity which will greatly commend itself to plain people in this country. But whatever may be thought of it outside the walls of Parliament, I do venture to say that such a course would be grievously unfair to this House, this House which joined you in your appeal to the people of this country, which is ready to abide by the result of that appeal, and which now waits for the verdict which the people of the country have been invited to give.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00381"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it will be for the convenience of the House if I proceed at once to say a few words in reply to the observations of the noble Marquess. The noble Marquess seems to take a more close and intimate interest in these financial questions than do many of his right hon. friends in another place, who, I observe, are apt to leave these discussions rather to the skirmishers and <i>franctireurs</i> of their party, instead of invariably taking part in them themselves. The actual financial position as it stands has been stated by my noble friend behind me in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, and the noble Marquess has drawn attention to various points connected with it. He first of all drew attention to the further raid which it has been found necessary to make upon the Sinking Fund. That is, of course,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0066"/>
<col>81</col>
in itself a regrettable circumstance, and the fact that that raid has to be made only shows how serious is the position created by the action of your Lordships at the end of last year. The noble Marquess asked whether it would be the object of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to restore to the Sinking Fund as much as possible of what was being in a sense unduly taken from it, if the financial position permitted of his doing so later on. Of course I have not had the opportunity of consulting my right hon. friend on that point, and I am sure that it would be impossible to prophesy at this moment; but I can say this, speaking generally, that it clearly must be the object of any Chancellor of the Exchequer to maintain so far as possible the payments to the Sinking Fund for the extinction of debt. But as to how far the leakage, which necessarily takes place before the arrears for 1909&#x2013;10 can be collected, would prevent any such replenishment of the Sinking Fund, that, I take it, is a matter as to which it is impossible to give any opinion at this moment.<lb/>
The charge we have to meet is that of needless delay in dealing with the financial position. The noble Marquess recurred to what took place in December last when he made what he evidently still considers to be a very handsome offer, that is to say, to assist us in passing into law certain parts&#x2014;although we have never heard exactly what parts&#x2014;of the Finance Bill which your Lordships rejected. I cannot help thinking that the noble Marquess was scarcely serious in expressing surprise that that offer was not accepted. The offer was of the kind which was once described by Cardinal Newman as "an olive branch shot out of a catapult." It certainly never occurred to any of us that it would have been possible to enter into a transaction of that kind, for reasons which I will develop a little later on. But for the moment I will only say that, assuming it to have been impossible for us to accept that offer then, January and February were, at any rate, inevitably lost for the purpose of collecting taxes. Then when Parliament met in the middle of February it was evident&#x2014;as was explained by my right hon. friend in another place, and more briefly by myself here&#x2014;that the first duty which fell upon us was in connection with Supply. It was quite clear to anybody who knows the merest rudiments of how the money matters of the country are conducted that, however desirable it might be to collect the taxes,
<col>82</col>
what was absolutely imperative was to get authorisation for spending on Supplementary Estimates. And apparently the reasonableness of that occurred to everybody. No objection whatever was made in another place by the friends of noble Lords opposite to the taking of the whole time up to Easter for those necessary purposes, involving, as it did, a real hardship upon a very deserving class who get very little consideration now-a-days&#x2014;namely, the private Members in another place. Their time was taken without even a murmur from them, and the attitude of the Opposition in another place, I think, makes it clear that it was intended that during these weeks before Easter no other business of any kind should be taken.<lb/>
Well, the postponement of the formal collection of taxes undoubtedly, by common admission, involves a loss. It involves loss in two ways. You have to borrow money and pay interest on that money instead of receiving the money in the form of taxes, and the postponement may also involve, and in some cases probably will involve, certain irrecoverable arrears. Now, so far as regards the loss due to having to pay interest on the borrowed money, that, of course, is not disputed by anybody. The only point is whether the reasons which we give are sufficient excuse for asking the country to meet that loss. But as regards the question of irrecoverable arrears I do not think that it is likely that the postponement for a week or two more or less would make any appreciable difference in that respect, because it is important to remember that as regards the collection of these taxes there is no magic about the end of the financial year and March 31. You have got to collect the arrears of taxes. Whether you do it just before the close of the financial year or as soon as you can afterwards is not in itself an important matter, and, as some of your Lordships doubtless know, Income Tax is in no way concerned with March 31. It runs from April 5 of one year to April 6 in another.<lb/>
Now we come back to the question which was asked by the noble Marquess&#x2014;Why, at any rate, even if you were not prepared to bring in your Budget at once, could you not have brought in first a Resolution and then, I suppose, a Bill, to legalise the collection of Income Tax? The noble Marquess, of course, is quite right in saying that Income Tax, although it represents the major part of the deficit, by no means represents the whole. There are other sources of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0067"/>
<col>83</col>
taxation for which the Budget provided, where the failure to collect helps to swell the deficit in no inconsiderable degree. But before I proceed to say a word on the general question of the separate Bill, I should like to deal with some of the observations made by the noble Marquess as to what is occurring at this moment. He says that the Treasury has declined to receive taxes. That is not an absolutely accurate way of putting it. What has happened is that the official Commissioners of Income Tax have not thought it right&#x2014;of course under instructions from the Treasury&#x2014;to make a direct demand for Income Tax, on the ground that an official demand ought not to be made for taxes which cannot be legally recovered. You have no right to put the Government of the country into the position of making a demand which it is open to anybody to refuse to meet. The noble Marquess says that there have been cases in which demands have been made for Income Tax. Income Tax is not all collected by the official Commissioners who are subject to the Treasury. There is the body in London called Special Commissioners and there are also Local Commissioners in various parts of the kingdom who are not under the Treasury, and they in some cases have, certainly not improperly, but without direct authorisation from the Treasury, issued demand notes, and in the ordinary way also I understand that a very considerable sum in Income Tax has, as a matter of fact, been paid.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the question of whether it was the duty of His Majesty's Government, assuming it to be impossible, as it undoubtedly is&#x2014;it has been shown to be impossible&#x2014;to have brought in the Budget Bill during these first weeks of Parliament, because the time is given up to Supply&#x2014;whether we ought to have brought in a Resolution followed by a Bill for the collection of Income Tax. The noble Marquess has adduced various arguments to show that it was our duty to have done that. But I can assure the noble Marquess and the House generally that no question of wounded dignity or of <i>amour propre</i>&#x2014;I think those were the phrases he used, and they have been used elsewhere&#x2014;ever crossed our minds in connection with this matter. It is a very much wider and deeper question than that. It is a very great Parliamentary question, and to suppose that we should deliberately sacrifice, so far as we are sacrificing&#x2014;although the extent has been exaggerated&#x2014;the public funds to any form of wounded
<col>84</col>
pride, either as individuals or as a Government, I think is to do us some injustice, and I do not know that there is anything in the history of our four years of government which entitles anybody to suppose that we should act in such a manner. The arguments of the noble Marquess are very good as far as they go&#x2014;they are excellent for their purpose, but they are entirely what I may call bank parlour arguments; they are none the worse for that, but they only represent one part of the case, and it is necessary in dealing with this matter to look at the political situation as a whole. This situation of affairs is the indirect consequence of your Lordships' action last December, and people must be taken to intend the indirect no less than the direct consequences of their action.<lb/>
On this question of bringing up the Budget in more Bills than one I revert for a moment to the Budget debate of last December. At that time a number of charges of a rather random kind were made against us of having introduced tacked matter into the Budget. I think I am right in assuming now that those charges are entirely withdrawn. [Opposition cries of "No." They are not withdrawn? [Several noble Lords: "No."] Well, that, I confess, surprises me, and for the reason that I understood that you are going to pass the Budget when it comes up to your Lordships' House. It does cause me some surprise that you should say that you are going to pass a Bill into an Act which contravenes the old-established rule, admitted by us no less than by yourselves, against tacking. I make a present of that argument to noble Lords opposite. For I do not believe that the House ever seriously thought that the Budget Bill could be described as involving tacking&#x2014;that is to say, it did not contain anything foreign to or different from the matter of Aid and Supply. What I believe was in your Lordships' minds, although I see you do not admit it, was that the propositions of the Budget were various and novel and therefore ought to have been introduced in separate Bills, but that is an entirely different question. But it has this very real bearing on the position at this moment&#x2014;namely, that I think you will never find&#x2014;certainly you will not find it in this House of Commons; you may find another House of Commons more subservient&#x2014;you will never find that this House of Commons will agree to do anything which involves the splitting up of the Budget in any form into different Bills, and for the reason that they think, and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0068"/>
<col>85</col>
I am not at all sure that they are wrong, that your Lordships would be very glad to win back the practice, which you lost in 1861 and finally in 1894, of splitting up the financial proposals for the year into different measures. I confess I greatly admire the ingenious arguments by which the noble Marquess sought to show that this Borrowing Bill which we are now bringing in really offends in that respect, and that it involves a splitting up of the Budget. Dialectically that is extremely ingenious, but I do not think that the plain man, to whom the noble Marquess is fond of appealing and to whom he appealed to-day, will agree that this simple proposition to borrow money for a time on bills has any analogy with the division into different measures of definite propositions involving policy of taxation in a Budget. The two things cannot be compared. And although, as I say, I greatly admire the ingenuity of the noble Marquess's argument, I cannot admit that it was convincing.<lb/>
That, my Lords, is our position. We have to take the broad political ground on this matter. We greatly regret the necessity. We should, of course, have greatly preferred it had the House thought fit to pass the Budget and to allow matters to proceed in the ordinary course. But as that was not done, it is useless to expect that the other House will abandon the position which it has taken up. What would be said by any member of the majority in the House of Commons would be that something like a state of war exists at this moment between the two Houses. When a state of war exists you may have to blow up some of your own bridges and tear up some of your own line of railway, and those who suffer must be prepared to stand that temporary loss. If they are not prepared to do that, they had better go over to the enemy. If the country does not support us in taking this action I quite agree that the sooner we go about our business the better, and we must endeavour to adorn as best we can the private station to which noble Lords opposite would like to relegate us. But after all this is a practical matter.<lb/>
What is the practical issue? The practical fact is that no proposition of this kind to bring in one part of the Budget, even though it should save the country a certain amount of money, would have the faintest chance of succeeding in the House of Commons as it exists at this moment. Even if His Majesty's Government were
<col>86</col>
so impressed by the arguments of the noble Marquess that we endeavoured to engage in such a transaction, I do not believe there is one of those who support us in the House of Commons who would go into the Lobby in favour of a proposal of that kind. It is one of the occasions when, as was said in a well-known phrase, the <i>chassepots</i> would go off of themselves. Even supposing we were so deeply moved by the arguments of the noble Marquess that we would not go on as a Government, but placed our resignation in the hands of His Majesty, and noble Lords opposite came into power, they would not have the faintest chance, with the present House of Commons, of bringing about such a measure as is proposed. I do not believe for a moment that if noble Lords opposite, Say even with the concurrence of His Majesty's present advisers, were in office and attempted to get through a Bill of that kind, you would obtain a majority for it in the House of Commons, and the only effect obviously would be that until a new Parliament came together the whole matter would still remain <i>sub judice</i>, and the payment of these taxes would be still longer deferred. Therefore, my Lords, it is not practical politics to suggest that anything of this kind should be done. We do not think the suggestion reasonable, and if I have shown that it is impracticable, as I venture to think I have, I think that is sufficient for the purpose of to-day's debate.<lb/>
The noble Marquess at the close of his speech put one or two questions to me with regard to the Budget. I am afraid that, in view of the fact that the whole of the time in another place up to Easter is to be occupied with Estimates, it would be impossible for me to give any answer which I could describe as accurate as to the time when the Budget is likely to come up to your Lordships' House. I can only suggest, therefore, that it is open to the noble. Marquess to raise the matter again before we adjourn for Easter, and some of the questions he has put to me&#x2014;some of which, I confess, involve considerations which have never been brought to my mind at all, and of which I have never even thought&#x2014;he may think fit to put again at a later date. But I do not think it would serve any useful purpose if I were to offer conjecture, which is all I could offer, as to the course of business in another place when it has not been announced by my right hon. friend there; and therefore I must ask the noble Marquess to postpone

if he would be so good, such inquiries on this subject as he may wish to make.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00382"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REVELSTOKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with some reluctance that I venture to rise to address your Lordships, as I feel that the statement of the noble Earl the Leader of the House was animated by what your Lordships must above all things admire and respect&#x2014;absolute sincerity. If only we could feel equally assured of the wisdom and prudence of the policy which he has enunciated, there would be small reason to continue this discussion. My sole excuse, therefore, for venturing to occupy even a few moments of your Lordships' time must be this: There seems much in the present situation which goes beyond the legitimate field of Party politics and is concerned far more with the general financial welfare of the kingdom and the prosperity of the entire community.<lb/>
I am not aware whether your Lordships have gathered from the speech of the noble Earl a very definite reply to the most definite Question which was addressed to him by the noble Marquess. Are your Lordships to understand that the Finance Bill is to be reintroduced and passed into law with all its provisions as they stood when that measure came up for discussion in your Lordships' House in November last? Are your Lordships to understand that some modifications or alterations will be introduced? Are some of the clauses of this measure to be now omitted? Are some concessions to be made, possibly in order to satisfy the clamour of a section of the community with whom His Majesty's Government may have been forced to conclude a sinister alliance? It would be a convenience to your Lordships to have a clear understanding as to what <i>is</i> intended. These, however, are questions of policy which have been, and will be, debated by experienced and distinguished speakers on both sides of the House. I trust that I shall have your Lordships' approval if I limit myself to my humbler sphere, and if I endeavour to indicate how far the present situation affects the financial conditions of this country.<lb/>
There is one matter, and a matter of great importance, as to which no satisfactory reply has been received. This is the question of the collection of Income Tax. It is a question which has been fully debated in another place during the
<col>88</col>
last few days. Your Lordships may have gathered from the reports of these discussions that, in spite of the remonstrances and supplications addressed to them by those well qualified to express an opinion, His Majesty's Government seem intent on refusing to authorise the payment to the Inland Revenue authorities of sums which have been actually collected, and the receipt of which would obviate, to a great extent, the necessity of the large borrowing operations in which the Treasury has of late been indulging. Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to give a brief statement of what actually has occurred. On December 2 last the Prime Minister, in another place, made the following statement&#x2014;
<quote>"Our course is to advise, as we have advised, the Crown to dissolve this Parliament at the earliest possible moment. His Majesty has been graciously pleased to accept that advice, and the result, I trust, will be that a new House of Commons will assemble at such a time as to make it possible for it to provide, both retrospectively and prospectively, for the needs of the current financial year. If we are fortunate enough to enjoy its confidence, then our first act will be to reimpose from this week all the taxes and duties which were embodied in the finance Bill, and to validate all past collections and deductions."</quote>
This statement of the Prime Minister had a reassuring influence, in that it showed that no chaos need exist. No chaos need have existed; no chaos did exist at that time. In spite of assertions now, attended as they are by triumphant allusions to speeches at Birmingham and elsewhere to the effect that this chaos is an accomplished fact to-day, I venture to suggest to your Lordships that the only chaos now existent is that which has been deliberately engineered by those responsible for the present policy of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
On December 4 a circular was issued to bankers, coupon dealers, and others, signed by the Secretary of the Board of Inland Revenue, and concluding as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board are authorised by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to suggest that a similar course should be adopted on the present occasion, and that Income Tax should continue to be deducted at the rate of 14<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; pending the introduction of another Finance Bill for the current year."</quote>
On the strength of these official assurances, bankers and agents decided to continue to deduct Income Tax at the rate of 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. from the warrants and coupons which they were called upon to pay. I am well aware
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0070"/>
<col>89</col>
that these deductions have been technically illegal, and that Resolutions of the House of Commons are not in themselves sufficient to give a permanent authority to such action. I am aware that these Resolutions would have to be renewed at the birth of a new Parliament. But I am also aware that such Resolutions bear the sanctity which attaches to convenience and to custom, and I fail to see any adequate reason why His Majesty's Government, by a measure which they could pass in five minutes time, should not authorise the payment to the Treasury of sums which for some time have been actually at their disposal.<lb/>
It is, of course, quite true, as the noble Earl the Leader of the House points out, that the assessments are at this moment illegal. But surely this is a reason in itself for passing a law to make them legal. Assurances were given to His Majesty's Government that such a measure would be treated as non-contentious. I am led to believe that, during the last ten days, the evening sittings in another place have not been unduly protracted. Your Lordships will allow that the only people who have no right to the large sums which have been collected are those in whose hands they lie to-day. It is an irony of the present situation that the very capitalists whom this Government seem to regard with such suspicion should have a continued control and benefit of sums which surely should either be in the pockets of the taxpayers, or should be standing at the credit of a Government account. The apprehensions expressed last session in certain quarters&#x2014;and these not the least well-informed quarters&#x2014;that the welfare of the country was being sacrificed to Party interests are now unhappily confirmed by the extraordinary attitude of His Majesty's Government in wilfully creating financial chaos by refusing to regularise the tax collections. Much of this revenue, if not actually lost, is so hopelessly in arrear that I believe that the Treasury officials themselves would allow that the framing of a Budget for the next year or two will be more or less a matter of guess work.<lb/>
The figures of the Income Tax returns, allowance being made for these arrears, are a significant indication that the prosperity of this country is waning. The first nine months of the present financial year, say to December 31, 1909, showed a decline of &#x00A3;750,000, in spite of the application
<col>90</col>
of the 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. tax levied on interest, dividends, warrants, &amp;c. The figures up to the end of November last show a decrease of &#x00A3;600,000. It is hardly conceivable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have any intention of disguising these waning receipts by any such tactics as are evident to-day. It may be well for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to plead that there is no use in redeeming debt on the one hand, and borrowing afresh on the other. But why was the Government compelled to borrow? What must be the effect on the credit of a Government if, with millions in the hands of banks awaiting the Exchequer, it elects to borrow millions, to raise floating debt to abnormal amounts, and actually to suspend the redemption of the permanent Debt? I am no politician, and I fear I must apologise to the noble Earl the Leader of the House for what he will, perhaps, consider a bank parlour argument; but if this is not sacrificing great public interests to petty and Party ends I would be glad to be told how it should be described.<lb/>
What has occurred to justify so complete a change of front since the Prime Minister made the statement I have quoted in one of the concluding debates of the late Parliament? What one real, sound, or satisfactory reason can His Majesty's advisers advance against the course which was officially indicated as recently as December 2 last, and which is still indicated by common honesty and by common sense? Are your Lordships to understand that this new Parliament, in its tottering and uncertain childhood, dares not adopt a course which would result in an immediate saving to the taxpayers of England? Are your Lordships to be told that such are the unhappy disorders consequent on the preoccupations of faction that all habits of method and prudence are to be cast aside? Surely no! I trust that His Majesty's Government will be able to give your Lordships such assurances as will guarantee that attention to the interests of the public good and of public economy which the people of England have an undoubted right to claim.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00383"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not presume to enter upon those high questions of policy which have formed the subject of the speech of the noble Marquess. I will only venture to take that side of the question which deals with the financial machinery which is essential
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0071"/>
<col>91</col>
to the orderly management of our finance. In the first place, I was glad to see that the noble Marquess appeared to attach rather more gravity to the financial situation than he did at the time when the Finance Bill was under discussion in your Lordships' House. It has dawned upon him that the situation is a very serious one for the credit of the country; but I would hold that, as the matter stands now, no accusation of delay can be brought against the Government in the action which they have taken. It is necessary to understand what the actual situation is.<lb/>
The charge which the noble Marquess brings forward, as I understand it, is that the Budget ought to have been introduced, and ought to be at this moment before the House of Commons. I believe that that is simply an impossibility according to the necessities of our financial regulations. There are three authorities necessary for the conduct of financial business. The first of those authorities is the Votes of the House of Commons in Supply, which sanction the expenditure of the State; the second is a power to the Executive to borrow in order to make certain that money would always be in the Exchequer sufficient to meet the demands of the Public Service. Those two authorities are absolutely necessary. If the Votes in Supply are not passed, the Service&#x2014;and this is no mere method of speaking&#x2014;comes absolutely to an end. If the Votes necessary at the beginning of the ensuing year and those that are necessary at the close of this year are not taken before March 31, the simple fact is that the Controller of the Exchequer refuses to issue the money. There is no question whatever about that, and the point, therefore, is that before everything else, and before any deduction can be drawn from the words of the Prime Minister quoted to-night, the first thing absolutely necessary is that that provision should be made.<lb/>
The House of Commons met in the middle of February, and has only within the past few days been able to get into Supply. You have to bear in mind that provision has to be made before March 31 and must receive the sanction of Parliament before that date, not only for all Supplementary Estimates this year, but also for very large sums in the expenditure of next year. That involves discussion of the Army and Navy Estimates. It involves
<col>92</col>
a free discussion by the House of Commons of a great number of points, and in the circumstances which have been brought about by the action of your Lordships' House there was, in my opinion, no alternative before the Government but to devote the short remaining time up to March 31 to the discussion of those Estimates. It is no argument to say that on certain nights the House of Commons did not sit the full time, because this House knows as well as the other House that just objection is taken if there is not fair time given in another place to discuss the Estimates.<lb/>
Then when these necessary measures have been taken there comes the third authority&#x2014;namely, the provision of taxation, which is set forth in the Budget; but there is not an absolute necessity that the provision of taxation should accompany, or indeed follow closely upon, the provision of what I have ventured to call the financial machinery. In our history there have been various cases, all of them, as I venture to think, very bad precedents, which show what may be done. The most celebrated case, I suppose, of emergency of this kind is that of 1784, when Mr. Pitt apologised to the House of Commons, in bringing in his Budget, that for two years the whole of the provisions for the orderly carrying on of the finance of the country had been in abeyance on account of political turmoil. There were various other occasions on which, through political emergency, the Budget had been brought forward quite late in the year&#x2014;to give only one instance, Sir Robert Peel did not bring forward his Budget in 1841 until half of the year was over. I only mention these facts because I want to make it clear that the provision of taxation does not follow immediately, or necessarily very closely upon, the financial Votes. Therefore I cannot allow that the fact of the Budget not being brought forward immediately is not sanctioned by precedent.<lb/>
I wish to put in a <i>caveat</i> against these precedents, and I should be sorry to quote them as a precedent for what is being done now; but I maintain that it was absolutely necessary for the Executive Government to ask Parliament to give the remaining time up to March 31 to secure the necessary Votes, and that, though it is no doubt most desirable that the Budget should be brought forward without unnecessary delay,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0072"/>
<col>93</col>
there is nothing to make it absolutely necessary that it should be brought forward in one week or in another week. So far, I submit that no case has been made out against His Majesty's Government of having neglected their duty, or of having been guilty of undue delay in bringing forward their financial proposals; and the words of the Prime Minister which have been quoted to-night must be interpreted subject to the financial needs and machinery, without which the Public Service could not be carried on. But going beyond that, I do feel that some consideration is due from your Lordships' House to the Government in this matter. You must admit that it was by your act that the Budget was thrown out. It is not necessary for me at this moment to argue one way or the other as to the advisability of that course. You threw out the Budget saying that you wished to have the opinion of the nation upon it. Your wish was met, and the opinion of the nation was taken. But that has, necessarily, thrown us so far back that it has become impossible to make our present financial arrangements in order. Therefore I think your Lordships do owe to the Government a little consideration in the matter.<lb/>
The noble Marquess asked a question as to the Sinking Fund to which I think there is a very simple answer. If the revenue gathered in the ensuing year exceeds the expenditure the noble Marquess need hardly trouble himself about it, for, as a matter of course, that excess goes to the Sinking Fund; it is already provided for, and therefore there is no necessity for any special provision being made. As regards the collection of the revenue at the present time, I think all of us who have any experience in that matter are aware that supposing the Budget Bill could have been passed in the last few days it would make very little difference in the amount of revenue collected before the close of the year. Do not let me pass over the extreme gravity of the present state of our finances. On February 26 there was still due on the revenue something like &#x00A3;43,000,000, and at that time the expenditure exceeded the revenue by &#x00A3;18,000,000. That, my Lords, is a situation such as in peace has never, I am happy to think, happened before, and that it ought to be remedied as early as possible no person can possibly question. But I do feel that His Majesty's Government have been put in an extremely
<col>94</col>
difficult position and ought to have all due consideration given to them so far as the measures they take for regularising the financial position are concerned. The Budget, we may hope, will come before the other House early in April, and that is really as speedy a settlement of the financial question as we can possibly expect.</membercontribution></p>

I do not wish to occupy your time for long, because I feel that these Resolutions will be passed in due course, and they ought to be passed as they are for the good of the country. But I think we may learn from the experience of the present moment something which may be of use to us in days to come. First of all, I will take the case of the War Loan.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00387"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: If there is any point on which the noble Lord wishes to be reassured and will inform us privately, we will give him any assurance possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00388"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: There is one question as to the issue of Exchequer Bonds which I will ask the noble Earl privately. The Income Tax at the present moment is partly in the pockets of the people and partly in the pockets of bankers. Naturally enough, that leads to a certain amount of loss. Leakage is going on, and, as has been mentioned to-night, part of the Income Tax, owing to the delay in collection, will never be able to be realised. One effect on the money market of the non-collection of the Income Tax by the Government is that it tends to make money too cheap now. The general condition of things at this time of the year is that gold accumulates in the Bank of England, to whom it is useful during the autumn months when gold is in great demand. But now, owing to the extreme cheapness of money, we see a different state
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0073"/>
<col>95</col>
of things obtaining, and gold, instead of coming to this country, is being paid out in large quantities. Last week the Bank of England got rid of nearly &#x00A3;1,000,000 to France, South America, and India, and therefore the effect of the Income Tax not being collected in due course by the Government must lead to a very dear money market and to a good deal of interference with trade later on in the year.<lb/>
From the domestic point of view, the non-collection of Income Tax has led to confusion everywhere and a good deal of injustice. I will take this point. A man who has his money invested in Government Stock has his Income Tax deducted by the Government, but the man who has not his money invested in gilt-edged or Government or railway Stock has not paid his Income Tax. The result is that the Government have had to borrow large sums of money to pay for those who have not already paid, and the injustice comes in here&#x2014;that the man who has paid his Income Tax has also to contribute to the interest on the Government debt which has been created by those who have not paid. That is obviously unfair, and we are face to face, owing to the non-collection of Income Tax, with a deficiency of &#x00A3;25,000,000 and the sweeping away for the time being of our much-valued Sinking Fund. I think we may be permitted to smile on this side of the House when we remember the "People's Budget" and the flourish with which it was introduced. Financially, we are lapsing into methods of barbarism and are experiencing to the fullest extent government by a Party for a Party and not in the general interests of the country at large. People move their money out of this country; money is pouring out of the country. Whether that is wise on the part of the public I know not. I am inclined to think it is not wise. At the same time, I have great respect for the general opinion of this country, and when the country does express an opinion of this sort I look upon it with very great respect. Money is going out, and gilt-edged Stocks are once more beginning to fall.<lb/>
I am almost led to think that the Budget is being used as a kind of weapon against your Lordships' House. There seems to be a desire to make finance as difficult as possible in the future in case another Party should presently be in power. That, of course, is not for the good of the country.
<col>96</col>
I confess I was rather astonished to hear the noble Earl who leads the House say that we on this side have apparently come to the conclusion that there was no such thing as tacking in the Finance Bill. On the contrary, that was the principal argument of some of us against the Budget, and it still is. With regard to the Licensing Clauses, I have always held that that was a gross case of tacking, because the Licensing Clauses had been already embodied in a Bill which had been submitted to and rejected by your Lordships. I was also somewhat surprised to hear the noble Earl say that the country were not inclined to make the demand that the Income Tax should be collected. I should have thought that the country at large were very anxious indeed that the Resolution enabling the Income Tax to be collected should be passed. It would not interfere with the other portions of the Budget. But I remember the words of the First Lord of the Admiralty a week or two back, the sense of which was that the House of Commons were not inclined to listen at all to any recommendation from the House of Lords. There seemed to be a certain amount of pique in that statement, and I cannot help thinking that that is not the way in which the finances of this country should be conducted. I do not know why we are face to face with all this financial mess. I suppose it is merely to keep a Party in power who dare not bring in their own Budget for the arbitrament of the House of Commons. I think that if we had made up our minds to pass a short Resolution authorising the collection of Income Tax we should have gone far to make up the deficit which we shall now have to face, and that that would have been the proper course to pursue in all the circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00389"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was very interested and gratified to hear the opening remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Faber, because to-day we are discussing a definite thing&#x2014;the Treasury (Temporary Borrowing) Bill&#x2014;and the noble Lord said that these Resolutions ought to be passed as they were obviously for the good of the country. I was very glad to hear the noble Lord make that statement, and I wondered whether his remark was equally satisfactory to the noble Marquess opposite, who, in the course of his remarks, declared that the Bill was one of the most prodigal that had ever been introduced and was clearly against the interests of the taxpayer. That was a rather curious support for the noble Marquess to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0074"/>
<col>97</col>
receive from his banking friend who was put up to support his opinion from the financial point of view.<lb/>
The financial position of the country is undoubtedly a serious one, and I do not imagine that anybody would attempt to deny it. The noble Lord who spoke second on the other side&#x2014;Lord Revelstoke&#x2014;imputed considerable blame to the Government because he said a great deal of this might be put right by a Resolution passed by the House of Commons on the subject of the Income Tax. My noble friend Lord Welby has already dealt with that. The noble Lord opposite also spoke of the sanctity of House of Commons Resolutions. Such Resolutions used to have the force of law because they were followed by a Bill. But, my Lords, you have killed the sanctity of a House of Commons financial Resolution. A House of Commons Resolution is no longer as a matter of course followed by a Bill through both Houses, and such a Resolution standing by itself, and as things are, could not possibly, in the eyes of the Judges, have financial sanctity in future.<lb/>
I observe a curious difference in the attitude of noble Lords opposite from that which they took up when they threw out the Budget. I remember speech after speech on that occasion, and I have particularly in my mind the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Milner, who has had as much experience of the collection of taxes in this country as any one, in which the House was advised that no very bad muddle at the worst would occur if the Budget was thrown out. What do noble Lords say now? What does the noble Marquess say? He says that a serious loss to the taxpayers anyhow must be inevitable. I have no doubt he is right. He also said that the financial arrangements for the year were out of joint. He is certainly right. Noble Lords recognise that to-day, but it is a different attitude from the one taken up when they threw out the Finance Bill. Lord Revelstoke went even further. He said he believed that not only the Budget for next year, but I think he went on to say the Budgets for some years further on, must be to a great extent a matter of guess work. Those are all very serious statements. I do not know that the last statement is not rather beyond the mark of our present misfortunes, but there is no doubt that the financial position is very serious, and that noble Lords opposite now recognise that to be the case, yet they denied
<col>98</col>
that such a situation would arise when they threw out the Budget Bill.<lb/>
The noble Marquess who initiated this debate to-day made a rather curious complaint. He complained of the leisurely pace of the Government as regards their financial provisions, and he went on to say that their procrastination in regard to the introduction of the Budget was damaging to the taxpayers and extremely unfair to this House. If he is most anxious to have the Budget I should like to know whether he is answering for his Party that they are in favour of it. The noble Marquess reminds me of what I believe is a common trick in local elections in this country. When there is a very unpopular man in a district a request is sent to him asking him to stand for election, and then everyone votes against him. It is considered a rather low-down trick. The noble Marquess is saying. "Please bring in your Budget." Why, noble Lords opposite threw it out only a few weeks ago! I think whoever is entitled to ask for the Budget and to press for it there is one person who is not so entitled, and that is the noble Marquess. Then he went on to gibe at the Prime Minister because he is not able to pay off debt. He is not, unfortunately. The noble Marquess said the Prime Minister used to boast that as Chancellor of the Exchequer it was his desire to pay off debt. When the noble Marquess and his friends were in office they piled up obligations&#x2014;I am not saying it was their fault, but they did it&#x2014;and they left the country enormously heavier in debt than when they came into office. In three years the Liberal Government that succeeded them paid off &#x00A3;40,000,000. Then the noble Marquess took a hand again, and the present financial position of the country is the direct outcome of the action of the noble Marquess and his friends. I think the gibes of the noble Marquess at the Prime Minister were, in the circumstances, out of place.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess urges that at any rate the Government should try to pass some taxes through this House. The Government cannot do very much more than they have done; they have tried to pass all their taxes. It would be interesting out of doors if the noble Marquess would state distinctly which taxes he is in favour of. I suppose he is not in favour of the Land Taxes. I suppose he is not in favour of the Licensing Taxes. And if we are going into it at all would he mind telling us if he is in
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0075"/>
<col>99</col>
favour of the Super Tax? Some of the ablest speeches during the Budget debate were delivered against the Super Tax, but I have seen it stated that there were not a dozen election addresses which contained an attack on the Super Tax&#x2014;not a dozen candidates ventured to attack the Super Tax in the country. It would, as I say, be interesting if the noble Marquess would state distinctly which taxes he is in favour of, so that the Government may have some guide as to their future action. The noble Marquess laid great stress on the view that the Budget ought to come before the Veto. The noble Marquess and his Party have raised the whole trouble, but in his line of argument he is not likely to advance his own case, because people out of doors will see that the noble Marquess is extremely angry and upset because the Government are actually bringing in the Veto question before the Budget. The noble Lord who spoke second from the Benches opposite said the same thing&#x2014;that the Budget ought to come first. But when people are attacking you and you protest that the course taken is unwise, it is more than likely that they will press on their attack on those lines; in other words, they will not take the advice of their enemies when they are planning out a campaign against them. I also noted the extreme anxiety of the noble Marquess that the question of the popularity or unpopularity of the Budget should not be affected by the question of the House of Lords. I should have thought that the noble Marquess and his friends would have held the view that this House was so strong and so popular&#x2014;the most magnificent institution in the country, and an institution which all foreign nations envied&#x2014;that the fact of the inclusion of the question of the House of Lords would have been to their advantage. But it is clear that the noble Marquess is afraid that the Budget would get through under cover of an attack on the House of Lords. That is an admission on the part of the noble Marquess which we may carefully note and profit by.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00390"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition put two questions to the noble Earl opposite. In the first place he asked what was likely to be the future of the Budget, and secondly he asked why His Majesty's Government did not take steps to obtain the authority of Parliament for the collection of the Income Tax. With regard to the first question, I quite understand that the
<col>100</col>
noble Earl opposite is not in a position to make a very definite statement on the matter. Such a statement would naturally first be made in another place, and anything more indefinite than the statements on the subject which the other place has been favoured with cannot well be conceived.<lb/>
But I should like to know what was in the Prime Minister's mind when he said, on December 2, that the first act of the new House, if the Government obtained the confidence of the country, would be to pass the Budget which was rejected by your Lordships' House? The noble Lord on the Back Bench opposite, Lord Welby, suggested that the answer was that time was against any such proceedings; that in the first place it was essential to get Votes in Supply, and to obtain the authority of Parliament for the expenditure on the various Services. That I do not question for a moment. But again I ask what did the Prime Minister mean? He knew when he spoke on December 2 when the old Parliament would be dissolved, and when the new Parliament would assemble, and why then did he suggest, with his knowledge that the passing of certain Supply would be necessary, that the first act of the new Parliament would be to carry the Budget? I suspect the Prime Minister thought he would be in a position in the new Parliament to come down to the House of Commons and ask them to suspend their Standing Orders and pass the Budget by a single Resolution.<lb/>
The Prime Minister prophesied before he knew, and as the result we see that nobody can tell at the present moment whether the Budget which was rejected by your Lordships has or has not a majority in the present House of Commons&#x2014;in other words, has or has not the assent of the people&#x2014;or whether it will not be necessary to secure that assent for the Budget by coupling with it such measures, entirely different from the Budget itself, as will secure the support of the Irish Nationalist Party. That, my Lords, I think is the answer to the question which my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition asked of the noble Earl opposite with regard to the future of the Budget. His Majesty's Government, I have no doubt, are doing their best by perfectly legitimate political negotiations with the Nationalists&#x2014;assuming that they agree with the views
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0076"/>
<col>101</col>
of their Nationalist supporters, as I believe they do&#x2014;to secure that essential support without which the people's Budget cannot possibly become law. Meanwhile everything is delayed. The collection of taxes cannot take place. Nobody knows what the financial future will be, and we are obliged to resort to the expedients, contained in this Bill, of borrowing for the necessary expenditure of the country, because His Majesty's Government cannot make up their minds or cannot get the House of Commons to make up its mind, on the merits of the Budget of last year. The noble Lord who has just sat down said that if His Majesty's Government were to accept the suggestion of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, for an early production of the Budget, and if it came to your Lordships' House, my noble friend would suggest that your Lordships should again reject it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00392"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I suppose members of the Unionist Party in another place will vote according to their principles and consciences, and they have always voted against the Budget of last year. What my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition said was that if the present House of Commons returned the same Budget as was sent up last December your Lordships' House would pass it as the expression of the will of the people. Whether that will ever happen is one of the most doubtful things of the future.<lb/>
But a smaller issue, although a very important issue, is the question of the collection of the Income Tax. Here is a tax a very large proportion of which is collected in the first three months of the year. Practically the collection of the Income Tax before January 1 is very small indeed, and amounts to hardly anything but the arrears of the previous year. It is quite true that nothing which Parliament could do now would avoid the delay which has already taken place in the months of January and February, or avoid the possible loss which may have arisen through that delay. But if during the present week, or on an early day next week, His
<col>102</col>
Majesty's Government were to harden their hearts, and take the course I will venture to suggest to them, the collection of the Income Tax would be accelerated by some five or six weeks at the very least, a not unimportant matter in the collection of such an enormous sum as the Income Tax represents. What is the objection that has been raised to His Majesty's Government dealing with this matter? In the first place it has been said that the House of Commons gave up the time of private Members solely on the ground that there was certain necessary financial work to dispose of. That is true. But what can be more necessary than to secure the collection of taxes which everybody wants to pay, instead of borrowing and paying interest upon the sum which you could obtain from the taxpayers if you chose? Secondly, it is said that the whole time up to March 31 is so completely occupied with that other necessary financial business that nothing can be done to sanction the collection of the Income Tax. I cannot, of course, here discuss the procedure of the House of Commons. But what do we see? According to the daily newspapers the House of Commons adjourns day after day at a very early hour indeed, and hours remain which, I will not say are wasted, for I have no doubt hon. members employ them in a much more agreeable way, but which are not expended on public business, and which might be devoted to that purpose.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00396"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl says you cannot split up the Budget. I will quote the words of the noble Earl's colleagues. "The taxes of the Budget
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0077"/>
<col>103</col>
must be treated as a whole." "The Bill which authorises and ultimately gives the Resolutions Parliamentary sanction must also be treated as a whole." Then the Prime Minister said:&#x2014;"I decline to single out this or that tax for special treatment and special decision on the part of the House of Commons." That, I think, represents the argument of the noble Earl. But what does it imply? In the first place, is it true to suggest, as the Prime Minister suggested, that the Resolutions relating to the Budget must be taken together? I have had some experience on that point. I know how days, and weeks even, pass between the dates of the several Resolutions relating to the same Budget. Sometimes even months have passed. Even last year, the Government, long after the Budget had been introduced, had to pass a small Customs Resolution in regard to a 3<i>d</i>. duty on beer which afterwards had to be embodied in the Finance Bill. Therefore, there is no necessity for the Budget being treated together, so far as the Resolutions are concerned, and it is contrary to what has been the general practice in the House of Commons in my experience.<lb/>
Then the Prime Minister went on to say that the Bill which authorised the Resolutions and ultimately gave them Parliamentary sanction must be treated as a whole. I entirely agree. I have never suggested, nor do I think it ought to be suggested, to His Majesty's Government that they should bring in a Resolution authorising the collection of the Income Tax and embody it in a separate Bill to be presented to your Lordships' House. The noble Earl says&#x2014;I have no doubt with complete truth&#x2014;that there are certain persons&#x2014;I hope he did not include himself&#x2014;who regard the two Houses at the present time as being in a state of war, and that all the supporters of the Government in the House of Commons would unanimously reject any such proposition as that. I am not at all surprised at it. I speak as an old Chancellor of the Exchequer. I can assure your Lordships that the reason for embodying all the proposals relating to finance in one Bill is not only that the House of Commons desired, when Mr. Gladstone first proposed that course, to withdraw the facilities which this House had previously enjoyed in dealing with Money Bills, but also that no Chancellor of the Exchequer would be
<col>104</col>
willing to allow the great waste of time in the House of Commons which would inevitably result from separating the proposals of the Budget into several Bills. No Chancellor of the Exchequer, whatever his political opinions, would willingly go back to the old custom in that respect. Therefore, I should never suggest to His Majesty's Government that they should bring in a separate Bill dealing with the collection of the Income Tax, which would have to pass both Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
But why cannot the Government pass the invariable Resolution authorising the collection of the Income Tax, and allow the tax to be collected upon it? It is said that your Lordships put an end to all that when you rejected the Budget last year. I secured the rejection of a Budget in the House of Commons in 1885. The Resolutions had been passed, and taxes had been collected, which had to be paid back&#x2014;so far as they could be paid&#x2014;after the Budget had disappeared. It is perfectly possible to collect taxes under a Resolution, which Resolution is not afterwards authorised by legislation at all. I am not contending for a moment that the Resolution legalises the collection of the tax. I should be very sorry indeed if a Resolution of the House of Commons legalised anything of the kind. But it is the invariable custom to collect taxes on such Resolutions, even when afterwards the House of Commons refuses to sanction them by a Bill. I do not know in the least what objection there can be to such a course. I agree that it could not be adopted if the Government of the day had not the intention of passing into law the tax which the Resolution sanctioned. But does the noble Earl or anybody suppose that we can do in the face of our great expenditure without a 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. Income Tax for the year 1909&#x2013;10, and pretty certainly also, I am afraid, for the year 1910&#x2013;11? You have but to pass the Resolution as soon as you can in the House of Commons and embody it in a Budget Bill which can be passed at any time before Parliament is prorogued, and everything will be done in a perfectly legitimate and proper manner in accordance with universal practice.<lb/>
I should very much like to hear&#x2014;perhaps we may hear from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack&#x2014;what conceivable objection there can be to such a procedure on the part of His Majesty's Government. Is it that there is a state of war between the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0078"/>
<col>105</col>
two Houses? What I am suggesting does not require the concurrence of your Lordships at all, except to the Bill ultimately legalising the tax. If there is a state of war between the two Houses it is very curious to my mind that we should have had produced to us this evening these two Bills which we have passed with unanimity; for if such a procedure as I have suggested would offend the dignity of the House of Commons it must have been far more offensive to their dignity to ask the assent of your Lordships to these Bills, than to pass a Resolution passed by the House of Commons alone for the collection of the Income Tax. I do trust that even now His Majesty's Government may consider whether it is not possible for them to adopt such a procedure as I have suggested. I approach this matter in no Party spirit whatever. I do not suggest for a moment that the course which His Majesty's Government are taking is actuated by Party motives. Nobody can desire that we should borrow money, pay interest on that money, and lose taxes by delay because we will not collect taxes which we could very well collect. Is there any Party in the House of Commons which would be opposed to a Resolution authorising a 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. Income Tax? It is pretty clear from the debates which have recently occurred in that place that the Opposition would support it. The Labour Members have invariably supported direct taxation as against indirect taxation. The Irish Nationalists never in my time opposed a Resolution for Income Tax, and His Majesty's Government themselves must be in favour of a proposal which they themselves placed before Parliament. I contend that for a Government which has always had as its motto to pay your way, the course now pursued by them is so remarkable that it is impossible, consistently with the fairness that I desire to show towards them, to conceive for what reason they adhere to their present position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00397"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speeches to which we have already listened have so thoroughly exhausted this subject that my remarks need be very brief; all the more so because the only arguments I have to advance are rather of the order which the noble Earl opposite very accurately described as "bank parlour arguments." I venture to think that the "bank parlour arguments" are the only arguments which apply in this case, and that there is no necessity whatever, except it be a Party neces-
<col>106</col>
sity, for dragging in all the serious constitutional questions to which the noble Earl alluded in his speech. Looking at the matter from the bank parlour point of view, I very much doubt whether the archives of the Treasury contain any records of such remarkable financial transactions as those in which they are now engaged. On the one hand you have a creditor notoriously impecunious, and on the other hand a debtor who wishes to discharge his debts; the creditor turns round and says:&#x2014;"No; I insist on not being paid. Although it is ruinous to me, I prefer to borrow. Put your money in your pocket." A more remarkable financial operation never took place.<lb/>
Nothing whatever has been said as to how much these financial vagaries are going to cost the country. The Chancellor of the Exchequer did, in a burst of rather gloomy pathos, say, "No one can tell me how much I am going to lose over the Income Tax." It would have been more satisfactory if he had told us how much the country is going to lose over these transactions. It must be a very large sum. The noble Marquess mentioned a figure of &#x00A3;10,000 a week. I also noticed that in a leading newspaper, and I have seen other estimates. I do not know whether they are correct. So far as I can make out it amounts to this, that up to March 25 last about twenty-five millions were collected in Income Tax, and up to March 1 this year twelve millions were collected, thereby leaving a deficit of thirteen millions. Then there are three and a-half to four millions which the Chancellor of the Exchequer expected to get by the extra 2<i>d</i>.; that makes altogether seventeen millions of Income Tax. The interest on seventeen millions at two and a-half per cent. is &#x00A3;1,200 a day&#x2014;a very respectable figure to pay.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite said there was no peculiar magic in March 31. That is very true; but there is a certain amount of magic from the taxpayer's point of view about paying &#x00A3;1,200 a day more than we need. It is manifest that amid the incidents connected with Party management and a good deal of not very profitable recrimination as to who is responsible for the state of things the real national interests may be lost sight of. There can be no doubt on which side the national interest lies&#x2014;it is to cease borrowing and to collect the Income Tax as soon as possible. It appears to me that, judged by the financial standard, the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0079"/>
<col>107</col>
action of the Government does not admit of any adequate defence, and I must also add that after listening to the debate I am inclined to think that the political arguments are as weak as the financial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00398"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether the last words of the noble Earl are intended to suggest that there is some political malice at the back of the action of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00400"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: No, I do not suppose that his words were so intended, but I did not quite fully catch what the noble Earl said. I was glad to hear that the noble Viscount (Lord St. Aldwyn) has stated that he attributes no Party motives to the proceedings of His Majesty's Government. He also says&#x2014;what I think everybody familiar with the House of Commons, and with the proceedings in regard to money which have been so little considered in this House for a few hundred years until last December, would know&#x2014;that it was desirable, and even necessary, to have Supply before March 31. And therefore no complaint really can be made as to what is to be done before March 31, for the exceedingly good reason that the whole time of the House has, I understand, been secured for the purpose of Supply&#x2014;necessary Supply alone&#x2014;by the consent of all Parties in the House of Commons, and other business could not without their permission be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00401"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Not alone; there are these two Bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00402"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Oh, yes&#x2014;without their permission, I said, a permission which was given in the case of these two Bills. The result is a very lamentable financial condition, a most deplorable condition, and the country has to suffer for it. How was it created? It was created wholly and solely by the unprecedented and, as I think, constitutionally unjustifiable interference of this House by throwing out the Budget of last year. When I was young one used to hear all sorts of descriptions of causes and the relations of cause and effect analysed in various ways. There is no cause at all for the financial difficulty in which this country at present finds itself, except the fact that the Budget was thrown out last year. That is the sole and only cause of it, and your Lordships might well suppose that the House of Commons entertained a feeling of jealousy on that subject.<lb/>
<col>108</col>
The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, is not responsible for any part of this financial difficulty. It would not be courteous to have adverted to his absence from the debate on the Budget, but I do advert to his letter in the newspaper, which was published since the General Election commenced, in which he stated in substance that in his opinion there was no tacking in the Bill of last year. That was the opinion of one of the most experienced men in the House of Commons of this generation&#x2014;and of a Chancellor of the Exchequer of far the highest financial authority&#x2014;who has a seat in this Chamber. That was the view of the noble Viscount, but it was not the view of the majority, or on which the majority in this House acted, and the consequence is what we see.<lb/>
How is it to be remedied? The noble Viscount suggests that it should be remedied by a Resolution. He said with complete accuracy that Resolutions are passed in the House of Commons and that many Resolutions may afterwards be embodied in one Bill, that the Resolution for some reason well understood by the Constitution but not known to the law&#x2014;I draw attention to the difference&#x2014;has acted for we know not how many hundreds of years as a warrant, the sole warrant, under which money is collected, though it is but a Resolution of the House of Commons. Well, that has to be followed by a Bill. Why, says the noble Viscount, does not the Government bring in this Resolution; it would be less humiliating to them or to the House of Commons than to come and ask your consent to a Bill for borrowing money? We need to take with us this fact, that your Lordships have thought fit to disregard constitutional usage and custom. I remember that I respectfully submitted to the House a distinction between the constitutional usage and the law in a speech I made on the Budget of last year. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, afterwards went to Plymouth and in a speech did me the honour to refer to what I said. He said he really did not understand the difference drawn by the Lord Chancellor between the law and custom. He did not understand it. I should have thought that this House, above all places in the world, would support and maintain custom and usage, and would have known that the whole relations between the Sovereign and the Government of the day subsist upon custom and usage,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0080"/>
<col>109</col>
and not on the law, except in the minutest degree.<lb/>
If a Resolution for the Income Tax was brought in by the House of Commons all I can say is that, as I read and understand that House and its present temper and what is said there, they would regard that as a step towards splitting up the Budget. Splitting up the Budget again introduces another serious constitutional question, to which the noble Viscount has alluded. He knows as well as I do that in 1860 this House took a step which was deeply resented by the House of Commons&#x2014;that is to say, they refused to concur in a Bill for repealing the Paper Duty. That action of this House was made the subject of a reference to a Select Committee of the House of Commons. It was one of the strongest Committees&#x2014;it had upon it Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Bright, Mr. Disraeli, Lord John Russell, and Lord Palmerston&#x2014;and they made a Report which is the <i>locus classicus</i> on this subject, and which, I think, has not been considered by some of the noble Lords who have recently taken part in the debates on this subject. What did Mr. Gladstone do? The House of Commons resolved that they had it in their power to prevent an occurrence of this kind again, and Mr. Gladstone in 1861 and subsequent years brought all the Finance Bills of the year into one Bill in order that this House should never have an opportunity of treating a Finance Bill in the way they had except by refusing the whole Supplies of the year. The real beginning of that policy was in 1860.<lb/>
That was the weapon by which the House of Commons then used the power of the purse to prevent your Lordships from being able to throw out Money Bills. After what happened last year, when the whole of the mischief was done which has led to the financial confusion so bitterly deplored by your Lordships to-night, can you wonder that the House of Commons is a little afraid of this Assembly, which sees no difference between law and custom, which has forgotten altogether usage, and proceeds upon the bare law, will itself proceed upon the bare law, and is not prepared to put itself in jeopardy by bringing forward Resolutions which admittedly have not the force of law and collecting money upon them, for fear that that should be a weapon to encourage further encroachments upon the rights, as they understand them, of the House of
<col>110</col>
Commons? These are beginning to be the consequences&#x2014;the bitter waters that flow from the original fountain, and the original fountain was the throwing out of the Budget of last year; and it matters nothing whether the Budget of last year is passed again or not for the purpose I have in hand&#x2014;this has begun the strife which will never be abandoned by those who believe that the House of Commons ought to be the predominant House in this country, and it will end in consequences which even now we cannot foresee.<lb/>
Your Lordships ask why was the House of Commons not taking this line which would have been so natural a year ago. Yes, my Lords, a year ago! It might have been natural a year ago, but I declare that I do believe that the House of Commons are using the power of the purse&#x2014;the old familiar weapon with which they have broken down tyranny in this country and have effected so many things which are well known to students of constitutional history&#x2014;they are using the power of the purse, and it is a very heavy hand of the House of Commons when it lays it on the money bags, as everyone knows who knows what use has been made of it in the past. I regret extremely the occasion that has led to this financial embroglio, but I must respectfully tell your Lordships here&#x2014;I will not say these, things outside, because my loyalty to the House compels me to say them inside&#x2014;that I think that the fault is wholly your own, and that this present financial difficulty is the consequence wholly and solely of your action.</membercontribution></p>

We have yet to learn what the majority in the House of Commons do think about the Budget and about the financial policy of the Government. The noble and learned Lord said that the whole of the cause of the confusion in which the finances of the country are placed is to be laid at the door of your Lordships' House, and I think the noble Earl used similar language. The noble and learned Lord said we had given a shock to the old-established usage by which Resolutions of the House of Commons have the force of law even before the Budget Bill which finally sanctions them is passed. Why do the noble and learned Lord and the noble Earl surround themselves with such fictions. The difficulty does not lie with the House of Lords, but with the House of Commons. It is because the Government are not certain of being able to pass their Budget through the House of Commons that these difficulties have arisen. If the noble and learned Lord and his colleagues were quite certain that they had a majoirty in the House of Commons they would have produced the Resolution which the noble Viscount has just suggested to your Lordships they should produce. They would have produced the Budget and passed it under a novel guillotine Motion in one sitting. But they did not dare to do that. Why? Because they could no longer command a majority in the House of Commons on finance. Then why should the noble and learned Lord throw the whole blame upon us? Why is it our fault that they have not got a majority in the House of Commons, except that we did our best to prevent them. That being so, I would invite the noble and learned Lord to approach this subject, if I may say so, with a little more frankness. Let him recognise on the floor of your Lordships' House exactly how the state of facts really lies. There would be no difficulty but for the fact that the Government, having gone to the country on the Finance Bill, have been defeated in the country on the Finance Bill. That is the root fact of the situation. Whether the Government will be able, by the man&#x0153;uvres which in such very courteous language the noble Viscount described, between now and Easter to
<col>112</col>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00407"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord is good enough to say that he does not blame us because the House of Commons will not take the obvious course of passing this Resolution authorising the payment of Income Tax. He may say that, but I think we are entitled to blame the Government for not taking that course, and I shall be very much surprised if the country does not blame them as well. The Government cannot be under any delusion whatever as to the attitude of your Lordships' House in the event of the Finance Bill of last year passing the House of Commons. They have the pledge of my noble friend who sits behind me, and who speaks with absolute authority in your Lordships' House on a matter of this kind. If the Finance Bill is passed again by the House of Commons, of course it will pass your Lordships' House. Provided the Government command a majority in the House of Commons the Income Tax Resolution which we invite them to propose would have the force of law from the moment it passed and afterwards, because it would be confirmed by the Budget Bill which would be passed by your Lordships' House. If the Government do not choose to adopt that policy they do so with their eyes open, determined to arrange the elaborate political strategy which we have watched with growing amazement during the last few weeks, the object of which is to place the interests of their Party and of themselves above the interests of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PUBLIC SERVICES OF PEERS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00428"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have troubled your Lordships with any observations upon the Return for which I beg to move if it had not been that I am afraid I must give some explanation to noble Lords opposite, though that explanation would not be required by noble Lords who sit on this side of the House. Noble Lords opposite will remember that a Committee, moved for by the noble Earl who usually sits upon the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery, was appointed, and that they declined to take any part in it. Their intention, though it was not so at that time, is now more concentrated on the emasculation than on the reform of your Lordships' House. Therefore I may, perhaps, explain to noble Lords opposite that a Return analogous to if not identical with the one for which I am now moving, was prepared for the purpose of that Committee, and it occurred to me that it would be useful if that Return were brought up to date, reprinted, and placed in the hands of your Lordships before you proceed to discuss the Motion of which Lord Rosebery has given notice for Monday. No doubt I might have added many other categories of public service rendered by members of your Lordships' House, but I purposely refrained from doing so, because I wanted to confine it as closely as possible, while bringing it up to date, to the Return which was prepared by one of the officials of the House with great care and ability for the confidential use of the Committee. I notice that since my Motion was placed on the Paper a Motion has been put down for a further Return. I do not know whether the noble Lord in whose name that Motion stands intends to proceed with it, but I venture to hope that most of the information which he seeks will be found in the

<col>115</col>
Return for which I have asked. I hope your Lordships will agree to this Return on the ground that it will furnish a good deal of information which at present can only be obtained at considerable labour, and perhaps not then quite correctly, by individual members of your Lordships' House. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00438"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to make a few remarks on one point of detail. I quite understand that in view of the pressure of time it is not possible now to alter this Return, but at the same time I think the public should understand that the Return is in itself defective. To begin with, it is purely official. It only records the names of those members of your Lordships' House who have been in the service of the Crown,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0084"/>
<col>117</col>
and even there Lords-Lieutenant of counties are omitted. Moreover, a considerable number of members of your Lordships' House have occupied positions, which, though not in the service of the Crown, were of considerable national importance, such as Chancellors of Universities, Governors of the Bank of England, Presidents of the Royal Society, and so on. I might instance the case of the late Lord Kelvin, who occupied a position of great national importance and was peculiarly fitted to advise your Lordships' House on many important matters, and yet his name, unless he was a Privy Councillor, would not have appeared on this Return. I think, therefore, that it ought to be clearly understood by the public that the Return is not a complete one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00439"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BYRON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust that your Lordships will permit me to say a word on a subject in which I am afraid I have a considerable interest. I cannot count myself among those enrolled in the first part of the noble Earl's Return, but I think there may be a good deal to be said with regard to the second part, in which I must unfortunately include myself. Should this Return be forthcoming, and should it be shown that there is a number of Peers whose attendance had been rather slack, I venture to think it would be not only useless, but to a great extent misleading, unless we could have tabulated the reasons for which those noble Lords had been absent. For instance, there might be cases&#x2014;my own is one&#x2014;of prolonged illness, and the question of a medical certificate or something of that kind to show that a Peer had been ill for a long time, ought, I think, to be taken into consideration. I do not, of course, venture to move the rejection of this Return, but I trust that noble Lords will take into consideration all matters that have caused Peers to be periodically absent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00440"><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to hope that in any Return which your Lordships may grant you will not follow the advice of my noble friend behind me and tabulate our sins, or supposed sins, in the way suggested. I did not rise to make a speech, but only to make one observation and to ask a question. I should like heartily to associate myself with the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer. I think it is obvious, if the selection of Lords of Parliament is to be settled by qualification, that
<col>118</col>
there must be and are many members in your Lordships' House who have done great service to the State, though not under the Crown; and it would be very valuable, if this is to be the foundation of any action on the part of this House, that those members should be included as well as noble Lords who have served the Sovereign. The question I wish to ask is why the noble Earl has chosen the three special years 1902, 1906, and 1909. There may be good reason for that. I should like to hear from the noble Earl why those three years have been specially chosen as the foundation for a Return of the attendances of Temporal Peers in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00441"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to interrupt the course of the discussion, but I should like to ask whether those Peers who are not included in this Return are to be known under the general description of "wild men?"</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00442"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no desire to offer any kind of opposition to this Return, or indeed to any Return of a similar character for which any noble Lord may ask, provided that it can be produced without too great a charge on the public funds. But from the few observations which have been made by noble Lords in different parts of the House it is impossible not to conclude that a certain difficulty which surrounds the whole matter also surrounds this Return. That is to say, if certain inferences are to be drawn from a particular Return with a view to influencing the House towards the adoption of a particular policy we may look, I think, for a demand for something like a torrent of different Returns, all intended to enforce the different points of view&#x2014;and I believe they are extremely numerous&#x2014;held by noble Lords on this subject. I think it is necessary, therefore, and I have no doubt the noble Earl who moved for the Return will agree in this, that the Return must be taken as simply stating certain things, and that it must not be treated as an argument in itself for any particular line of policy which the noble Earl or any other noble Lord may desire to adopt. In such conditions I confess I have no desire whatever to oppose its production.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00443"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may, with the permission of the House, reply to the question as to why the special years 1902, 1906, and 1909 were selected. The answer is that the Return is practically prepared. I have copies in my hand. They are marked "Confidential" because the Return was prepared for the Committee presided over by Lord Rosebery. Those particular years were then selected, and I have asked to have the Return reprinted for the information of your Lordships' House generally.</membercontribution></p>

I think, however, that the noble Earl's Return is still inadequate if it is to be the basis of any recommendations subsequently brought before your Lordships' House for approval. But in the amended form of the noble Earl's Return I do not think the information for which I ask is necessary, and therefore, with your Lordships' leave, I will not move my Motion.</p>

Your Lordships may recollect that last year a Joint Committee of both Houses was appointed to consider the condition of the business in the King's Bench Division. That Committee sat and made the unanimous recommendation that two fresh Judges of the King's Bench Division should for the time be appointed, but they did not recommend that the additional Judges should be permanent unless, after further experience, Parliament should so decide. That was not exactly my view, because I thought Commissioners would suffice, but I thoroughly and loyally accept the preference expressed by the Joint Committee, and this Bill is brought in for the purpose of carrying out literally the recommendation I have read to your Lordships. There is one other part of the Joint Committee's Report, to my mind very valuable, relating to other recommendations for the improvement of business in that Division. I should have liked to include that in this Bill, but the Committee thought the appointment of the Judges ought to be proceeded with at once. I

cannot conceal from myself that some of the other part of the Report may be controversial, and I wish to confine myself at the moment to the non-controversial proposals.

Questions F, G, and H relate to a particular matter that has been brought to my notice by those who are eminently qualified to form an opinion on the subject. I am quite aware that under the Regulations it is necessary that recruits should fire a certain number of rounds of ball cartridge in addition to those of miniature ammunition through Morris tube. But information has reached me from a very direct source&#x2014;and I should like my noble friend, if he has any doubt on the subject, to satisfy himself as to the accuracy of the statement&#x2014;that there are a large number of men who have never fired any ball cartridge at all. That seems to me to be a rather serious matter when upon that you base efficiency in musketry training. For that reason I think considerable importance attaches to the reply of my noble friend to Questions F, G, and H. As regards Question D, I do not know whether my noble friend will be able to give me the figures up to January 1 last, but supposing he cannot give them beyond October 1, which was the end of the old Volunteer year, I hope he will allow me on some subsequent date to put a further Question to him, if necessary, to elicit information on that point. I beg to put the Questions standing in my name on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00489"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the noble Earl's first Question is that the establishment of the Territorial Force is 11,218 officers, 36,140 non-commissioned officers, and 265,132 men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00490"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: Do those figures include any of the officers of the Training Corps?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00491"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The figures do not include the officers of the Training Corps. It is quite true that those officers hold
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0088"/>
<col>125</col>
Territorial commissions, but they are altogether outside the organisation of the Territorial Force, and we do not, therefore, include them. With regard to strength, the returns in the form we have them do not separate the non-commissioned officers from the men. Of officers there are 9,701 excluding 741 officers for general hospitals and sanitary service (who are only available on mobilisation) and 840 officers of the Officers' Training Corps and on the unattached list; and there are 262,036 non-commissioned officers and men. As to Question C, officers do not serve on a definite agreement, and therefore I cannot give any figures regarding that. Of the non-commissioned officers and men serving October 1, 1909, 65,000, roughly, were due to complete their engagement before July 1, 1910. The figures for January 1, 1910, would only be slightly different from those for October. To have obtained the figures up to January would have necessitated our calling for special returns, and would have involved a great deal of trouble and clerical work. I therefore hope the noble Earl will accept the figures for October in place of those for which he has asked. Similarly, with regard to Question D, I can only give the figures on October 1, 1909. On that date 98,306 non-commissioned officers and men out of the total strength of upwards of 260,000 were under twenty years of age. As to Question E, the form in which our returns are called for is this. We ask for returns in three forms&#x2014;namely, men who have attended for eight days and under fifteen, those who have attended for fifteen days, and those who have attended for over fifteen days. There are a certain number of men, not a very large number, who do attend camp for over eight and under fifteen days, but it is impossible to calculate the average. As a matter of fact the total numbers who attended camp last year were 8,181 officers and 240,056 of other ranks, and out of these 6,866 officers and 163,045 of other ranks attended fifteen days or over.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00492"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble Lord give the other categories?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00493"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I have not got with me the number who attended for over fifteen days. The number was very small, and I grouped them in the figures with those who attended for fifteen days. If the noble Marquess desires I could get the number.</membercontribution></p>
<col>126</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00494"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Did the noble Lord say that over 160,000 had attended for fifteen days?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00495"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes; the number who attended for fifteen days or over was 163,045. Then with regard to Question F, the noble Earl has the advantage of me because I am not aware that the firing by recruits of twenty-three rounds of miniature ammunition on indoor miniature ranges has been at all widespread. It is the case that certain units have not been able to carry out their musketry entirely, but we do not recognise the firing of twenty-three rounds on a miniature range as sufficient to qualify a recruit in musketry. The recruit's course laid down in the Musketry Regulations is that he should pass through, normally, an instructional course of forty rounds on an open range and a qualification standard of twenty rounds also on open range. Of course, if a man can pass the qualification standard straight away he does not have to go through the instructional course, as it means that his musketry is up to a satisfactory standard as regards recruits. But, if he does not go through that, what we lay down is that he shall fire fifty rounds on an open range, and if he does not fire the whole of his fifty rounds on an open range he shall have fired not less than twenty, and shall have fired the rest or the equivalent in miniature ammunition on a miniature range or on a thirty-yards range with service ammunition. As I say, the firing of twenty-three rounds of miniature ammunition is not a standard which we recognise in any way at all. I cannot, therefore, answer Question G, which asks how many have passed this particular standard. In reply to the noble Earl's last question, I am unable to state how many men have not fired a service rifle with service ammunition on an open-air range&#x2014;we have not yet had the musketry returns from Hythe&#x2014;but I know there have been seven units of the Territorial Force, seven battalions of Infantry, who have not been able to fire a single shot at an open range at all, and there have been ten other units of whom not more than fifty per cent. have been tested in musketry on an open range. All those cases are due to the fact that there is not sufficient range accommodation and that those units either were not able to get to a range at all or got there with such difficulty that only a certain number of their men
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0089"/>
<col>127</col>
were able to fire. As noble Lords know, range accommodation in this country is, I am sorry to say, still inadequate. We are doing our best, and a considerable amount of money is being expended in the provision of fresh ranges. What we are doing first is to provide ranges for those units which have not had accommodation up to the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00496"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble Lord say if those men who have not fired on an open-air range at all this year are returned as efficient?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00497"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I quite appreciate the point of the noble Duke's question. The term "efficient," in the sense in which it is used in this connection, is perhaps an unfortunate expression, and it is quite possible we may have to change it. What is meant, in this particular context, by the word "efficient" is that the man has qualified, has been to an open range and has been through his musketry and is therefore qualified for the grant which will be made for him to the Association. As long as we have ground for knowing that the man has done musketry and has endeavoured to make himself a good shot we regard that as qualifying him for earning a grant for his Association.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00498"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Do I gather from what the noble Lord has said that a recruit once qualified goes to the range no more, and yet always remains efficient?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00503"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: We have made a special exception in their case. Of course, it is impossible to make those men efficient and enable their Associations to earn the grant. But that is a temporary circumstance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00506"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Is it not the fact that an "efficient" soldier need not have hit the target at all?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00507"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: He need not have let off his gun at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00508"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: That is so, if he gets a special exemption from the General. But without such special exemption a man can be an efficient soldier who has not hit the target at all. It is laid down by Memorandum No. 111 that an efficient soldier, as regards musketry, is a soldier of the Territorial Force who has either reached the qualification stage or&#x2014;
<quote>"is certified by his commanding officer to have made at least three visits, including the tests, to an open miniature range and fired at least fifty rounds of ammunition."</quote>
That is to say, if this Circular has not been withdrawn it does not go any higher than this, that a commanding officer is able to give a certificate of efficiency and the General has nothing further to do with the matter. It is surely a very serious thing that the whole of the Territorial Force can qualify by shooting at these miniature ranges. This fact, coupled with the fact that only 163,000 out of the whole Territorial Force have been out for fifteen days training, shows that the Territorial Force is worse trained than even its severest critics in this House have ever maintained. I think this discussion comes very opportunely after the three solid hours of optimism in regard to the defence of the country to which the other House was treated on Monday last.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00509"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble Lord tell us in what parts of the country those battalions are situated which have been unable to find open-air range accommodation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00510"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I think most of them are in the North of England&#x2014;in Lancashire and Yorkshire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00511"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I think I can answer the noble Viscount's question. Glasgow is the place where none of the men have shot their course. In East Lancashire there are some 3,000 men who have not
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0090"/>
<col>129</col>
shot their course. In London, I believe, certain Generals have absolutely declined to say that the men are efficient. I have a letter from one battalion officer who says, "None of my battalion is efficient except Major Blank and myself, because the Regulation states that musketry is optional for field officers."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00512"><member>VISCOUNT MEDLETON</member><membercontribution>: If Lord Lovat is correct in saying that in London there is a difficulty in finding open-air ranges, could not the Government give the London battalions facilities for shooting on their ranges at Bisley? To call men "efficient" who have never shot at an open-air range does seem to be straining the word. I certainly think, if it is the case that some of the London battalions have found a difficulty in getting accommodation, Government targets should be placed at their disposal for a certain number of days in the year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00513"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: It is true that there has been a difficulty with regard to the musketry of the London units. The difficulty, however, does not arise to any great extent in London as there are open-air ranges within reach, and when the new Purfleet range in Essex is opened that will give further accommodation. What has caused the difficulty to a great extent is that the new musketry course is in many ways much more exacting than the old. The men have to go to the ranges more frequently, and, in consequence, it is difficult to find accommodation for them all. Considering the newness of the course and the fact that it has created a great deal of congestion on the ranges I think we have got through the year very well indeed, and the difficulties that we have experienced during the first year are in a fair way to being removed during the current year. May I say one word about the point raised by Lord Lovat as to a man being passed as an efficient soldier who has not managed to hit the target at all? The whole of this scheme of musketry, which was drawn up with considerable care by the greatest experts, was very largely devised with the object of enabling bad shots to become good shots. In the new scheme there is a great deal more elasticity in regard to the use of the rounds of ammunition than under the old. Ninety rounds are allowed per man, and the commanding officer is empowered to use some of the rounds of men who are good shots in
<col>130</col>
coaching up the pool shots. It has been on found that this system has to a great extent done away with the bad shots and levelled up the general shooting of each unit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00514"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I admit that the present system of musketry instruction is a great improvement on the old. The technical part is absolutely right. What I take exception to is the neglect of the War Office in not insisting upon that good system being carried out. You have this most unfortunate paragraph in Memorandum No. 111 which says that Territorial soldiers need not pass this standard. In the old days unless they got to what was called Class 3 you could not draw the grants for them when they came to camp. Now you can draw their grants and call them efficient if they have simply gone to the range three times and fired off fifty rounds of ball cartridge, although they may have missed the target every time.</membercontribution></p>

His Majesty's Government will issue regulations to secure that all members of the staff of Inland Revenue Surveyors of Taxes shall be permanent Civil servants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00516"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have made inquiries at the Inland Revenue, and the answers to the noble Earl's Questions are as follow. Of the clerks employed in the offices of Surveyors of Taxes thirty per cent. are established Civil servants and seventy per cent. are engaged under agreements terminable at a week's notice. All the clerks are sworn to secrecy. Only the established clerks are engaged upon responsible and confidential duties, the work of the non-established

clerks being of a routine character. Then the noble Earl asks whether there is any intention of enlarging the staff. Of course, as the work grows heavier the staff has to be enlarged, and it may have to be again enlarged from time to time. In reply to the question whether, having regard to the confidential nature of the work done by such clerks, His Majesty's Government will issue regulations to secure that all members of the staff of Inland Revenue Surveyors of Taxes shall be permanent Civil servants, we are of opinion that, in view of the fact that the work of the unestablished clerks appears to be mainly&#x2014;I think entirely&#x2014;of a routine character, no need arises for the adoption of the course which the noble Earl suggests.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00537"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships were good enough last session to accede to my Motion to appoint a Select Committee to consider and report upon the Standing Orders relating to Standing Committees, and the noble Lords named of the Committee in the Motion now standing in my name on the Paper were appointed as members of that Committee. Early in the session some of the members of the Committee found it inconvenient to attend, and other circumstances occurred so that the Committee never met. But I now ask your Lordships to reappoint the Committee, and I propose, if my Motion is agreed to, to call the Committee together as soon as convenient. The names which appear on your Lordships' Paper are, as I have said, the same names as appeared last year. I propose, however, to add the name of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, but in

<title>REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00559"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member> had given notice to move, That the House do resolve itself into a Committee to consider the best means of reforming its existing organisation, so as to constitute a strong and efficient Second Chamber; and, in the event of such Motion being agreed to, to move the following Resolutions:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. That a strong and efficient Second Chamber is not merely an integral part of the British Constitution, but is necessary to the well-being of the State and to the balance of Parliament.</li>
<li>2. That such a Chamber can best be obtained by the reform and reconstitution of the House of Lords.</li>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0096"/>
<col>141</col>
<li>3. That a necessary preliminary of such reform and reconstitution is the acceptance of the principle that the possession of a Peerage should no longer of itself give the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00560">The noble Earl said: My Lords, it is two and twenty years almost to a day since I last brought the subject of the reform of your Lordships' House before you. I then thought that that would be the last occasion on which I should trouble you, because I then recognised that some motive power external to this House would be required before this House was likely to take that matter into its serious consideration. But now it has seemed better when, by a large concurrence of opinion, it is felt that measures should be taken inside this House for the reform of this House&#x2014;it has seemed better that the proposals should come from the Cross Benches, from some neutral source, so as to be rather the work of the House itself than to appear to be the action of the House dictated or controlled or inspired by that Front Bench which is usually believed to lead the opinion of this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00561">My Lords, there has long been a body of opinion in this House that has been profoundly conscious of some imperfections in its structure, which it would be well in the interest of this House to remove without delay. We have been conscious, I think, in the first place, that we are too numerous a body for effective work; secondly, that we represent too much one interest, though, perhaps, that point of view has been somewhat exaggerated; and thirdly, that the principle of heredity, which is now the basis of our Constitution, has met with increasing criticism and objection in the great body of the nation. My Lords, I hope that while we are all conscious of these imperfections we are also conscious of the great and splendid history and traditions of this House. I am the last, I hope, in this Assembly to attempt in any degree to disparage them. No one can look at the history of this House without recalling the long list of illustrious men who have sat in it, and who are sitting in it, and without seeing that in every century and age of this Kingdom it has attracted to it perhaps the majority of all the military and political ability of this country, and of late, also, a large proportion of scientific and literary eminence. More than that, its antiquity is a fact which I think very few even of your Lordships realise, and certainly
<col>142</col>
very few of your critics. It is claimed by Professor Freeman, not merely a great historian but a still greater Radical&#x2014;for the name of Liberal he would have spurned&#x2014;that this House is the lineal descendant and representative of the Saxon Witenagemote, and so illustrious a descent as this, prolonged through so many ages, is not a fact which any member of your Lordships' House, or any critic of your Lordships' House, can altogether afford to disregard.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00562">There have been eulogies passed upon this House in terms more eloquent than any that I can use, one of which, at any rate, though I know how distasteful is an extract to an audience, I will venture to inflict on your Lordships:&#x2014;
<quote>"Remember for one moment what the House of Lords is. It is an integral part of the Constitution of England. It holds a large place in English history. Most of the present holders of titles in the House of Lords are the descendants of the men who wrung the Charter from John on the plains of Runnymede."</quote>
My Lords, I confess that I think that is an overstatement, and if any of my brethren in this House make that claim I desire to make a respectful exception as regards myself from any such assumption&#x2014;
<quote>"They are the descendants of men who in the past history of Britain fought the battles of England against the world, and I say that to abolish that portion of the Constitution, which is older probably in point of antiquity, in point of history, than the House of Commons itself&#x2014;to abolish that means a revolution greater than any that has taken place in the whole constitutional history of England."</quote>
Those are the words not merely of a public speaker of great power but of a person of great political importance. They are the words not of an old fossilised Tory embedded in this House: they are the eloquent phrases of Mr. Redmond. They were delivered to an enthusiastic audience of his countrymen in the Rotunda at Dublin some fifteen or sixteen years ago, and though I am not in favour of disinterring old speeches, I do not think it out of place to recall this important extract as coming from one who at this moment is attempting, and not without success, to disturb the arrangements of the whole financial administration of the country entirely with a view to bringing about the abolition of the House of Lords. There is another point with regard to this extract which I should like noble Lords opposite to remember. It is that the enterprise on which he is engaged involves a greater revolution than any that has yet occurred
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0097"/>
<col>143</col>
in the history of England. What I want you to consider is that Mr. Redmond knows what he is doing and where he is going, and I think that there are a good many on the Ministerial side of the House who do not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00563">Now, my Lords, I ventured to say that I thought when I last spoke on this subject that some external pressure would be required to bring the House of Lords actively to bestir itself in the work of its own reform. In saying that I mean no censure. It is obviously difficult for any body of men to bring themselves to disturb a state of things which, though not wholly satisfactory, is generally comfortable. <i>Quieta non movere</i> is a great axiom of all lives, general and particular, and when in addition you are required to concede some part, at any rate, of your privileges it is, in my judgment, quite natural that the House of Lords should require some pressure to reform itself. But even if that pressure has come from without, this House in acceding to the movement is not acting under pressure, but is acting on the spontaneous results of its own action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00564">There have been various attempts within this House to reform this House. I will not go so far back as the almost pre-historic attempts of the third Earl Grey, Lord Russell, and the late Lord Salisbury, but among living men there are two who have moved in the matter, Lord Dunraven and Lord Newton. Lord Newton, alone of all the House of Lords' reformers, was able to bring his movement to a successful issue. He at last succeeded in bringing about the appointment of a Committee to consider the reforms that might be advisable in this House, and so far he has gathered the only sheaf in this somewhat barren harvest. I lay emphasis on Lord Newton's Committee&#x2014;to which I shall have to return for a moment&#x2014;for this reason, that it brought in a detailed Report to your Lordships before the present agitation began, and though no action was taken upon it in this House the reason was perfectly evident that there was no use taking action without the co-operation of the House of Commons, and that, of course, from the nature of things, could not be hoped for from the present Government. I am not blaming the present Government; I am only stating the facts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00565">Well, then, we come to the very important external pressure which has come upon us as a result of the General Election. The General Election, as has already been
<col>144</col>
remarked, has this unique and remarkable result, that it disappointed every Party who engaged in it, and I am not quite sure that it is not for the benefit of the country as a whole that that result was obtained. But it is only as a philosopher and an onlooker that I make that remark. There was, however, one direct and positive result that this House cannot afford to overlook. There was returned a majority of 125 to the House of Commons violently and radically opposed to the existence, at any rate, of the prerogatives of this House. Even that majority requires some analysis. It is in the main made up of the Irish Party and the Labour Party. Now the Irish Party desires the abolition of the House of Lords, avowedly and declaredly in order to get rid of the last obstacle to what is known as Home Rule. After that obstacle is removed they will presumably remove to Dublin, and in all probability trouble themselves no more with our constitutional arrangements. Therefore, the majority against this House, so far as it is composed of the Irish Party, is one merely for a temporary object, and that an object to which the majority of the people of England have repeatedly shown that they are diametrically opposed. Then I come to the Labour Party. The Labour Party have no such temporary object. Their objects are much too permanent. They aim at the destruction of the House of Lords for the purpose of advancing various sweeping schemes, the nationalisation of this and the nationalisation of that, for which at present the population of Great Britain, so far as I know, has shown no marked desire, and therefore they also must be considered, with some deduction as regards their operations, against the House of Lords.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00566">I am bound to say there are other elements in that majority which I regard more seriously in reality than either of those which I have indicated. There are the Scotch. Now, my Lords, I cannot flatter your Lordships by saying that the objection of the Scotch to the hereditary constitution of this Chamber is ever likely to be removed. Strangely enough, it is an hereditary objection to an hereditary principle. It is born in their bone and their blood and their flesh. It has come to them from a century back. I remember Mr. Gladstone telling me that, when he was a young man travelling south from his father's house to London, at the time of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0098"/>
<col>145</col>
the great Reform Bill of 1832, he passed through Dundee and saw two placards which made his blood run cold. I have absolutely forgotten one, but I think I shall never forget the other. The other was simply this:&#x2014;"To hell with the bloody tyrants!" And you, my Lords, or rather your predecessors, were the bloody tyrants in question. Very much the same sort of language is used now. I have sometimes wished that the people who use it could be brought by excursion train to the Palace of Westminster and invited to inspect this House on an ordinary working day, for anything less like a committee of "bloody tyrants" than the somewhat apathetic and sometimes somnolent, but always highly respectable body of men than those you see on these red benches I cannot, for the life of me, conceive. I say, then, that from Scotland, and from the north of England I think&#x2014;of Scotland I am sure&#x2014;you have an objection which you will never be able to mollify or break down in regard to the hereditary constitution of this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00567">But, my Lords, there is much more than the mere fact of the General Election. There is the fact that the Government, both in the King's Speech and in a speech which, without disparagement to that gracious document, I consider is more important than any King's Speech, have submitted a plan which, I suppose, they have formulated in detail in private; a plan, first for the disabling of the powers of the House of Lords, and secondly at some remote period for its reconstitution. My Lords, I must ask you to follow me while I investigate the proposals and the plan of the Government, so far as that plan is known to us, for that is the necessary alternative to any plan that you may submit to the country. I do not wish to make any attack on the Government. I can conceive nothing more easy for a competent orator than to make a very rattling speech against the Government at this moment, with extracts from their speeches, and the windings of their policy, not without noticing in passing those financial measures of strategy which seem, to the casual onlooker, more subtle than beautiful. But that is not my object to-night. My object is not in the least in the world polemic. I only want to consider, from a practical point of view, what is the policy of His Majesty's Government with
<col>146</col>
regard to this House. The first notice we had of it was in the King's Speech.
<quote>"Proposals will be laid before you&#x2014;</quote>
were the words put into His Majesty's mouth&#x2014;
<quote>"with all convenient speed, to define the relations between the Houses of Parliament, so as to secure the undivided authority of the House of Commons over finance, and its predominance in legislation. These measures, in the opinion of my advisers, should provide that this House"&#x2014;[this undefined House]&#x2014;" should be so constituted and empowered as to exercise impartially, in regard to proposed legislation, the functions of initiation, revision, and, subject to proper safeguards, of delay."</quote>
Those words were sufficiently vague, but, through their lofty and somewhat foggy grammar, we seem to perceive a distinct intention that two parallel measures will be introduced into Parliament, one for the limitation of the prerogatives of the House of Lords, and the other for its reconstitution on a different basis. The week after we had more precise information from the Prime Minister. Immediately on the assembling of the House on February 28 he said&#x2014;
<quote>"Subject, of course, always to unforeseen exigencies, we shall present our proposals with regard to the relations between the two Houses, and present them in the first instance, as I have already intimated, in the form of Resolutions. Those Resolutions will, I hope and believe, be both few and simple. They will affirm&#x2014;I am speaking now in general terms&#x2014;the necessity for excluding the House of Lords altogether from the domain of finance. They will ask this House to declare that in the sphere of legislation the power of Veto at present possessed by the House of Lords shall be so limited in its exercise as to secure the predominance of the deliberate and considered will of the House of Commons within the lifetime of a single Parliament."</quote>
To which has since been added the fact that Parliament is to be a shortened Parliament.
<quote>"Further, it will be made plain that these constitutional changes are without prejudice to and contemplate in a subsequent year the substitution in our Second Chamber of a democratic for an aristocratic basis."</quote>
In fact, my Lords, what is foreshadowed is our old friend the Campbell-Bannerman Resolution followed at some distant day, which is not indicated, and need not be indicated, by a plan for the reconstitution of this House on a different basis. My Lords, that plan will not follow the passing of the Veto Resolutions by the House of Commons. I am not now speaking of the question as to whether next year or in any subsequent year His Majesty's
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0099"/>
<col>147</col>
Ministers will be in possession of Downing-street. That is not the point that I wish to labour.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00568">What I want to point out is that it is absolutely and practically out of the question that, when they have passed their Resolutions, if they ever do pass them, they should be followed at any subsequent day by the plan. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, in the course of the General Election, made some very strong declarations in favour of an efficient Second Chamber to be maintained on an elective basis. Those who read those declarations were glad to see that in any case there was to be an effective Second Chamber, but surely Sir Edward Grey and those who think with him must see that all prospect of their pledges or declarations being carried out is absolutely removed by the declaration of the Prime Minister this day fortnight. If the proposals are not to be parallel, if they are not to be <i>pari passu</i>, they must know perfectly well that they will never come to fruition. I am perfectly certain that my right hon. friends Mr. Asquith and Sir Edward Grey and their colleagues are speaking and acting in perfect good faith, but the sons of Zeruiah will be too hard for them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00569">Just sketch out in your own mind what the prospects of the Liberal Party and of Ministers will be as sketched out by the Prime Minister. Suppose his own programme carried out. Suppose he carries the Resolutions of which I have just read the description to your Lordships. He will come back next year or in "some subsequent year"&#x2014;I quote his own language&#x2014;to his Party and will say to them:&#x2014;"Now we have carried our proposals for the abolition of the Veto, it is time for us to consider the reconstitution and reform of the House of Lords." What will his Party say to him? They will say, "We are very much obliged to you, we are exceedingly grateful, we recognise your good intentions, but we do not mean to have anything whatever to do with it. You have done all we wanted. You have deprived the House of Lords of all privileges, of all powers, of its Veto "&#x2014;as it is called, which is its right of concurrent legislation&#x2014;" you have absolutely deprived them of it in the course of a single and shortened Parliament; what more do we want? You have brought the House of Lords to its marrow bones, you have bled it to death, you have reduced it to a
<col>148</col>
moribund condition. We rejoice, you can hear our <i>Te Deum</i>, but do you think that we are such unutterable and doddering idiots as to restore what we have just been at so much pains to destroy?" I have the greatest opinion of the good sense of the Radical Party in the other House of Parliament, of the extreme wing of the Liberal Party, and I am as certain as though I heard the dialogue going on that, supposing the Veto Resolutions of the Prime Minister are carried out, that is what would result from the interview between the Prime Minister and his followers. And indeed would it be worth while for the Prime Minister or for the Liberal Party or for any one else, to set up the House of Lords when they had removed all its powers? Was there ever, if I may use the adjective with all courtesy, so preposterous a proposal offered to either House of Parliament?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00570">I am induced for once to agree with the sons of Zeruiah, whom I do not propose to particularise at this moment. You may choose, if you are in the position of the Government, logically between two lines and only two lines. You can either reform the House of Lords and place it on what you consider a better and a more democratic basis, or you can deprive it of all its powers&#x2014;that is the proposal of the Government&#x2014;and leave it alone, but to combine the two proposals does seem to me one of the most remarkable instances of illogical proposition that has ever been submitted, as I say, to the public. When you have annulled and shattered and bled to death this Chamber, you then propose, at some moment of your leisure, to put it up again&#x2014;I do not like to use any irreverent comparison&#x2014;like that game of Aunt Sally, in which we were wont to spend the leisure hours of our youth. But I will give your Lordships another illustration which, I think, is more close, and which may appeal to that sporting section of your Lordships' House to which so many of us belong. Supposing one of us possessed a valuable horse to-day. According to the Government plan we ham-string it, we put an end to its power of motion, its power of volition, but at the same time we announce that next year or on some future occasion we propose to start it for the Derby. That is, so far as I can gather, the exact proposal that His Majesty's Government propose to submit to this House.</p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0100"/>
<col>149</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00571">Now, my Lords, there is one ominous word in the Speech from the Throne and the speech of the Prime Minister, which is the word "predominant"&#x2014;the word "predominant" in legislation as between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. My contention is&#x2014;and I know my noble friend the Secretary of State for India who is going to follow me is a great authority, and I would ask his attention to this point&#x2014;that the word predominant in that sense is absolutely unknown to the British Constitution, and in the second place that it implies without any further explanation the existence of an uncontrolled single Chamber. The predominance is to be established by three simple processes. I do not think it necessary to recall now what they are. In the Campbell-Bannerman Resolution, so far as I recollect, after a Bill had been read three times in three successive years in the House of Commons, and after a conference of the two Houses, it was to become law. In the picturesque words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Government, with this Bill in its hands, was to go straight to the Throne without any interference from any other body of men. If that is not single-Chamber government I do not know what is. I am not alone in that judgment, which, after all, must be the judgment of every unprejudiced person. I have a very important authority on my side who has lately written a letter to the papers&#x2014;I mean Lord Marchamley. Lord Marchamley has written to say with regard to the Campbell-Bannerman Resolution that&#x2014;
<quote>"although I was a member of the House of Commons at the time I never liked that Resolution. It would practically abolish two-Chamber government. It would decree the sole domination of the House of Commons."</quote>
The noble Lord is too modest when he says he was only a member of the House of Commons at the time. He was one of the most important members of the House of Commons. He was Chief Whip. As Chief Whip he was the principal strategist of the Liberal Party, and kept the conscience of the Liberal Party. We now know that all the time this Resolution was being formulated by the Government and adopted by the House of Commons amid the loud acclamations of that Assembly, the Chief Whip, nourishing, like Cleopatra, an asp at his vitals, had an uneasy conscience that what he was approving was in reality most deleterious, as it would establish
<col>150</col>
single-Chamber government, which, of course, all history tells us is pestilential to the country which adopts it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00572">But I would also point out that if our powers would have gone under that Resolution and if our powers will certainly go under the Resolutions to be proposed by the Prime Minister, our very existence will be at the absolute mercy of the House of Commons whenever they choose to put an end to us. What is there to prevent the House of Commons at any moment embodying in a Bill the famous Resolution of February 6, 1649, which runs as follows:
<quote>"Resolved, that the House of Peers in Parliament is useless, dangerous, and ought to be abolished, and that an Act be brought in for that purpose."</quote>
That was done. I am not at all sure, if that Resolution had been proposed to the last House of Commons, that it would not have been carried by an overwhelming majority. What prevented it being carried into effect was this, that the powers of the House of Lords were still in existence and would have impeded the action of the House of Commons, so that it was not worth while to pass it, but under the Campbell-Bannerman <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> it could be done after being read three times without the consent of your Lordships' House. So our emasculated institution would then disappear, "unwept, unhonoured, and unsung;" and I for one should not shed a tear for its disappearance if it ever reached such a condition as that to which His Majesty's Government propose to reduce it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00573">What followed the Resolution of February, 1649? The very next day the House of Commons passed this Resolution:&#x2014;
<quote>"Resolved, that it has been found by experience, and this House doth declare, that the office of King in this nation, and to have the power thereof in any single person, is unnecessary, burdensome, and dangerous to the liberty, the safety, and the public interests of this nation, and therefore ought to be abolished."</quote>
And an Act to this effect was brought in and passed. Well, it was brought in and passed. I do not in the least pretend that I anticipate as the result of the passing of the Resolution of which the Government have given notice any immediate or direct danger to the Throne, but it is important for any student of history to consider what was the direct sequence of events at that time, and to remember that when a body once abolishes one branch of the Legislature it might find
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0101"/>
<col>151</col>
it desirable to try that sort of operation again, eager to deal with some other object and that the Throne itself, without anybody to intervene between it and the Commons, would be at any rate in a precarious position. I am not speaking on my own authority, or from conclusions I may draw from history. Let me appeal to the greatest Sovereign who ever reigned in this country without the name of King. I mean Oliver Cromwell. In the last speech he addressed to his Parliament in the very year in which he died he made use of the following remarkable expression:&#x2014;
<quote>"I tell you of one thing. I made it a condition&#x2014;that is, for taking the supreme power&#x2014;that I would not undertake it without there might be some other body to interpose between you and me on behalf of the Commonwealth to prevent the tumultuary and popular spirit. You granted that I should name another House, and I named it. With integrity I did it."</quote>
That was the speech of the Sovereign who possessed far more power in this country than any Sovereign since his time and most before, and he said after an experience of five or six years that he for one would not undertake to sit upon what was virtually the Throne of this country without a House of Lords, without a Second Chamber to intervene between him and the tumultuary spirit of the people and of the Commons at large.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00574">But what followed this double abolition carried out in forty-eight hours? In a few years Cromwell was trying, with an eagerness almost pathetic, to restore the House of Lords, which with great difficulty, and in a very imperfect shape, he was able to do, and simultaneously with his attempt to restore the House of Lords the House of Commons, almost on its knees, was begging him to restore the Monarchy which it abolished eight years before. And, of course, as we all know, eleven years after the abolition of these branches of the Legislature was carried they were restored by acclamation unaltered as they were before the great revolution. Speaking of Cromwell, I should like to say in passing that the Government, if they wished for it, will get no encouragement from him for the arrangement they propose. He who had fought against the King on behalf of liberty called it "the horridest arbitrariness that ever was known in the world." That is what he called government by single Chamber, and that is what the Government are about to propose to us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00575">What is the policy of the Government in a word? It consists of a Resolution
<col>152</col>
declaring the complete domination of the House of Commons, and placing the existence of the House of Lords at the hazard of the whim or momentary mood of the House of Commons. Then some day they propose to establish a precarious, muzzled, impotent phantom of a Second Chamber. They propose to do so, and I think I have shown conclusively they will never do so; but if they do it, let me suggest one difficulty to them. Of whom would this House be composed? What self-respecting person would sit in this House who could sit in the most ordinary vestry in any country parish? Of whom would this House of puppets and cripples be composed? We see from the King's Speech that the Government are in some difficulty as to the name which they shall bestow on this legislative body. Let me assist them in that. There is in this Palace an apartment well known to historians as the Painted Chamber. Let the Government, if they ever form their Chamber call it the Painted Chamber, for it will be no more. If they like they may sketch in frescoes on the wall the image of the respectable and sagacious people who would represent the House which they have in their mind's eye. Or if they want something a little more material than a mere fresco&#x2014;I do not think they would&#x2014;it would be more convenient to walk straight through to the steps of the Throne, through a Chamber such as that, unembarrassed by any figures in it. But if they desire some more visible embodiment, they might go to the friend of our childhood, Madame Tussaud, and ask for some of her waxen images, dressed up in the robes which Peers are supposed habitually to wear, and they would form a very suitable Chamber for the advancement of His Majesty's Government's enterprises. And if they wanted something that could articulate they might easily get a division of the A Police or a couple of well-drilled companies of Guards and they would fulfil all the functions that His Majesty's Government require for a Second Chamber.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00576">With a single Chamber people, at least, know where they are. They know whom they are voting for. They know where to place responsibility of Acts and of Law. But a Second Chamber that is but a sham of a Second Chamber, that will be without a shadow of responsibility and power, that is to act as a whipping-boy, where necessary, for the failures of the House of Commons, is a dangerous and a futile
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0102"/>
<col>153</col>
hypocrisy. The worst thing you can do with an ancient and illustrious House like this is first to degrade and disable it, and then to try and keep it in apparent existence for the purpose of deception. I am as confident of this as I am that I stand here. When you had carried your measure, when you had got rid of the House of Lords, when you had substituted for it your ghosts and phantoms, there would very soon be a violent reaction and a loud and almost universal demand from the country for the establishment of a stronger Second Chamber than exists at present. Meanwhile, there is to be an interval&#x2014;a very considerable interval&#x2014;between the revision of our powers and the reconstitution of the Second Chamber. Mr. Balfour in the House of Commons made a very clever gibe, as I thought, at the Government, in which he pointed out that the interval between the destruction of our powers and the reconstitution of the Second Chamber might possibly be done intentionally, with a view of carrying a Home Rule Bill in that interval. That, of course, was only a gibe, but it was a very amusing one. At any rate, there would be a very considerable interval, and even if it were not for the purpose of carrying a Home Rule Bill, the whole country and all its interests would be at the mercy of any chance majority, of any sudden ebullition of momentary wrath, such as swept over the country in 1906.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00577">We are told this is the voice of the people, that when you come to the last resort the House of Commons represents the voice of the people. We are frequently reminded of it in this House almost <i>ad nauseam</i>. But this phrase, "the voice of the people," like the majority at the last General Election, does require careful analysis. In the first place, the voice of the people would be much more effective and true as a phrase if redistribution were carefully carried out. The voice of the people is uncommonly partial in its operation. No one has a greater respect for the voice of the people than I have&#x2014;the deliberate voice of the informed people judging as between right and wrong on issues with which they are acquainted. But the voice of the people is so oddly constituted. In the city of Kilkenny, 1,742 votes represent the voice of the people; and in South Essex the same voice is represented by 53,000 votes. And yet I am perfectly certain of this, that the voice of the city of Kilkenny&#x2014;
<col>154</col>
I do not know in the least who the member is; I am speaking from general conviction&#x2014;I am perfectly certain that the voice of the people as coming from the city of Kilkenny is quite as loud as the voice of the people coming from South Essex.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00578">There is another puzzle about the voice of the people. I am not going into figures now&#x2014;I am sure Lord Avebury has them at his fingers' ends&#x2014;but statisticians will point out how very small a plurality of votes is sufficient to return a very large majority to represent the voice of the people in the House of Commons. I will not labour that point now; but I will point out this very curious circumstance. In the year 1889, twenty-one years ago, we established county councils, and there was an election for the London County Council. A Conservative Government was then in power, and the London County Council that was returned was almost entirely Liberal, even more than Liberal, in character. Now that was the voice of the people. Since then, I think hardly without an exception, whenever the voice of the people returned a Parliamentary majority on one side it returned an entirely different majority on the other side to serve it on the London County Council. Though that point is not a conclusive, one, yet it is, so to speak, a deduction from the large term, the voice of the people, which is always used against this House, and it has some value at the present moment. The voice of the people, whatever it may be, requires everywhere some protection against its own unguarded moments. The voice of the people, like the voice of individuals, requires some interval for reflection. None of us, no individual in this House, not even on the Right Reverend Bench, but has not at some time spoken and wished he had taken a little time for reflection before he had spoken. A Second Chamber if it is kept in efficency, does, at any rate, secure that the voice of the people should be deliberate and not impulsive. We all remember the familiar instance of the majority of forty that was returned in 1892 in favour of Irish Home Rule. This House&#x2014;utterly kicking outside the traces in a manner worthy of the severest condemnation of the House of Commons, and one which would be impossible under the Resolutions about to be proposed by my right hon. friend the Prime Minister&#x2014;threw the Bill out, The odd thing was that when we came to the next General Election, two years afterwards, the country by an enor-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0103"/>
<col>155</col>
mous majority, by a much larger majority than was given to the other side in the year 1892, went in the other direction. That, I think, shows that the voice of the people, when it is given time for consideration, has not always pronounced in the same absolutely consistent manner as is represented by those who constantly mention it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00579">I want to touch upon one other point in regard to the voice of the people. I frankly admit that in this part of what I am saying I am hoping that my voice may reach those outside rather than those inside, because the facts that are familiar to you are not always familiar to the great multitudes who read the newspapers in this country. The point I would endeavour to indicate in a passing sentence is this. I spoke just now of the revolution which followed the abolition of the House of Lords at the time of the Commonwealth. Revolutions, as a rule, are not carried out by the voice of the people. They are carried out by a small and determined minority. The very House of Commons which carried this revolution was a mere rump, a fragment, of the original House of Commons. The very execution of Charles I was carried, according to the testimony of all historians, by a comparatively small minority of the British people. Those who effected the beneficent revolution of 1688&#x2014;most of whom, by the way, were members of this discredited House of Lords&#x2014;those who brought over William III, were, it is universally held, a minority of the people. Those who brought about the fall of the French Monarchy by the storming of the Tuileries in 1792 were not even France, not even Paris, but a deputation from Marseilles that came to Paris for that purpose. The execution of Louis XVI, his wife, and his blameless sister was not carried out either by France or by Paris, according to all testimony, but by a comparatively small minority of the capital. Therefore, it is not the voice of the people that we have&#x2014;whether well-founded or not&#x2014;in great revolutionary movements, but it is the voice of a small, determined, and intrepid minority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00580">Well, my Lords, this is the effect of the policy of the Government on these hapless islands upon which we live. They are deliberately about to establish government by single Chamber without regard to precedents or authority or history, with a sole view to their own apparent convenience and the wishes of a large section of their followers.
<col>156</col>
That is the effect on these islands. What will be the effect on the Empire when these Resolutions are made known to the Empire? You will announce from that Bench to the great Dominions of the Crown outside these islands that the House of Lords has been first emasculated and then abolished; and that a <i>paulo post futurum</i> Second Chamber is about to be brought in, or may be discerned in the political mirage which is never likely to be realised. Will not that bring about some diminution of confidence on the part of those Dominions of the Crown with regard to this Parliament? A single Chamber which is liable to every form of impulse, which is liable to every gust of popular enthusiasm, is a singularly strange centre for a disseminated Empire like ours. Our strength as a centre does not lie in forcing the pace for our Colonies, but in moderating, sobering, and guiding them, and so careful have we been that not merely should they be moderated, sobered, and guided from the centre, that wherever we have granted a Constitution to a self-governing Colony we have taken the greatest pains to plant side by side with an elective Chamber at least an equally strong and efficient Second Chamber. I am afraid the Dominions would ask their bewildered representatives in this country, "Are these Second Chambers for external application only? Are they of no use to the Mother Country which insisted on our receiving them, sometimes very unwillingly? And are we now to be told&#x2014;these great self-governing communities will say&#x2014;this is all very well for you; but we, the heart, the parent, and the mainspring of the Empire, are going to be satisfied with a rump of a Senate, or no Senate at all?"</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00581">Now, what will the Greater Britains say? The Greater Britains, I think you will all acknowledge in this House, are day by day influencing, more and more, our convictions and our proceedings in this country. These great forward communities, which some of us have visited, represent, to some extent, our future; and, therefore, we take into account their counsels and their opinions every day more and more. Will your announcement cement or inspire the confidence of these great communities? How shall we explain our proceedings to them? Take the case of Canada. The noble and venerable High Commissioner of Canada has a seat in this House. I do not know if he is here now, certainly I do not expect him
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0104"/>
<col>157</col>
to answer me now, but I shall be curious some time or another to learn in what form of despatch he proposes to communicate the Resolutions of the Imperial Government to the people of Canada. He will inform them that the people of Canada were granted by the Act of 1867 a strong Senate possessing control over finance, and endowed with all the authority which a Second Chamber could possess. Lord Strathcona would have to tell the Senate of Canada that that was all very well for them, but that for Great Britain it has now been thrown on the dust heap. A High Commissioner has just come over from Australia&#x2014;the first High Commissioner, Sir George Reid, a man of infinite ability, popularity, geniality&#x2014;no better choice could possibly have been made. But it is hard upon him that his first task should be to write a Despatch to his Government in Australia, which must also begin:&#x2014;"In 1900 an Act was passed for Australia giving them a strong and efficient Senate, with financial rights, with financial control. It is my painful duty to inform you that the Imperial Government considers that, though that is very well for Australia, it considers the purpose of a Senate to be useless and inefficient as regards the Mother Country."</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00582">But all their difficulties rolled into one will not equal those to be encountered by my noble and unfortunate friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He will have to write a Despatch to South Africa. He will have to state to South Africa:&#x2014;"Last year we concurred with you in producing a Constitution for you with two Chambers, a lower Chamber, as it used to be called, and a Senate with financial control and the power of rejecting, but not amending, Money Bills. We took it to our Sovereign for his signature and approval, and we obtained that signature and approval. Now I regret to inform you that we are about to submit for the signature and approval of our Sovereign regulations doing away with all the powers of the Second Chamber in this country and reducing it to a nullity. You will understand in South Africa why this is done without any unnecessary explanations from me." At least if my noble friend takes a hint from me, that is the form which his Despatch will take. It will be addressed, with a strange irony, to the last of the Peers, who has reluctantly submitted to the yoke of entering this dis-
<col>158</col>
credited, dishonoured House. I am afraid South Africa will consider that for the last eighteen months we have been going through a sort of pantomime in Great Britain. And now they are to be told that the Government are not merely going to take up these Resolutions to the same Sovereign who signed the Constitution of South Africa last year, but they are going to demand from him guarantees of a nature which have not yet been specified, to reverse the very principle which they insisted upon for South Africa last year. If this is not deliberately digging the grave of Empire, I cannot conceive any measure more likely to do it. What a spectacle we shall present&#x2014;the Mother of Parliaments digging up her Constitution by the roots, then cutting away the roots, and planting what remains at some future time in some barren and unfruitful soil to wither alone! You will have shaken faith in every part of your Dominions in your Constitution, and in the validity of your Constitution. You will have shaken faith in the stability of your institutions, and, what is worse than all, in the stability of your race, and when all belief in the stability of your race has gone, your Empire will not be long in following.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00583">My Lords, I would ask you to turn your eyes away from the melancholy spectacle presented by the contrast between what we enact for the great Dominions of the Crown outside and what we enact for ourselves&#x2014;I would ask you to turn for a moment from that spectacle to two other great democracies from which we may take some warning in the course that we are invited to pursue. Think of the United States. I must say I tremble when I think of the scorn of the United States when it witnesses our one-eyed, one-legged search for a Constitution in the twentieth century of the Christian era. What will they say to us? "One hundred and thirty-four years ago we set out on a lonely and dangerous voyage in order to get away from the tyranny, as we considered it, of a Parliament in which we were not represented. What did we do when we began to keep house for ourselves, to frame a Constitution for ourselves? We at once instituted the double veto which we had left behind in England&#x2014;the veto of the Sovereign and the veto of the Second Chamber. We have, unlike you, retained both those virtues, and the veto of the Sovereign, that is, the President for the time being,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0105"/>
<col>159</col>
is stronger than it ever was, the veto of the Senate is stronger than it ever was. Both vetoes have gained strength with our strength, and grown with our growth, and you are now trying with your eyes open, in spite of our experience and our example, to put your neck under the yoke of what Cromwell truly described as the cruellest arbitrariness in the world." I tremble to think of the scorn of the United States when it witnesses our constitutional operations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00584">There is another country, France, with which we are daily endeavouring to enter into more and more cordial relations. France has had a longer and a more diversified experience of democratic revolution than any country in Europe, than any country in the world. It began with the great Revolution of 1789, and that Revolution has not burnt itself out yet. It is still seething in the body politic of France. After four or five revolutions France at length, in a moment of reaction from Empire, set about framing its own Constitution. There seemed a great opportunity then for carrying into effect some of the democratic proposals which find so much favour with His Majesty's present advisers. They were an advanced community; what did they do? Did they do away with the veto or the Senate? They constructed the strongest Senate that they could possess, with control over finance&#x2014;a control which it constantly exercises, and, what is more&#x2014;what has never been possessed by this House, or, so far as I know, by other Senates, though I am not deeply versed in the history of the minor Senates&#x2014;with a veto over the dissolution of the whole Parliament, which it constantly exercises. What will France think when it sees our search for a new Constitution based upon a single Chamber?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00585">What will all countries say, for, after all, the experience of all countries is identical in the matter, it does not vary? It does not give you any chip or spark of encouragement. You have to follow blindly in the dark without any precedent to help you. I beg your pardon&#x2014;there are precedents, there is something from which you can get some encouragement; there are two exceptions to the general protest of all civilised communities against being governed by a single Chamber. I will name them. They are Greece and Costa Rica. I have been a phil-Hellene
<col>160</col>
in my time, and I am sure we all wish very well to Greece. I am sure also we do not wish to say anything which could be in any way offensive to the feelings of the Greek nation, but I do feel that even though we are in some perturbation at this moment, we do not particularly envy the condition of Greece. Nor does it inspire us with any great encouragement to pursue the visionary search for a single-Chamber Government. As for Costa Rica, I know less, and I have not studied the history of Costa Rica. It has not been accessible to me so much as I could wish. But from the imperfect means at my disposal I gather this, that the existence of Costa Rica has been pretty evenly divided between government by a single Chamber and government by a dictatorship&#x2014;I think more often government by dictatorship than government by a single Chamber. There seems to be a necessary alternation between the two. That is our position, that is the path sketched out for us by His Majesty's Government in the first decade of the twentieth century. We are going under their guidance to turn our backs on all experience, to scorn all precedent, to flout all tradition, to embark on a cheerless and perilous journey, without any guide or compass or encouragement, every omen portending disaster in the strenuous emulation of Greece and Costa Rica.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00586">Will the country, when it is face to face with this course, be likely to adopt it? I have a very strong opinion on that point. I am quite convinced that the country, when it is asked to embrace single-Chamber government at the invitation of Ministers, will not do so. But whether or not they do so, our course is clear. We, representing the most ancient Chamber of Legislature in this country, are bound to submit our plan to the country, to avoid this overwhelming evil and this catastrophe of Empire. The choice before us is this&#x2014;you can choose from two options. One is the preservation of the present House exactly as it is but with greatly diminished and indeed vanishing power; the other is the reconstitution of this House with the maintenance of legislative rights. That is, you may choose between being a Chamber of titled phantoms or a Chamber effective to exercise all the proper functions of a Second Chamber. I cannot doubt your choice as between those two options, and still less can I doubt the choice of the country. So, my
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0106"/>
<col>161</col>
Lords, we come by natural evolution to the question of procedure and the question of proposals. I must apologise for having detained you so long in examining the plan of the Government, but it was a necessary procedure to adopt to examine what the alternative was which the Government have to offer the country before we sketch out in any way whatever our own proposals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00587">I suggest, and I think it is the general idea of this House, that we should proceed by Resolution and not by Bill. We proceed by Resolution for two obvious reasons. The first is that a Bill is an affair of the Government&#x2014;that nothing less than a Government can offer a Bill on a great measure of constitutional reform; and, secondly, a Bill must go into accurate details of administration which it is not, in my judgment, expedient for this House to attempt to do. What we have to do, as I conceive, is this&#x2014;moving slowly perhaps, but so far as possible with the consent of a large body of opinion in this House&#x2014;to frame general Resolutions of principle on which some future Government may propound a measure of reform. I think some people have thought that the Committee of the Whole House is too large a body to undertake the work of considering a scheme such as this, but it was not possible in reality to take any other. You have already appointed a Select Committee. It would be useless to appoint another; and it would be worse than useless because it would have been a work of procrastination and delay.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00588">The Resolutions should, I think, one by one embody the principles on which reform in this House should proceed. I have laid on the Table three Resolutions of a preliminary nature which I hope your Lordships will be able to consider without delay. Indeed, I am sanguine enough to think that they might be passed before what has come to be called the ecclesiastical holiday of Easter. I do not know whether that is too great a demand, but I would point out that the first two Resolutions are, I think, practically unopposed by any considerable body of opinion in this House, and might be passed without difficulty. The third, I admit, is more contentious, but at any rate it could be passed without many days debate, and if so it would be eminently desirable, I think, that it should be passed before Easter. Then
<col>162</col>
we would lay other Resolutions. I am anxious to take the largest possible body of opinion in the House with the proposals as they are formulated, and therefore I should be in no undue or indecent hurry to lay them on the Table.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00589">May I say a word about the Report of your own Committee? That was the one result of all the motions that have been made on this subject in my lifetime. I am not responsible for the Report of that Committee, though it is generally named after me as I was Chairman. It did not follow the lines I particularly cared about, and though I was glad to get it, I did not think it by any means adequate, even at that time, to the necessities of the occasion. But that Committee laboured under very considerable difficulties. The Government ostentatiously washed their hands of its proceedings and declined to have anything whatever to do with it. Therefore, though we had a Committee nominally of twenty-six, but really of twenty-five owing to the lamented absence of the late Duke of Devonshire, we had only three Liberals&#x2014;three bold and audacious Liberals&#x2014;who broke through Party discipline and ventured to sit with us. One was our lamented friend Lord Selby, who was an orthodox Liberal and of most valuable assistance to our Committee; the other was Lord Courtney, who, I think, is less orthodox, if he will allow me to say so, because he has a rooted antipathy to being in a majority of any description or kind, and therefore, with a defect so uncommon and so unorthodox, he must be ranked as a Liberal who is not quite according to the letter of the law. And then we had my friend Lord Ribblesdale, who was also a valuable addition to the Committee, but who, to use his own expression, is rather a freebooting Liberal, and came on an independent footing to join us. What I want to point out is that of twenty-five members, two of whom may be reckoned as independent and three as Liberals, we had nineteen Conservatives, which was an undue and unbalanced proportion. I honestly do not think that anybody who had been in that Committee and listened to its discussions, which were very long&#x2014;too long as some members thought, but not too long as the Chairman thought&#x2014;would have known, if his eyes were shut, to which political complexion the speaking member belonged. There was a real and anxious desire on the part
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0107"/>
<col>163</col>
of every member of the Committee to throw his mind without prejudice into the common stock and to endeavour to produce the best result obtainable in the circumstances. On that I think I can appeal to my noble friends behind me who were on the Committee for corroboration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00590">I will not conceal from your Lordships even at the stage of going into Committee that it seems to me there are two vital principles at stake so vital that without adopting them it is useless to touch this work of reform at all. The first is the question of heredity and of doing away with the hereditary right to a seat in this House, which forms the third of the Resolutions on the Table, and which was the unanimous, spontaneous recommendation of your Committee.</p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00596"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I am not disputing the validity of my noble friend's contention. I am quite sure that, wherever he was, he was usefully and honourably employed. What I am saying is that when the Resolution was put to the Committee it was unanimously passed. I want to point out, however, that the hereditary principle is not inherent in the constitution of this House, and did not originally form any part
<col>164</col>
of the constitution of this House. Your Lordships must be aware, I think, that a majority of Peers in this House up to the time of the Reformation did not sit by any hereditary right at all, and, therefore, three centuries and a-half ago it was a majority of Peers sitting by personal and life tenure that prevailed in the House of Lords.<lb/>
Hereditary tenure was no doubt very useful for feudal purposes, and in that way it came to be the practice in this House; but I think we shall all admit that as a legislative engine it is open to grave objection, and that it has outlived its usefulness in our community. It is the part of our constitution which is most objectionable to the country and most resented by the people at large. It is the most easy to attack and the most difficult to defend. The defence used to be that it works well in practice; but it has ceased to work well in practice. It is no sufficient answer, as has been frequently given during the late election, to point to the eminence of our members and to the excellence of our debates. In the mind of the nation at large that does not touch the question. Suppose, if you can suppose, a House composed of Shakespeares, Bacons, Newtons, and Burkes. Even then you would not remove the objection to the hereditary constitution of the House because its critics would at once say that these are men of high and exalted genius, but how are we to ensure that their successors will inherit their genius with their names, and so far as we know anything about the progeny of these great men, and so far as they have had progeny, it is not the case.<lb/>
There is the further objection that I sketched at the beginning of these proceedings that we are given a great many more Peers than we want. It is enlarging the numbers in this House to an extent which is almost dangerous. A fertilising stream like the Nile flows annually, almost weekly, into this House; but unlike the Nile it does not retire. The stream is copious and constant, but there is no outlet, and when we consider the rate at which Peers have been created and are likely to be created in future, even without the mysterious guarantees which are in certain circumstances to be demanded, we may well begin to think that we shall have to ask the House of Commons to provide us with a more spacious Chamber if anything like our present constitution is to be preserved. Under the present Government, as far as I recollect, thirty-six or
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0108"/>
<col>165</col>
thirty-seven Peerages have been created, three in the last fortnight&#x2014;at any rate nine or ten every year the Government have been in existence, a surprising number considering the extreme distaste which the Liberal Party express of any contact with the House of Lords. Of course, if one may believe the statements of those who fix a coronet of promise on certain names outside this House, the number will be very considerably increased, almost to the extent of the guarantees that are to be demanded of the Crown. I venture to think that, although that is a matter which may raise a laugh, it is a grave subject. It bears upon the whole question of the hereditary principle, and I think I may say on the broad grounds which I have stated, without going into any that are more invidious, that the hereditary principle is a source of weakness and not a source of strength to this House, strength being what we want.<lb/>
The second principle which I would ask you to adopt, and which I regard as vital to any reform which may be made in this House, is that of election from outside. That is a new principle in this country; but it is not new elsewhere. It is almost unanimously the practice elsewhere, and I will name it as being the practice in one specially Conservatives country&#x2014;the Kingdom of Prussia&#x2014;where the House of Lords is freely recruited from the representative element. The House of Lords in Prussia has more strength and more constitutional power than is possessed by this House. But, even if it be a new principle, if we are to deal with this question at all we must not be afraid of new principles. They will soon lose their novelty in application, and if we are not to adopt any new principle in the process of reconstitution, I am afraid our reconstitution will be a futile enterprise. After all, nothing can be so anomalous as the British Constitution itself. We are afraid to introduce new principles into it. But, really, when you come to analyse the Constitution itself one might be inclined to think that a little novelty might to some extent improve it.<lb/>
You began with a House of Commons with a double Veto over it&#x2014;the Veto of the Sovereign and the Veto of the House of Lords. The Veto of the Sovereign has not been exercised since the reign of Queen Anne, and is dormant, so dormant that it may be said to have perished of disuse. At any rate, it is not likely to come into
<col>166</col>
action in our time. Having got rid of one Veto by disuse you are seeking to get rid of the other by enactment, leaving the House of Commons free to pursue its own devices. If you are to get rid of all the old principles that animate the British Constitution you will have to embrace some new ones if you want to place your Constitution upon a satisfactory footing. I venture to think that nothing but the elective principle will give new life and strength to this Second Chamber. Nothing else will give you that contact with national life and national opinion which is necessary for the strength of any Chamber exercising the functions with which we are endowed. The hereditary principle has not given and cannot give us that strength. The addition of life Peers, which has sometimes been suggested, has not given and cannot give you that strength. Let me give a familiar illustration. Take two popular men and make them life Peers. Take the two gentlemen who, I understand, are most popular on Liberal platforms at this moment&#x2014;Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston Churchill. Both are very able orators. Make them life Peers and put them in this House, and in a year, or two years at most, they would have no more contact with the people than any other member of this House, and they would lose all the advantages which elective principle gives them, and the strength they receive from delegation, and would have to rely upon their mere sheer ability alone. I give that as an illustration of how little strength you may hope to get from life Peers alone.<lb/>
When I speak of election I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not wish it to be supposed that I would venture to propose that any addition to this House should be arrived at by means of popular election. That would only give an understudy, a feeble understudy, of the House of Commons; and, further, it would multiply all the horrors of a General Election, which we must all be anxious to avoid. If by any action, direct or indirect, of this House we should put another General Election on the national programme it would be, I think, imputed to us as a crime. That all the misstatements, all the personalities, all the foolish and erroneous placards, all the actual lies which are employed at a General Election should be repeated for our benefit and selection would, I think, be a most detestable and impossible proposition.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0109"/>
<col>167</col>
I do believe that this ancient and illustrious Assembly would derive new strength, new grace, new dignity by association with the corporations and county councils of this country formed into elective bodies very much on the French basis; and I am bound to say that this representation, in my judgment, so far as it has any value, should form no inconsiderable proportion of this House. Remember that even if elected they might still be Peers. It would be open to any member of your Lordships' House to stand for election outside; and I venture to think that any Peer, however illustrious his name and however long his descent, would gain, not lose, in dignity by entering this House as the representative, say, of Yorkshire or Lancashire.<lb/>
I will not go further into details. I only want, on this occasion at any rate, to establish two principles, which I repeat I believe are vital to any work of reform and without which it is no use entering upon any operation at all. These principles, with all my heart and soul and with all the earnestness which I can use on so great and so solemn an occasion, I implore your Lordships to recognise and adopt. I believe that at this critical moment you have an opportunity of rendering your country a greater service than has fallen to any body of men since the Barons wrested the liberties of England from King John at Runnymede. You, like them, may rescue the nation from an impending despotism, not the despotism of a King, but the even more formidable despotism of a single and irresponsible Chamber. You have to preserve and to vindicate the balance of our ancient Constitution. You have to protect the nation from the legislation of impulse and of passion and of excess. You have to guard the rights of minorities from the tyranny of the majority. You can do all this by surrendering privileges which day by day are growing less valuable, which act as a barrier between you and the rest of the nation; and, having made that concession, by framing ungrudgingly and unselfishly, in a large and generous spirit, a reformed House of Lords which shall claim and deserve the confidence of the country.<lb/>
My Lords, the Government must soon go to the country with its plan. Let us, too, go with ours. Let us, in our turn,
<col>168</col>
appeal to that supreme tribunal&#x2014;for, after all, in the long run, in the last resort, it is the nation that must judge&#x2014;not the High Court of Parliament, not the House of Lords, or even the House of Commons. Demonstrate to your countrymen that the plan of the Government is a single-Chamber plan and therefore spells disaster to the nation, and offer your alternative plan, which you may truly say is offered in the interests of the nation and not of a Party or of yourselves. What is the alternative? The alternative is to cling with enfeebled grasp to privileges which have become unpopular, to powers which are verging on the obsolete, shrinking and shrinking until at last, under the unsparing hands of the advocates of single-Chamber government, there may arise a demand for your own extinction, or the Second Chamber, the ancient House of Lords, may be found waiting in decrepitude for its doom.<lb/>
I daresay in the course of this discussion you will be reminded of a memorable night in the great French Revolution, the night of August 4, 1789, when to successive waves of passionate enthusiasm the aristocracy of France surrendered privilege after privilege, until those who had entered that hall a proud and powerful aristocracy left it as simple citizens. My noble and learned friend appears to have that incident in his head. He, perhaps, will tell you that that great concession brought about the French Revolution. If he tells you so, and he does not say he will tell you, he will tell you wrongly. The Bastille had fallen and the Revolution had begun. The lesson to be learned from that memorable night is not the lesson of privileges conceded to a popular demand. They were in themselves gross and exorbitant privileges, such as would not have been tolerated in this country during the last three centuries&#x2014;privileges of forced labour, privileges in some cases of serfage, privileges of total exemption from taxation and what not, privileges as unlike as possible to that modest right of concurrent legislation which we are still permitted to exercise. The lesson from that night is a widely different one. It is the lesson of too late. Had the French aristocracy made that surrender a hundred years earlier they might have saved the Monarchy and the State. What would have been the salvation of France in the reign of Louis XIV came too late in the reign of Louis XVI.<lb/>

My Lords, the words "too late" are written across the history of every national catastrophe. Those words shall not be written here. I am confident of the wisdom and patriotism of this House; so confident that I am convinced that they will rise to the height of this great occasion and vindicate the balance of the Constitution. You will, my Lords, if I am not greatly mistaken, save the Constitution by maintaining the guarantees that that Constitution demands; you will save the future of your country, for nothing less than the future of your country is involved; and for yourselves you will earn the imperishable honour and imperishable gratitude not merely of the nation now, but of generations yet unborn so long as the history of this country survives.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00598"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATER FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend who has moved this Motion has spoken, as he always does, of course, with eloquence, with passion, with feeling, and with knowledge. I could, if this were the suitable place, follow, I am afraid with dissent, some of his historical analogies. First of all, I distrust the application of experiences of other times and countries to our own political difficulties and perplexities. You can never be quite sure that you thoroughly understand all the conditions which produce such events, for example, as the night of the Fourth of August or the Fall of the Bastille. You can never be sure even in details, and I am not certain that my noble friend is perfectly free from remark.<lb/>
My noble friend dwelt with great force on the case of our great Colonies, of Canada and Australia, and asked your Lordships to consider with what scorn they would look on any action in this Parliament which abolished the two-Chamber system. My noble friend surely overlooked the fact that the Senate, or Second Chamber, in Canada and Australia is purely a nominated Chamber. Therefore, there is no argument whatever to be drawn from that part of my noble friend's case. I will not delay the House by following him in some of these details. I shall have a word to say about
<col>170</col>
Cromwell by-and-by, as to whom my noble friend and I have often differed.<lb/>
But to-night, my Lords, you have got to consider not historical analogies nor eloquent appeals as to your Lordships' making great sacrifices&#x2014;you have to consider what my noble friend, I venture to say, has overlooked, the practical emergency by which you are confronted. I think I shall be able to show that my noble friend's proposal does not really come to the fringe of that emergency. He analysed with great skill and a good deal of justice, I do not deny it for a moment, the nature of the last election, and the majority which retains the present Government in power. Well, but a remarkable thing has happened. My noble friend has done what is described as treating great questions as if they were great and solemn realities&#x2014;as if they were real. He has done that, but he has overlooked a remarkable circumstance. The last time I had the honour of addressing your Lordships I ventured to wind up my remarks with this observation, that there was no such battleground for ferocious Party conflict as the revision of the Constitution. I pointed out that we were entering on a tremendous journey which would be long, fierce in antagonisms, and probably perilous. Whether the tremendous drama which was opened at the end of November last year is to be a five-act drama or only a three-act drama I do not know. My noble friend to-night has, at all events, opened the second act of the play.<lb/>
I am a little surprised, I must say, and I should think that your Lordships at large must be, that he was not content to wait until the proposals of the Government were before the House. He drew an enormous number of inferences from those proposals as he depicts them in his own mind, but for my own part I think that the noble Marquess opposite was far wiser when he took exactly the opposite line from my noble friend on the first night of the session, and said that he thought it would be better, and I am not sure that he did not say fairer, to defer discussion of these things until the proposals of His Majesty's Government were laid before the House. I shall be glad to know how it is that if my noble friend is to have the support of the Leader of the Opposition the noble Marquess has changed his mind? My noble friend will remember that the first Motion that he made on this subject in this House, I think in 1888&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0111"/>
<col>171</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00599"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: In 1884. That was the last in 1888.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00600"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The second was in 1888, and was very similar in purport to the Motion raised to-night. It was then met by an Amendment from Lord Wemyss to the effect that if any change in the constitution of this House were required it ought not&#x2014;it ought to be not the result of any proceedings of a Committee, but ought to spring from proposals made by the Ministers of the Crown of the day. That evidently was in the mind of the noble Marquess and it would have been a far more convenient course if that principle had been accepted.<lb/>
But, my Lords, an extraordinary transformation in the drama has taken place since November, 1909. At that time, when the object was to reject the Budget, we heard from all the benches opposite that this House was a model of impartiality, that it was prefectly fair, and had all the virtues that a Legislative Chamber could possibly have, far removed from all the base arts of mechanical confederacy in ordinary political warfare. But to-day what is the foundation of the case which my noble friend is pressing on the House. It is that this House is indefensible in its constitution, is in urgent need of reform, and ought to strip itself of its rights and privileges, or some of them, at all events, at any price, and that you must drop the principle of an hereditary Legislature; in fact, that it is as little a decent revising Chamber as could be possibly devised or imagined. That is a very remarkable transformation. I heard the other day a story of a noble Lord&#x2014;I do not know who it is, but he is not one of the working bees in this House&#x2014;who voted against the Budget and went down to his northern domain, where he spoke against the Budget, greatly to the disgust of the people who listened. They broke his windows and expressed their disapproval in the roughest way. The noble Lord felt that that being the result of the last vote he had given, it was rather hard that the next vote that he was going to be asked to give, after sacrificing his convenience to that extent, was for his own extinction. That is only an illustration of the transformation that has taken place. You first of all commit homicide by slaying our Budget, and then proceed to commit suicide by denouncing yourselves as entirely unfit to have done the very thing that you did.<lb/>
<col>172</col>
The House will wish to know what is the view taken by the Government of my noble friend's Motion. When the subject came up before in 1907 the Government then took the view that it was illusory and worse than useless to discuss any proposals for changing the constitution of this House unless attention was paid to and a decision arrived at in relation to the differences and disputes which arise between the two Houses. It was on that ground that they did not enter the Committee, of which action my noble friend has just severely complained. The Government adhered to the principle of my noble friend's Amendment on that occasion. We still think it inexpedient to discuss proposals for reforming this House until provision has been made for an effective method of settling differences that may arise between this House and the other House of Parliament. But as our own proposals will be, we hope, before your Lordships at no distance of time, we do not think it necessary to move an Amendment to that effect to-night. We shall lay them before you, in the words of the King's Speech, "with all convenient speed." It is our intention to lay them before you as soon as they have passed the House of Commons. The House of Commons will be invited to discuss the proposals on Tuesday in Easter week, so that your Lordships will be able to compute from that date when they are likely to be here.<lb/>
The difference in the policy and the tactics recommended by the noble Marquess opposite on the first night of the session and the course actually taken by my noble friend looks as if there had been some forcing of the noble Marquess's hand. I suppose it has been forced on the noble Marquess by the intelligence that must have reached him from all his colleagues, from members of his Party who got in at the General Election, and from candidates who were defeated, by all manner of supplications, asseverations, and indications that it was the hereditary character of this House which, in my noble friend's words, "broke the shins" of candidates. I wonder what my noble friend's real expectations are of good coming from the action that he has to-night begun, because this is only the beginning. He said, on the occasion which I have already referred to, that&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00605"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: A good deal has happened since then.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00606"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Then as for the Liberals, my noble friend cannot have forgotten what happened in 1894. He was then the head of a Government, and he made an admirable speech, not less admirable than the one which he has made to-night, against the House of Lords, and I hope I am not betraying Cabinet secrets when I mention that the result of that state of mind of the head of the Government was the appointment of a Cabinet Committee. And when that Committee had sat for a considerable time, the question was put how they were getting on, and it appeared that, though they had had considerable deliberation and frequent meetings, they had not yet settled the question whether they wanted to make this House stronger or weaker.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00607"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I was not on that Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00608"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Nor was I. Then my noble friend falls back on the people whom he calls "the thinking part of the nation." He says you cannot expect a Tory Government, you cannot get a Liberal Government, to take up this question, and he falls back, therefore, on what he calls the thinking part of the nation. That is a very unkind aspersion on the human race. It seems to follow from that that Liberals and Conservatives are the unthinking part of the nation. He excludes us, politicians, from the thinking part of the nation. I wonder what his idea of the thinking part of the nation is. I remember Mr. Bright once, when he was reproached for voting against Mr. Mill on some point or other and asked, "How could you vote against a great thinker," replying, in very gruff language,
<col>174</col>
"The worst of great thinkers is they generally think wrong." I should be the last man in this House to fall into any vulgar or Philistine language about thinking people, but I am sceptical as to there being in existence a great body of men who are too good to be Tories, too good to be Liberals, but who, somehow or another, are to be good enough some day or another to carry a scheme for the reform of the House; of Lords. You will have to get the politicians into it.<lb/>
My noble friend has said, though I do not think he repeated it to-night, and it is an important observation, that the thinking part of the country would prefer the House of Lords unreformed to no Second Chamber at all, and, if I may speak of the people who do not think, I agree, and I should share their prepossession. But my noble friend has gone too rapidly in assuming that all Ministers, or voters, or members of Parliament who support the Resolutions which will come before your Lordships' House by-and-by are all single-Chamber men. You may, if you care, draw out the chain of inference, as my noble friend did, showing that it may lead somehow or another, some day or another, to a single Chamber. That is not the intention of those who will send these Resolutions up to your Lordships' House. It is not inherent: in the Resolutions or in the purposes of the Resolutions, and there are many both in the House of Commons and outside of the House of Commons who would prefer a House of Lords unreformed&#x2014;I mean unreformed in structure and in composition&#x2014;to the most attractive single Chamber that the wit of man could devise or the most aerial fabric which could be devised out of rainbows by political ingenuity. I hope that that will not be thought inappropriate in reply to some of my noble friend's observations, and I hope a note may be taken of it by all those whom it concerns.<lb/>
My noble friend did me the honour to appeal to me to say something as to the language of predominance, imputing predominance to the House of Commons. As to the word, I do not defend it, but I should think that no single man has ever used language in this House, neither Mr. Disraeli nor Lord Salisbury nor anybody you like, which could be taken to dispute for an instant the predominance in legislation of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

Here is Mr. Balfour's account in his election address. It is perfectly familiar; no one here will dispute it for a moment. How does he describe it? It saves one the trouble of turning to books about the Constitution. These are Mr. Balfour's own words&#x2014;
<quote>"The representative Assembly is no doubt the primary organ of the popular will. It determines, without appeal, the political complexion of the Government. It controls all the Estimates. It initiates all the taxes. In legislation, it is the dominating power. Its Ministers direct and sometimes tyrannise over its deliberations. They are, nevertheless, its creatures, and, while no veto of the House of Lords can reduce the salary of an Under-Secretary by a single shilling, the most powerful Cabinet is still obliged to bow to the House of Commons."</quote>
Therefore when you are drawing this terrible hobgoblin of a single Chamber think how far off from single-Chamber government you are now. Foreign policy, and all policy outside legislation, is indisputably in the hands of a single Chamber. My Lords, this question is raised by a practical emergency. I will not argue whether this House of Lords' question was raised by you or by us, or, as I think, neither by you nor by us, if you are going to speak philosophically about it; it arose from the inevitable state of the case and out of fatal necessities of human things.<lb/>
<col>176</col>
Think what Lord Salisbury said in 1894; how untrue, how mistaken it has proved. Lord Salisbury said in 1894 if once your Irish policy is out of the way&#x2014;that was the policy of my noble friend and myself&#x2014;the House of Lords would settle back into the old position when parties were fairly evenly balanced, though there was a leaning towards the Conservative side. That was a very natural opinion for a man like Lord Salisbury to hold, and a not unreasonable expectation, but forces, deep forces, were too strong, and they have been growing stronger and stronger. The gulf&#x2014;yes, the gulf is not too strong a term&#x2014;between your Lordships' House and the House of Commons has widened and deepened since 1894, not owing to a mischievous spirit in either one Party or the other, but owing to the fact that great new masses of voters have come into electoral power, and they are using that electoral power, and will continue to use it to satisfy their own aspirations and meet their own needs. If you had not, my Lords, been driven violently down a steep place against the Budget, if you had only steered clear&#x2014;I hope you will forgive me for speaking in an oracular tone, but it is my convinced opinion that if you had only steered clear of exorbitant pretensions in the matter of finance this House might perhaps have faced the election&#x2014;there having been no intervening election&#x2014;the election in the normal course of things with a great deal more composure than any of you, on the one side or the other, can face the next election when it does come. The noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, has said something about his being in favour of reform, but not of destruction. When he listened to my noble friend to-night, and heard, first, that the hereditary principle is to go, and secondly, that the elective principle is to be largely adopted, and if he followed those thoughts out into all the devices that are connected with them, I wonder whether the noble Earl does not see something that might be called destruction in what lies before him. And when he says we do not know where we are going, I wonder if my noble friend and noble Lords opposite who are going to follow him into the Lobby realise with any clearness, firmness, and precision where they are going.

<quote>"For the future a Peerage should not entitle a Peer to take part in the legislation of the House and we recommended on the Committee&#x2014;"</quote>
This is a remarkable expression&#x2014;
<quote>"that there should be a kind of Inner House of Lords, composed partly of Peers whose qualifications and antecedents manifestly rendered them fit to take part in the proceedings in any legislative Chamber, partly of Peers selected from amongst the Peers by the Peers themselves, and partly of Life Peers appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Government of the day, and in our belief that would have given a very compact and very efficient House of Lords. Now some enemy may say ' Oh, but that does not go nearly far enough; we want much greater reforms.' "</quote>
Lord Lansdowne continued&#x2014;
<quote>"Shall I say why I am opposed to much more far-reaching reforms? It is because I should always believe in the preponderating power of the House of Commons, and it is my belief that if you were to set up a House of Lords by some process of election, or otherwise placed in a position analogous to that of the House of Commons, you would inevitably find that the House of Lords would claim what it does not claim now&#x2014;a coordinate power with the popular House."</quote>
That is to say, the noble Marquess when he made the speech was averse, as his words seem to mean, to that principle of large and extended election which my noble friend quoted. Lord Salisbury made a very important criticism in the debate on Lord Wemyss's Amendment to my noble friend's Motion in 1888. Lord Salisbury said&#x2014;
<quote>"Depend upon it, if you ever succeed in so altering the character of this House that it consists entirely of determined politicians who always attend all the debates and attach the same weight and importance that are attached to their own opinions by those who sit in the House of Commons you will have pronounced the doom of our present system of Government."</quote>
That is to say, if you get this fancy Chamber full of busy, able, competent men you will then have, as Lord Salisbury said, pronounced the doom of our present system of Government. I submit that line of argument to the consideration of my noble friend and his supporters. Then I come to Lord St. Aldwyn. It is no secret what he would have liked and would like. He committed himself to the view that county councils should be empowered to send, or, that the Crown should be allowed to summon, to this House not more than eighty persons qualified for service&#x2014;that is, if they had served ten years in the House of Commons or on a county council.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00618"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Lord St. Aldwyn's. I think it is in the Report of the Committee. However these are his words. Then my noble friend proposed to give the right of nomination to representatives of boroughs of 500,000 population, and so on, but I hope your Lordships see what deep waters my noble friend's Motion is going to ask you to embark upon. You would find, supposing such a body could come into existence, a very different Assembly from that which we are now confronting. Extraordinary language has been used in the way of pretensions. Lord Balfour of Burleigh has actually said that he considers this House cannot fulfil its functions efficiently unless it has some power in the last resort to compel an appeal to the country, which can alone demonstrate what is the real wish of the country. That may or may not have been permissible in the case of the Budget last November, but for this House now to claim&#x2014;I wonder whether my noble friend would back that&#x2014;that you are to have the power of compelling a Dissolution whenever you think a Dissolution is expedient&#x2014;I do not think that would be carried. And when language is used that this House has a perfect right to conduct its own internal reforms in its own way, I cannot imagine anything more entirely unreasonable and anything more entirely away from the facts. You can do nothing in the way of internal reform if it requires a Statute, any more than the House of Commons can reform itself without your assent.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0005P0I0115"/>
<col>179</col>
think, then, of course, it is absurd. I wish my noble friend had taken a little more trouble to tell us plainly what he means by the words "strong and efficient." What does he mean? I will tell your Lordships what I think the object of this Motion must be, and what the language implies. The language about "strong and efficient" means that this is a move&#x2014;I do not use the word cynically&#x2014;a move against the House of Commons. "Strong and efficient" in this House, on the scale contemplated by the mover of this Motion, must mean opposition to the House of Commons. And what are you doing? Your taking back&#x2014;that is an observation worthy of your Lordships' attention&#x2014;this demand for a great, strong, and efficient Second Chamber is really an attempt to take back that extension of popular electoral power which it is one of the glories of the Party opposite to have been instrumental in establishing. I should regard the erection, if you can do it, of a strong and efficient Second Chamber as a sort of counter to the policy of 1867. That policy was what Mr. Disraeli educated his Party to, partly, perhaps, to dish the Whigs, and this policy may be described by ill-natured people as designed to dish the Radicals. It is a retrograde proceeding, in my view, and will be judged as such.<lb/>
If the association of strength and efficiency means that you are to have your own way against the House of Commons, then I repeat that it is a taking back of electoral and political power which the persons concerned will assuredly not stand. I want, then, to ask how the proposals indicated by my noble friend's Motion will deal with the practical difficulties. I cannot for the life of me see how what my noble friend proposes will abate a single one of the perplexities and difficulties of the present situation. Let me look at one or two. Will it lessen the liabilities to friction between the two Houses? Surely not. The stronger and more efficient the Second House, the more will the chances of friction be both multiplied and intensified, for reasons described by Lord Salisbury in the language I have already quoted. One of the great complaints of this House is that Bills are not sent up here in time to receive adequate discussion. That is a complaint made, I understand, whichever Party is in power. I think the noble and learned Lord who sits opposite has loudly complained before now of his own political friends
<col>180</col>
begrudging time for adequate deliberation. But do you think that by having a strong and efficient Second Chamber that difficulty will be in any degree abated?<lb/>
What is the most injurious of all the complaints which are made against your Lordships' House? I believe all your Lordships will admit that it is the differential treatment which is given by this House to Liberal and to Conservative Bills. The popular impression is that this treatment is due to systematic class prejudice and systematic Party prepossession. Indeed, I do not believe that either the hereditary principle or anything else does half as much to lower the credit of your Lordships' House as this impression. How will adding strength to and invigorating the efficiency of this House cure that particular evil? I doubt if anybody does not expect that the new elements which my noble friend wants to have contributing to this House would be in their main leanings Conservative, and that, of course, is one of the reasons why you want it, and it is perfectly reasonable to expect that. But my noble friend has given us no single idea how his mode of dealing with the Second Chamber is going to make deadlocks between the two Houses&#x2014;which are the great mischiefs of the present system&#x2014;less frequent, less troublesome, and less dangerous. I wonder if he thinks that it will. No reform conducted without a scrupulous and exact and comprehensive regard for your Lordships' relations with the House of Commons, however strong and efficient you may be made, can touch this vital and central difficulty. If you do not do that you bring no relief at all to the difficulties of our situation. Do what you like to make your new House, your renovated House, strong and efficient, whether by the simple plan of reducing the numbers and creating an Inner House of Lords, as the noble Marquess called it, or by calling into existence some Senate or another&#x2014;do what you will it can never possess strength and efficiency except in the most strictly limited and narrow sense. Mr. Balfour used a very extraordinary expression the other day. He said you want this House to represent the permanent wishes of the nation. Nobody is a more exact speaker, but I declare I have not been able to think what he can mean by the "permanent wishes of the nation." Are there any? What, I wonder, was Mr. Balfour thinking of? Justice, freedom, equality
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0116"/>
<col>181</col>
before the law, and so forth&#x2014;but the permanent wishes of the nation! Who thinks so ill of his countrymen as to suppose that the electors of the House of Commons will ever send to represent them men who will be any more blind to the value of these great principles and laws of a modern State, more or less, than the House of Lords?<lb/>
I am only going to say a word more. All depends&#x2014;and this is a point worth bearing in mind because it goes to all your proceedings when Resolutions come before you&#x2014;all depends much more upon the powers that you are going to give to a Chamber than upon any dealing with constitution and function. When you probe the case to the core it is not the structure of a Second House which stands in the front. I say nothing against much that has fallen from my noble friend as to the great topics of internal reform of this House. Internal reforms, interesting, important, far-reaching as they may be, are essentially but secondary in comparison with the question of its powers over the legislation of the House of Commons. These are a few points which have been suggested to me by the Motion of my noble friend. He mentioned Cromwell. Whenever I pass the monument of Cromwell as I come to this House I naturally think of my noble friend. As I say, he and I do not agree as to all the achievements and policy of that illustrious figure. But I once wrote something about Cromwell, and if your Lordships would not think I was taking a liberty I would like to read a few sentences from it which are strictly germane. I said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no branch of political industry that men approach with hearts so light and yet that leaves them at the end so dubious and melancholy as the concoction of a Second Chamber. Cromwell and his Parliament&#x2014;"</quote>
as to which my noble friend said some things which I am not sure I would say&#x2014;
<quote>"set foot on this <i>Pons Asinorum</i> of democracy without a suspicion of its dangers. To call out of empty space an artificial House, without the hold upon men's minds of history and ancient association, without defined powers, without marked distinction of persons or interests, and then to try to make it into an effective screen against an elected House, to whose assent it owed its own being, was not to promote union but directly to promote division and to intensify it. Cromwell never thought out the scheme. Like smaller reformers since, Cromwell had never decided, to begin with, whether to make his Lords strong or weak; strong enough to curb the Commons, yet weak enough for the Commons to curb them."</quote>
<col>182</col>
I then added that the riddle which perplexed Cromwell was still unanswered. And I do not believe my noble friend's contribution will be an effective answer to that riddle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00623"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to address you upon this subject because, like the noble Earl who introduced it to-night, I twenty-six years ago stood up in your Lordships' House to implore your Lordships to give consideration to this subject. The only regret I have that the noble Earl should have brought the Motion forward&#x2014;and it is no fault of his&#x2014;is that it should be necessary to do so at the present moment. When the noble Earl first brought this subject forward in your Lordships' House he hoped, and I hoped, that it might be settled quietly and dispassionately at a time when the country was not divided by turmoil, was not in a state of paroxysm, as I venture to think it is at this moment, on this question. I should like to have seen the matter settled at a time when your Lordships could have given it a much more dispassionate consideration than I fear it is possible to give it to-day.<lb/>
The question was asked by the noble Viscount who has just sat down why the noble Earl did not wait for the Government's proposals, and I think he attributed to my noble friend the noble Marquess who sits behind me a declaration at the commencement of the session that to wait for the Government proposals would be the best course which this House could adopt. Well, my Lords, what were the Government proposals then and what are the Government proposals now? From the gracious Speech from the Throne we gathered that a measure was proposed, or rather two measures were to be introduced, dealing both with the powers of this House and with the constitution of the House; and I venture to say if that course had been maintained by His Majesty's Government the advice of my noble friend, that we should wait for those proposals, would have been quite right and proper advice. What is the position now? The proposals affecting the constitution of this House have disappeared into thin air, and we know now from the Prime Minister that the proposal is not to be dealt with as a whole, but that your Lordships are only to be asked to curtail your own powers of legislation.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0117"/>
<col>183</col>
There appears to be, from what the noble Viscount said, yet a fresh change in the plans of His Majesty's Government. The noble Viscount tells us they will propose some means of settling differences between the two Houses. I do not know, of course, what those means may be, but it is a new announcement from His Majesty's Government that they will introduce proposals for settling those differences. We shall look with interest and anxiety to the proposals His Majesty's Government are going to bring before us.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said he thought it was the recent election which had induced the noble Earl to suggest to your Lordships, as he will do in a few days, that the hereditary principle should not of itself give a right to sit in this House. That proposal came from the Committee of which my noble friend was the Chairman, and, as he told you, with the exception of my noble and learned friend behind me that proposition was unanimously accepted by the Committee. No elections had taken place then, nor was anything of the kind in contemplation. Then the noble Viscount went on to say that we have single-Chamber government already. He read out to us a list of the powers possessed by the other House of Parliament but not by this House. I do not think there is a single member of your Lordships' House who would wish to take from or share with that House any one of those powers to which the noble Viscount referred. But what we do claim is the power which we now possess, and which I venture to think any Second Chamber should possess&#x2014;the power to be satisfied that the country is in favour of great and drastic measures of reform, which have not been pronounced upon at a General Election, before those measures are allowed to pass through Parliament.<lb/>
We are in the midst of a great drama, says the noble Viscount Yes, but when Lord Newton moved for the appointment of the Committee to consider this subject the curtain had not been rung up on that drama. Yet the members of His Majesty's Government entirely declined to take any part or lot in an examination into the question. I deeply regret that decision on the part of His Majesty's Government, and I cannot help thinking that there must be some members on that side of the House who in their hearts, seeing
<col>184</col>
how evenly divided that Committee was on some important questions, regret equally that a greater part was not taken by noble Lords opposite. I cannot help thinking that if the Committee had had the advantage of the assistance of noble Lords opposite there might have been more guidance, more light and leading, for the people of this country. What did the refusal of His Majesty's Government to join that Committee amount to? It amounted, I think, to an admission that there was no conceivable Second Chamber, because the whole field of the reform of the Second Chamber was open to the Committee&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00624"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I ask the noble Earl whether that was so? My impression is that the reference to the Committee was to consider schemes and proposals of reform that had previously been made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00625"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: The reference was&#x2014;
<quote>"to consider the suggestions which have from time to time been made for increasing the efficiency of the House of Lords in matters affecting legislation, and to report as to the desirability of adopting them either in their original or in some modified form."</quote>
I admit that that confined the Committee to proposals which had already been made, or to any modification thereof, but I venture to think if you look through the proposals made from time to time for the reform of the Second Chamber it will be difficult to find any which are not under consideration at the present moment. The noble Earl, in moving that your Lordships do resolve yourselves into Committee, made some observations upon the "voice of the people," and I think he made it quite clear that there is much difficulty in determining when and how the voice of the people can be truly said to have spoken. I would like to add to what the noble Earl said that I think the people of this country do not always express their voice at a General Election. By that I mean that there is a considerable amount of apathy when there is no great and burning question before the country, and that it is sometimes most desirable that one should know what is the view, not only of a percentage of the electors, but of all those electors who can be brought to the poll. I was told a story the other day by a member who stood for the other House of Parliament
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0118"/>
<col>185</col>
that when he called upon an elector the latter said&#x2014;
<quote>"I suppose you have come to talk to me about the election. If you are a Radical I will kick you downstairs, and if you are a Unionist I shall content myself by banging the door in your face."</quote>
That was the extent of the interest that elector took in the election. When you look at the figures you will see that at the election of 1910, eighty-four per cent of the electors of London went to the poll; in 1906 only seventy-eight per cent voted; and in 1900 not more than sixty-five per cent. To say that the voice of that sixty-five per cent of the electorate is the real voice of the people is a proposition which will not bear a moment's examination.<lb/>
What are the <i>desiderata</i> which the noble Earl has put before the House? I think he claims that the House should not be un-wieldly in its numbers; that every member of it should feel it his duty to assist in the government of the country; and that such duty should neither be illsuited nor irksome to him. The noble Viscount said just now that your Lordships first of all committed homicide on the Budget, and then proposed to commit suicide yourselves. Well, how many noble Lords opposite voted for the Finance Bill? I think the Dumber was seventy-five. I defy any one to propose any scheme for the reduction of the Members of this House that would not leave more than seventy-five of those who voted against the Finance Bill of last year. I think that is a sufficient answer to the suggestion that the proposals of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches means the suicide of this House.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl suggests that the House should be constituted, or a part of it, on some popular basis, but I rejoice to think that the basis which the noble Earl suggests is the basis of this House as it exists. His historical review I will not add to, because I do not think it can be improved, or that anything better can be said in favour of it; but of this I am quite certain, that one of the most valuable institutions in the whole of this country is the Peerage of England. I say that because I believe membership of it is the greatest incentive to good public work in this country. My Lords, after all what do most of us desire? We desire to be thought well of by our fellow men, and I venture to think, in whatever walk of life, whether it be science or whether it be politics,
<col>186</col>
that a seat in your Lordships' House is looked upon as the greatest of honours and therefore as the greatest incentive to public work in this country. I should greatly deprecate anything which, by bringing in too great an infusion from outside, would destroy the character of this House. This is not the moment to go into any detailed suggestions for the reform of your Lordships' House. That will come by-and-by when you have disposed of the Resolutions that are on the Paper and consider the further Resolutions which the noble Earl will propose. When that time comes I shall venture to hope that it may not be impossible to put before your Lordships a scheme by which, while maintaining the character of this House&#x2014;that is to say, maintaining it as a House of Lords, a House of Peers&#x2014;it may be possible to submit some members of it to the opinion of their fellow men outside, so to get that current of fresh air and that contact with opinion outside this House which the noble Earl desires.<lb/>
My Lords, I was sorry the noble Earl did not make any reference to what, I think, is a question which actuates a very large number of members of your Lordships' House as well as the public outside, and that is the possibility of bringing into this House some representation of the great Dominions overseas. The noble Earl pointed out to your Lordships how the proposals to emasculate this House might be received by these great Dominions, but he did not give us any hint or suggestion as to how he thought we might include them. I do not think there will be any difficulty in inducing your Lordships to make this House more of an Imperial House than it is at present. My belief is that the difficulty lies on the other side of the water, and I should greatly hope that the result of the Motion which the noble Earl has moved and the result of the attention which the subject is securing, not only in this country but throughout the Empire, will lead to some suggestions from overseas as to the manner in which it would be acceptable to those great Dominions to be included in the Second Chamber of this country. What we have to aim at is, above all things, to secure an independent Second Chamber. After all, we do not sit here for our own benefit; we sit here for the benefit of the people of this country, who, I believe, as the noble Earl said, will insist upon having a Second Chamber of some kind or other, such as is possessed by almost every other civilised country in
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0119"/>
<col>187</col>
the world. The House of Lords is the Second Chamber to which England has been accustomed, and with which I believe England will not entirely dispense. It seems to me that, having got a Chamber with the historical associations which surround this Chamber, having got the advantage that we have of the presence here of some of the ablest men in the United Kingdom and a few from the Dominions overseas, it would be madness to cast it aside and attempt to construct an entirely novel and different Senate. I sincerely hope your Lordships will be very careful in departing in any degree from the principles upon which this Chamber is at present constituted. I do not say that it is impossible to find means by which it might be altered and improved, but I do believe that in the opinion of the majority of the people of this country the Peerage ought always to continue to be the basis of the Second Chamber. The object which we have in view is the safe and continuous development of the institutions of the country. We want to get an Assembly which possesses patriotism, common sense, and, above all, independence; and I do not despair that, when your Lordships go into Committtee on this subject, you will be able to evolve a scheme which will commend itself to the people and be accepted by them in preference to the proposals of His Majesty's Government to deprive your Lordships of those powers which alone make it Worth while to sit in any Second Chamber at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00626"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech of the noble Viscount, I think, laid him rather open to the <i>tu quoque</i> reply upon several points. For instance, I entirely agree with him when he quoted the great difficulties which attended the concoction of a Second Chamber; but the moral I drew from it was that that made it all the more improbable that we should see any of these misty reforms of the Second Chamber which have been vaguely shadowed forth. Then, again, the noble Viscount said that the proposal which the noble Earl made was in the nature of a move against the other House. Well, the noble Earl's proposal would lead to the reduction of the Conservative majority in this House and the abrogation of the hereditary principle, and if that is what the noble Viscount considers an attack upon the Liberal Party I think he is somewhat hard to please. Again, the noble Viscount urged my noble friend, Lord Rosebery, not to overdo a
<col>188</col>
Single Chamber. I only hope His Majesty's Government will follow that wise advice; but our apprehension is that it is not the First Chamber which is overdoing itself.<lb/>
The noble Viscount taunted us with what he called the transformation scene. Well, my Lords, we are not the only Party who have effected a transformation scene, for I seem to recall a statement of His Majesty's present advisers that when the new Parliament was elected it would be a case of Budget first and other measures afterwards. We do not hear very much about the Budget nowadays, but we are aware of obvious reasons why that measure is hung up. However, I did not rise for the purpose of making a very imperfect reply to the noble Viscount's speech, but just to recall to the recollection rather of the public than of members of this House that, whatever may be the upshot of the Resolutions of the noble Earl, there is no possible basis of agreement between the two political Parties in the two Houses of Parliament upon this question of the House of Lords. The noble Viscount said that in the able and exhaustive speech of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, the fringe of the question had not even been touched. If that is the view of His Majesty's Ministers it is perfectly obvious that no amount of discussion on our part can lead to the adoption of a measure which will find favour on both sides of the House. Therefore an early appeal to the supreme arbitrators, the electorate, would appear to be inevitable.<lb/>
I think we may comfort ourselves with the reflection that we shall go into the battle with the possibility of gaining, but with the knowledge that we cannot be worse off if we lose. We undoubtedly ran the very serious risk that the attack which is now being framed would be made upon this Chamber if we persisted last year in referring the Budget to the country. That attack has now come, and we must meet it as best we can, with the knowledge that, even if we fail, we can be no worse off than if we sit down quietly. We are doomed to political extinction by His Majesty's present Government, or, at all events, to such a measure of what we consider political extinction that we would risk all rather than submit to it. I imagine I am speaking the views of the great majority of noble Lords when I say that we are irreconcilably opposed to the principle that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0120"/>
<col>189</col>
it shall be in the power of the other House of Parliament to force through any measure within the limits of a single Parliament, irrespective of any appeal to the electors of the country. I admit it is possible that the Government may succeed in passing a Statute which would place this House in the position they wish to see it occupy. I conceive that it is possible that, rather than run such extravagant risks as the swamping of this Chamber by the creation of 400 Peers, your Lordships might prefer to accept the situation and allow the Government to pass such a measure.<lb/>
Then I would remind His Majesty's Ministers that, although one man may lead a horse to the water, twenty cannot make it drink. It would be quite impossible for them to continue with a Second Chamber the vast majority of which would probably decline to go through the farce of attending debates or criticising measures over the ultimate fate of which they would have no control. The necessary result of that, I take it, would be that this House as a House would have to be ended and a Second Chamber of a different kind constituted. We are told that that Second Chamber, if it is to be created at all, is to be created on a broad democratic basis and chosen by a large body of electors. As the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, put it, is it likely that any man in whom the country would be likely to have confidence would go through all the trouble and expense of getting elected to a Second Chamber unless that Second Chamber were to have at least as large powers as this House at present possesses. I do not, therefore, see that His Majesty's Government would gain all the advantages anticipated should they succeed in reducing the House of Lords to the very humble position which they wish to assign to it in the future. The question, then, comes whether we are not making a very real, substantial, and reasonably liberal proposal by the suggested limitation&#x2014;I will own that I have looked forward to a considerable limitation&#x2014;of the number of Peers in this House, and by the abrogation of the hereditary principle. It seems to me that in addition much good would result from the infusion of a considerable number of life Peers. I think that in addition to the limitation of our numbers and the creation of a considerable number of life Peers it might, under certain circumstances, be possible to arrange, in cases of disputed Bills of first-class importance,
<col>190</col>
for a joint conference of the two Houses sitting, and perhaps voting, together.<lb/>
I am not disposed to give unlimited acquiescence to Lord Rosebery's suggestion as to the electoral body by which the House of Lords should be chosen in future. I am still less disposed to favour the idea that a portion of the reformed House of Lords should be taken from the old members and a portion from outside. I think it would be much better that the whole body should be chosen either by the present House or by such outside body as may be determined upon. I am also inclined to doubt whether it would be well to lay down as a positive enactment that nobody should be eligible to a place in the reformed House of Lords unless he had held certain offices. I think that would be putting the younger members of the House in rather an invidious position. I also share the opinion that those noble Lords who might be deprived of seats in this Chamber under a system of reform should be able to present themselves as candidates for the Lower House. And, lastly, I should say I think in a reformed Upper House some system of providing for the representation of the minority would undoubtedly have to be introduced, so that the Liberal element should have its fair share of representation in this House.<lb/>
One remark which has been made may, I think, be worth elucidating a little further&#x2014;that is the remark made by the late Lord Salisbury as to the circumstances under which this House would cease to be so largely composed of members of one political Party. I dare say some of your Lordships remember as well as I do that it has only been within the last forty years that one Party has gradually assumed ascendancy in this House. I can recollect the time of a great division&#x2014;I think in 1863&#x2014;when a very full poll was taken of the House of Lords; of the Peers voting the Liberal Party, the Government of the day had an actual majority, and it was only by bringing up the proxies which then existed that the late Lord Derby secured a majority of Dine. That shows that the House of Lords has not always been in the past a Tory preserve, and that it acquired its present political complexion simply through the extraordinary rapidity with which Radical legislation has progressed and forced many moderate Liberals, not to desert their Liberal principles, but to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0121"/>
<col>191</col>
join, perforce, that camp from which they were least divided. I do not wish to go into detail as to further proposals. There are certain reasons why I cannot agree with Lord Onslow as to the advisability of including representatives from the oversea Dominions, but that and other details I reserve for further consideration. I would express my general hearty concurrence with the noble Earl who has brought forward the Motion, and my general agreement with the greater part of his eloquent speech.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00627"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in listening to the speeches made by noble Lords who have devoted a considerable amount of time and study to this question, it has been brought home to me how difficult it is to introduce changes into this House without running some risk of destroying much that is good. This House has played a part in the history of the kingdom of which it may well be proud. It is no light matter to talk of altering its constitution, and I feel that my connection with this House is of too recent origin to entitle me to put forward my views were it not that we have all had to meet a good deal of hostile criticism during the recent political controversy. If further justification were needed I should find it in the hostility which has been shown to the functions of this House, including the duties of ordinary revision, by Ministers in the House of Commons during the last few years. The sole object of the Government during those years seems to have been to put aside the functions of this House.<lb/>
There may be&#x2014;I fear there is&#x2014;a great difference of opinion between Liberal Ministers and noble Lords on this side of the House as to what are the true functions of the House of Lords; but I certainly think, in regard to its powers of revision, we should be able to expect fairer and more-impartial treatment than that which has been accorded to us. I think a most unfair or, if that word hardly meets the case, a most un statesman like course, has been adopted in regard to many of our Amendments on the ground of breach of privilege. Let us take the Old Age Pensions Act. The clause dealing with disqualification for imprisonment would probably have resulted, as many of your Lordships will remember, in unjust and invidious distinctions in similar cases of offences dealt with by different magistrates. In one case a man might receive a day's imprisonment and find himself disqualified
<col>192</col>
from drawing a pension for ten years. In another case of a similar offence a man might receive a punishment to which no penalty of that nature would be attached. An Amendment was carried in this House to rectify what was evidently a mistake and an injustice by altering the limitation of disqualification for imprisonment to a minimum period of one month; but although it was pointed out in the House of Commons at the time&#x2014;I think by Mr. Keir Hardie&#x2014;that this Amendment would merely remove the possibilities of grave injustice, yet in pursuance of their usual policy towards this House Liberal Ministers insisted on the rejection of that Amendment on the plea of privilege. Under the treatment which was accorded to us on our Amendments of this and of many other Bills it would be clearly impossible for this House to exercise its ordinary duties of discussion or revision on any of those large social measures which come up to us from time to time. For Amendments would frequently vary the charge to some small extent and thereby give the Liberal Government a chance of rejecting such Amendments on the grounds of privilege. There must be some friendly co-operation between the two Houses if we are to get the best legislative results. If the House of Commons desires to accept an Amendment it is always open to it not to insist upon its privilege.<lb/>
But, my Lords, it is not only on questions of privilege that a determined hostility has been shown to this House. Take the Land Tenure Bill, now known as the Agricultural Holdings Act. Perhaps I cannot do better than quote very briefly one passage out of a speech by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"On the attitude of the Government towards our Amendments, I observe the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture took credit for his friends in the House of Commons that they did not reject our Amendments <i>en bloc</i>. As fifty-five out of seventy-one were inserted by His Majesty's Ministers themselves, to say nothing of twelve other Amendments to which they assented, I think it is straining the imagination a good deal to conceive that the whole of the Amendments could have been dealt with in that summary fashion."</quote>
My Lords, further comment on my part as to the attitude of the Government is unnecessary. Have Liberal Ministers shown any desire to accept anything from this House which may tend to its credit in the eyes of the country? Their policy has been one of "filling up the cup," and when an
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0122"/>
<col>193</col>
election draws near, when as a discredited Party they see their hopes of retaining office ever growing fainter, they attack the House of Lords as the best means of obtaining public favour and to help them at the polls. For this reason, if for no other, I would support any measure of reform which would help to strengthen this House and enable it to carry out its duties to the nation in a more efficient manner.<lb/>
But although I agree that it is necessary, for the reasons I have given, to strengthen this Chamber and relieve it of those disabilities which at present form the stock-in-trade of every demagogue in the country, I think the real reason why we should take this action is that I believe there is a sincere desire on the part of the nation for some measure of reform of this House. I believe there is a feeling among the more thoughtful members of our community, a feeling which has been growing for years, that certain anomalies in the constitution of this House should be removed, that the accident of birth unaccompanied by other qualifications should not of itself entitle any man to a seat in this House. The fact that there are a certain number of Peers who have not got the time or the inclination to attend to their legislative duties and who yet exercise their right to vote on the somewhat rare occasions when they attend this House, is not only an anomaly, but is a distinct source of weakness to the House. But as the constitution of the House of Lords is already based partly on the system of heredity and partly on the system of selection, I hope it may be possible to extend the system of selection to the hereditary element. I mention selection and not election in contradiction to the noble Earl who initiated this discussion, because I cannot conceive any fully-elected House being in a position to carry out its difficult duties as a Second Chamber.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00629"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I am not opposed to some elective element being introduced, but if any portion of the hereditary Peers are to be elected I think it would probably be wiser to have them elected by their fellow Peers or by one of the two Houses of Parliament. At present this House has an independent character which I would like to see maintained. It is removed from the
<col>194</col>
fluctuations of political feeling and does not depend on any man's vote. At present it cannot be forced by any one section of the community to pass a measure at the expense of the remainder. These are very valuable qualities, how valuable one can only judge when one looks at the discreditable political bargaining which often takes place between factions in the House of Commons, and which I am not sure is not now taking place in that House.<lb/>
What is the attitude of the Government in regard to this question of reform? I have not yet understood what their attitude is. I think many noble Lords on both sides of this House would welcome a statement by the Leader of the House as to the position the Cabinet now take up in regard to this question. Do the Government, or do they not, intend ever to bring forward any proposals for its reform? I am glad to see that they or at least their representatives in this House do not question the efficiency with which noble Lords transact the business of this House. I believe myself that the Government's chief objection is to the efficiency with which many noble Lords bring expert criticism to bear on many Ministerial measures. When Lord Newton moved the Second Reading of his Bill some three years ago the noble Earl opposite, the Leader of the House, boycotted the discussion on the ground of partiality. He informed your Lordships on this side of the House that, belonging to the Unionist Party, you dealt with measures of the Liberal Government in a Party spirit. I would like, with all due respect, to deny the impeachment, which hardly tallies with the statements of Liberal Ministers who have been recently going about taking a great deal of credit to themselves for the extraordinary amount of useful legislation which has found its way on the Statute Book in the last few years.<lb/>
The noble Earl also admitted on that occasion that no reform of this House, no matter what distinguished men of impartial views were introduced, would ever produce a majority in this House in favour of the measures to which we are at present apparently offering an insuperable barrier. Our partiality, in fact, consists in our insistence on certain principles; in maintaining the unity of the Empire; in securing to parents the right to have their children educated in the faith in which they were brought up; in objecting to unfair burdens being placed in a vindic-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0123"/>
<col>195</col>
tive manner on a particular trade or section of the community, and, finally, in referring a Budget to the people, who have fully vindicated our action by returning to the House of Commons a majority of representatives opposed to that measure. I know it is possible and it is one of the drawbacks to our Parliamentary system that a section of those representatives may yet be bribed by some measure of Home Rule into supporting a measure which otherwise they would heartily condemn, but even in that case our action has been fully vindicated by the country. In fact, the possibility of such a bargain being struck in the House of Commons is surely only one more proof of the absolute, necessity for maintaining a strong and efficient Second Chamber. Mr. Redmond recently asserted, at a public dinner, that the main issue on which the last election was fought was not the Budget but Home Rule for Ireland, and that the result of the election was a majority in favour of Home Rule. I do not question the truth of what Mr. Redmond said. I only question how many electors outside Ireland realised the issue on which they were voting. It is said our House is not representative; but who are the representatives of the million of people in Ireland who are bitterly opposed to Home Rule and of the millions of electors of England, Scotland, and Wales who were apparently misled as to the issue of the last General Election? I think every fair-minded man in the country would say it is the Second Chamber.<lb/>
But, my Lords, the anomalies which do undoubtedly exist in this House are a great source of weakness. They were used with considerable effect at the last General Election, not only to discredit our action but to blind the people as to the real nature of the demands made by the Government in regard to the limitation of the powers of this House. I doubt very much if many people understood in the least what those demands were. If any elector asked Mr. Asquith when he was on the public platform if he were in favour of the Second Chamber, the answer was always "Yes." I wish the electors had gone a step further and asked if the Second Chamber was to have any power to appeal from the Government to the country. What answer would he have given? I have no doubt he would have delivered a clever and lengthy peroration which neither his questioner nor anyone
<col>196</col>
could have understood. But at the next General Election a plain, straightforward answer will be demanded to the question, and the Government policy will be shown to be a deliberate attempt to gain autocratic power for the Cabinet of the day to pass what measures they choose and to prevent the people having any voice in the legislation of the country. When this is put before the people as a clear issue they will realise that, reformed or unreformed, the House of Lords is the only safeguard they have against such rule.<lb/>
This, however, does not affect the issue before us. Our action must not be based on expediency, but upon the wishes of the people. I believe there is a growing conviction among the electors of the country that some reform in the composition of this House is desirable, and I also believe that in carrying out some readjustment of the House to modern conditions it should be possible to link up the House of Lords, with all its great traditions, more closely yet in the sympathies of the people. I venture to hope, my Lords, that you will support the broad principles contained in the Resolutions of the noble Earl. The principle of the third Resolution is, I think, a necessary preliminary to any reform. Without it, in face of the misrepresentation we have to meet, we should not be able to retain the confidence of the country, and without that confidence we could not have a strong and efficient Second Chamber.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00631"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who spoke in favour of and advocated the reform of this House five-and-twenty years ago, I heartily support the Motion of the noble Earl. It is probable enough that there are not many who desire to see a single-Chamber Government in this country, or rather who dare to assert in so many words that that is their wish; but there seem to be a great many who would prefer to have a House of Lords possessing no greater power than that of merely putting in drafting Amendments or of correcting grammatical errors which have been unnoticed on Report in the other House. I believe, however, that the great majority of the people of this country desire to have a genuine and effective Second Chamber not less strong or effective than those which have been set up in the Australian Commonwealth and the South African Union, and one which, while
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0124"/>
<col>197</col>
able to resist democracy if it goes mad, shall be so constituted as to be in sympathy with modern developments and aspirations, and so composed that its criticisms shall command in any case attention and respect if not acquiescence.<lb/>
The noble Viscount who followed Lord Rosebery rather made game of him on account of Mr. Balfour's enumeration of the points with regard to which the House of Commons in this country was always the predominant partner of the two Houses of Parliament, but unless I am very much mistaken there is hardly any one of those points in respect to which the representative Chamber in every country in the world and in all our own Colonies is not likewise predominant. I do not think there can be any self-governing community of any sort or kind in which the House of Representatives does not hold the power of the purse, which after all, is the mainspring of the Government of every country. Single Chamber Government, although condemned by the custom of the whole civilised world, would after all, be better than an omnipotent House of Commons subject in name, but in name only, to an impotent House of Lords, for if we had the misfortune to have only one Chamber, that Chamber having full responsibility for its actions, would be likely to be more careful of what it passed into law than the House of Commons is at present. We know well enough that it often occurs in the House of Commons that Members who thoroughly dislike a particular Bill vote for it in obedience to the Party Whip, relying on its being dealt with up here; while at the same time they exercise their privilege of abusing the House of Lords for doing that which in their inmost hearts they desired.<lb/>
We had an example of that not long ago in connection with the Bight Hours Bill. It is notorious that the majorities by which that Bill passed the House of Commons did not by any means represent the feelings of the House of Commons towards it, and we only passed it here, in the words of Lord Lansdowne, with great misgivings, but feeling, notwithstanding our doubts, that the Government was ready to assume responsibility with regard to it. It is notorious that many of the criticisms passed upon that measure have since proved themselves to be only too well founded. It seems to me that there must be something wrong either with the composition of this House if a measure which undoubtedly commanded a
<col>198</col>
great deal of popular support outside was practically without friends here, or else there must be something wrong with our position in the machinery of government if, after thinking that the measure was full of imperfections, we were unable to remit it for further consideration. The truth is, I am afraid, that we only passed that Bill because, in plain English, we thought there would be trouble if we did not, and because unfortunately the public is only too apt to discount any criticisms which are made here by attributing to them, unjustly enough, an undercurrent of self-interest.<lb/>
The worst enemies of this House do not deny that the de-bates here reach a very high level, and that great questions are worthily discussed, but there is no doubt that those who opposed the Budget in the country at the late Election were seriously handicapped by the fact that it had been remitted to the constituencies by the action of the House of Lords. The People's Budget was not exactly fortunate in the country. The constituencies who returned the gentlemen who voted by a majority of 230 in its favour on Third Reading have only returned a majority of about the odd thirty in favour of it now, and, if the Irish Members are justified in their boast that they won for the Government as many as twenty seats in Lancashire and Yorkshire, that odd thirty in favour of the People's Budget would be represented in fact by a minus quantity. But the fact that we rejected it undoubtedly told largely in its favour, especially in Scotland and in the North. We do not get the credit for rejecting things on their merits; yet what is wanted undoubtedly in the country, as I believe, is a strong Second Chamber capable of steadying public opinion, of giving the demagogues time to talk themselves out, and so constituted that the weight of its criticisms shall not be lessened by any disparagement of the channel through which they may be delivered. In these circumstances, it seems to me that boldness will be the true statesmanship, and that we ought not to be afraid to make drastic changes in the constitution of this House.<lb/>
My Lords, this is not yet the time to discuss possible changes in detail, but I venture to think we can best seek for guidance in the systems adopted in our great self-governing Colonies beyond the seas, and in the balances of power which are found to work well in those democratic communities. Those sys-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0125"/>
<col>199</col>
tems vary in detail almost everywhere, but two or three general rules appear to underlie them all. The Council or the Upper House is about half the strength of the Lower House. The members of it, if not nominated for life, are elected for a term at least equal to twice the legitimate duration of a Parliament, and the electors, with one important exception, are chosen on a very much higher franchise than those who elect the Lower House. Moreover, in the latest Constitutions, at any rate, and the most important ones&#x2014;those framed within the last ten years, the Australian Commonwealth and the South African Union&#x2014;there are careful provisions made for deadlocks between the two Houses, whether on general legislation or on matters of finance. I believe that the best solution of the present difficulties will be found in taking example from what has been proved to answer well across the seas. It is likely enough that, for a period at any rate, the best solution may be found in a combination of the methods of co-optation and nomination and election, but I believe that if we are to have a permanent system and one which will not need to be revised within a limited period, it will be wise to arrange that the great majority of the members of the future Second Chamber of this country should be chosen by indirect election from outside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00632"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to follow the noble Lord who has just spoken into the constitution and methods of electing Second Chambers abroad or in the Colonies. Even if I wished to I should not be able to, but at all events I may say that I listened with great interest to what he had to tell us about the plans which are pursued in those parts of the world. I am very much interested, however, about the whole question of the Second Chamber here, so I will confine myself entirely to those considerations. It is a good many years now since I came into the House of Lords. Although perhaps not the oldest, I have probably been a member of this House as long as anybody present to-night. I took my seat in 1877, on the same day as Lord Beaconsfield, though I recognise that this has nothing to do with the matters we are to consider to-night. I also remember that in my hotter youth I was something of a reformer myself, and I remember, like a nightmare, addressing your Lordships' House in an endeavour to give expression to my own ideas on that subject, those ideas
<col>200</col>
being that nobody should be allowed to vote unless he had attended sittings of the House a certain number of times. The noble Marquess, the late Lord Salisbury, was Leader of the House at that time, and much to our regret he was absent from indisposition. On that occasion I received a tremendous castigation from Lord Cranbrook, and I was congratulated by all my friends that this unfortunate circumstance had kept Lord Salisbury away or I should probably have got it much worse than I did.<lb/>
The other reason why I should like to say something to-night is that I was a member of the Rosebery Commitee. I propose to say very little about that, and I do not, I daresay to your relief, mean to say anything about Oliver Cromwell either. Oliver Cromwell slept for two nights in my house at home. I assure you I am very proud of that fact. But, after all, when we come to bring Oliver Cromwell into our considerations to-night, it is just as well to remember a characterisation of him by one of our great historians&#x2014;that Oliver Cromwell could govern neither with nor without Parliaments. Under those circumstances I do not know that we need trouble very much about what he would have thought or said or done with regard to the matters which are occupying us now. I am sure that everybody in the House will join with me in expressing to Lord Rosebery how much we have been interested in the speech he delivered to us, and I think we all recognise his high patent to advise us in the contingencies which surround us. But I hope he will not think that I am out on a freebooting expedition if I rather question the opportuneness and the present advantage of the course that he recommends to the House. And here I find myself in quite unexpected agreement with the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, below me. On this question of advantage I address myself, for the moment especially to the Opposition Peers and the Cross Benches, and particularly to those who are acting with the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, though I have no notion who they are or whether they include the noble Marquess opposite, or what I will call the official Opposition Bench. I dare say later in the evening, when we hear someone from the Front Opposition Bench, we shall be illuminated as to how far the mover of the Resolutions to-night and the Front Opposition Bench are in complete accord with regard to the opportuneness of the motion.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0126"/>
<col>201</col>
It is quite unnecessary, of course, for me to trouble about what noble Lords below me think or what their official or semi-official supporters think. I remember quite well when Lord Crewe, with that gift of lucid and fair exposition of which he is a master, explained to the House the exact nature of the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions. I understood from him then that he acquiesced to the last jot and tittle in the degree of nullity which those Resolutions established. I will go back for a moment, then, to the reasons why I think that, tactically speaking, apart perhaps, from any lofty principle, the moment for what we are considering to-night is not felicitously chosen. I think if we are going to discuss this question for four nights, as I believe is the case, it is inevitable that the discussion will reveal a great many divergences of opinion, a great many confessions of what may be indefensible, or thought indefensible, a great many suggestions of compromises, a recognition of Strength here and of weakness there, and that in the process, whilst outside this House we may lose our friends, I think it is quite certain that we shall retain our enemies. The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, may say, in the same spirit that Lord Camperdown applied to the Budget, that if that is so he does not care; and I am sure he does not care, because he thinks it is right, and I quite recognise that he is the person who has the best right to advise us on it.<lb/>
But really, speaking for myself, much as I am prepared to defer to his experience, I do feel a little uncomfortable about the moment chosen. I think if we could have waited for what Lord Rosebery described as the Cleopatra-like procession of Resolutions in the House of Commons, it is more than likely that events would have occurred which would have made the Government, I do not quite like to say ridiculous, but would have made them appear in not quite as strong a position as when they started on the operation. I have every confidence in the Leader of the Opposition in the other House to make the very most of any material for the defence of our position and of attack on the Government's position which it may be possible to make, and I think that all this would have been watched with lynx eyes by the noble Marquess opposite and by a great many observant critics who are sitting here. Then when our turn came it seems to me that we should have found ourselves, or noble Lords opposite would have found themselves, equipped with material, whether
<col>202</col>
for attack of the Government's Resolutions or for defence of our own position, which would have been invaluable, and which I am afraid the course of this Debate may not give them here. And in that connection a Latin adage occurs to me which is not a bad one, although I believe it comes out of a Latin grammar&#x2014;"<i>Fas est ab hoste doceri.</i>"<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I pass to Lord Rosebery's first and second Resolutions, which affirm the necessity of an efficient Second Chamber. In, I think, the best political novel in our language, "Coningsby," Mr. Milbanke, while talking to Coningsby, declared, in 1834, that&#x2014;
<quote>"nobody wants a Second Chamber except a few disreputable individuals."</quote>
That is not the view taken here, or, indeed, outside in 1910. We have just heard from Lord Morley that the Cabinet is like adamant about a Second Chamber. So that we may agree that what Mr. Milbanke thought in 1834 is not what His Majesty's Ministers think in 1910. Another thing which Mr. Milbanke said was that he never heard of a Peer with ancient lineage. Whether he was right or wrong about that, such lineage as we do possess and such legislative rights as it has given us, and gives us at the present moment, are, I understand, all to disappear under these Resolutions. But, be that as it may, it is quite clear that these are days when everybody thinks a Second Chamber is wanted. We live in days when Parliament is always being urged, even goaded, to interfere in many matters, and to render and to undertake services which have never previously been attempted. Interference by the State between labour and capital, with regard to freedom of contract, supply and demand, and so on, is recognised and practised by both Parties. It is not a question how to interfere, but only of how much to interfere, that is always the ground of controversy. This points, of course, to the necessity affirmed by Lord Rosebery's Resolution. I am not going into any academic elaboration on single or second Chambers. I would only point out that, whatever the rights or wrongs of single Chambers may be, when noble Lords opposite are in office we do live practically under single Chamber government and nothing very terrible seems to happen. My only explanation of that is that Mr. Walter Long and Mr. Chaplin must be looked upon by the general public as less formidable customers than Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston Churchill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0127"/>
<col>203</col>
Now, my Lords, I come to the third Resolution as to the hereditary principle. Well, I am afraid, with all its imperfections and its virtues on its head, the hereditary principle appears to have gone by the board, or perhaps it would be better to say that it has been jetisoned. It is quite true that in the very early deliberations of the Rosebery Committee, everybody on that Committee came to the conclusion that that principle had to go. But where, I think, it really suffered most was in what I may call, perhaps, the perambulating oratory of the crisis Peers. The Rosebery Committee cheerfully affirmed a self-denying ordinance on the part of a very large number of persons who had not been consulted in the matter; in fact, I do not know that had they been consulted they would have agreed. I do not know that I should if I was one of them, but, anyhow, what we understand by the Anti-Budget Crusade gave that position away, and very effectually. Theoretically England, disposed, as it may be, to maintain existing institutions, is becoming, and very naturally becoming, suspicious that the hereditary basis for a Second Chamber is indefensible, and that it is no longer held to be defensible by the people who are most concerned, you would think, in maintaining the hereditary principle. We have yet to see what practical England, as opposed to theoretical England, will say about it.<lb/>
As we have heard to-night, the ultimate appeal in this matter must be to the electorate. Speaking for myself, my own predilections are in favour of the House of Lords as I have known it, and of the House of Lords as I have seen it. I am afraid about these very ambitious schemes of reform. Gaily as I started in early life, I am becoming rather a waverer now. The noble Viscount below me will correct me if I am wrong, but I think it was Voltaire who said&#x2014;
<quote>"Before you set about remedying the disorders of a State, it is well to study and consider the character of the people."</quote>
I submit that the House of Lords, to a very considerable extent, does understand the character, not, perhaps, of a Radical House of Commons, but the character of the commons of England, and I also submit that the commons of England, though they may often disapprove of us and often be provoked with us, on the whole understand the House of Lords pretty well. Anyhow, whether I am right or wrong on a long survey of that, I venture to say
<col>204</col>
that within the last twenty years&#x2014;since Home Rule&#x2014;the House of Lords have been more in sympathy with the commons of England than the House of Commons. When the noble Marquess opposite, advised you to take the line and to act in the way suggested on the Budget&#x2014;and needless to say, you did so act on his advice&#x2014;I thought you were wrong. I personally did not like it at all, and I do not like now, the feeling of the House of Commons forcing a Dissolution on Supply; but I am bound to say that the noble Marquess took very strong ground, and that that ground was made stronger by the many people who supported him; and I think that what the noble Viscount below me called the exorbitant pretensions of the House of Lords in acting in the way they did about the Budget was, perhaps, a little overstatement of the case. But, be that as it may, the assassins at all events have not committed suicide, and I only hope that we are not going to put our hands or minds to anything of that sort now. I rather deprecate an <i>auto da fe</i> of any sort before you are obliged to make your confession, and that is why, as I said at the beginning, I am a little nervous and uncomfortable about the particular line we have taken or are being invited to take to-night.<lb/>
My Lords, I have only one more word to say about a Second Chamber, I quite understand, if you are going to reform this Chamber, that reform, except to strengthen, would seem a mischievous contradiction in terms. But my whole feeling is against a very strong Second Chamber in the acute and extended democracy under which we live. I am entirely with the noble Marquess in what he said about the Second Chamber and democracy, which was read out by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, to-night&#x2014;that, pushed to logical issues, after all, we all know that a Second Chamber system must be a deadlock system; and I should personally be extremely sorry to see popular liberties represented in and by a House of Commons arrayed against equal rights and claims set up by the House of Lords or the Second Chamber. I really do feel that unbending virtue and unyielding virtue is about the most formidable thing we can create in a Second Chamber, having regard to the character and the whole complexion of English politics in their representation as we now understand it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0128"/>
<col>205</col>
In conclusion, my Lords, I should like to advance a plea for a little patience. The history of the House of Lords in its relations with the House of Commons is, after all, a history of adjustment. You had adjustments in 1407, 1671, 1678, and 1860. I quite agree that those were adjustments on Money Bills which were preceded by resolution. But, after all, we do not quite know what the Government are going to propose in this way. I know the noble Earl examined Lord Morley on it, and I am not sure that he got quite a satisfactory answer from him. But, at all events, when the noble Earl received the answer, which, as I say, I do not think was a satisfactory one, he got up and said that in fact he need not have asked the question because we know what it is&#x2014;it is the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions. But is it the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions? Because after all, whether we admire the Government or whether we do not, it is a Government which is a little, what Horace would call, <i>ventosus</i>. It is certainly capable of chops and changes, and I do not think it would be far wrong for any of us to say that, although the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions are supposed to hold the field, when the Resolutions we are asked to consider actually come up here they will not be exactly the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions. But, my Lords, that is only my own view. It is quite possible that they may be worse than those Resolutions. It is also quite possible that, for all kinds of reasons which occur to me but which I will not trouble you with, they may be very diluted Bannerman Resolutions, and they may supply a basis which we should be quite willing to consider and see whether by compromises, or concessions, perhaps, here and there, we might not find room for a new constitutional understanding, and so carry on without anything very heroic. At all events, speaking for myself, I do not care very much about mortgaging my freedom or in any way embarrassing my rights of consideration by going into anything very detailed or very substantive until I have seen what the Government are going to propose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00633"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it would be very difficult to exaggerate the importance of the discussion in which we are engaged, for upon it, or upon the issue that takes place upon it, depend the steadiness of the legislative machine of the country and the security of obtaining the considered
<col>206</col>
wishes of the electorate of the country, and of seeing that they prevail. It is worth while, perhaps, considering what should be the exact quality of the Chamber for carrying out such duties. First of all, I should say that the great essence in that quality should be independence and freedom from the pressure of perpetual election; secondly, that it should be in touch with local feeling in different parts of the country; and, thirdly, it should preserve as far as possible, as was laid down by the Committee over which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches presided, the fabric and position of the House of Lords in the Constitution.<lb/>
We are sometimes told that Peers should not of their hereditary right sit or vote in your Lordships' House. I agree that there are certain Peers who for various reasons are unable to take their due part and share in the work of your Lordships' House, but that could surely be remedied quite simply by a system of election by their fellow Peers, which system formed part of the recommendations of the Committee over which the noble Earl presided. That principle was accepted by the Committee, and I do hope that it will form a very considerable part of any scheme of reform of which your Lordships may approve. But I trust also that we may see beyond this a considerable number of Peers who have sat in your Lordships' House some of them for many years. Many of them have done great service to the State, and I think it would be very desirable that a large proportion of those should be allowed to sit as qualified Peers owing to their services to the State. The noble Earl this evening, in his most able speech, told us two things. Speaking of the hereditary principle, he said that the hereditary principle had outlived its usefulness, and he went on to add that it had ceased to work well in practice, but I noticed that the noble Earl said not one Word to justify either of those statements. He made them as broad sweeping statements&#x2014;that the hereditary principle had outlived its usefulness and had ceased to work well in practice.<lb/>
My Lords, I think that a charge of that kind, broad and sweeping as it is, might have been worth a few words of explanation as to how this system has ceased to work well in practice and as to how it has outlived its usefulness. I venture to take a very different view of the hereditary principle of your Lordships' House, and to assert that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0129"/>
<col>207</col>
that principle has been no failure. I believe it has been of great value to the State. The great mass of those who are hereditary Peers are men who have trained themselves to know what their duties would be in order to bring themselves into a position to carry out those duties effectively and for the good of the State. And, my Lords, many and many a Peer who takes no very active part in politics, who is not a professed politician, is of enormous value in the councils of the State. He is a man who lives at home, who is respected at home, who knows his country and his fellow countrymen, and when that man comes to Parliament he comes imbued with a knowledge of his fellow countrymen and free from the bias of Party politicians, and he brings into the councils of the nation a weight which it would be very difficult to replace. It is very easy to sweep away what you have got, but it is very difficult indeed to be certain that you will replace it with anything better or even as good.<lb/>
At an earlier part of this evening one of the noble Lords who addressed your Lordships&#x2014;I think it was Lord Rosebery&#x2014;spoke of the great services done by hereditary Peers in the past. If anyone will look up the record of the services of hereditary Peers in your Lordships' House in the past, either as Leaders of the House or as holders of high office under the Crown, I think he will find the services of hereditary Peers very difficult indeed to match in any other class or rank of life in this country. Therefore, my Lords, I do hope that in any reform which your Lordships may approve you will retain a very considerable body of hereditary Peers in this House, whether they are qualified by past services to the State or by election by their fellow Peers. We are told, and I do not deny it may be true, that under the pressure of a movement in the country it may be necessary to resort to some extent at all events&#x2014;and there are many views as to the extent it should be resorted to&#x2014;to an elective element from outside your Lordships' House. That may be so, but in dealing with this matter I do venture to suggest that great care should be taken. We have to guard very carefully against several dangers in this respect. I am not saying that I am averse to the proposal, but I do see in it grave dangers unless great care is taken in respect to how it is carried out.<lb/>
In the first place, we have to watch with the greatest care the independence of those whom you bring in from outside. If they
<col>208</col>
are to be subjected to election like ordinary Members of Parliament I do not think you can possibly say that they will have the same independence as life Peers or hereditary Peers. You have other dangers to guard against if you establish nothing but an elective system, which I understand is the view of some of the members of His Majesty's Government. I understand that some of the members of His Majesty's Government have stated distinctly and clearly that in their view a strong Second Chamber is required and that that Chamber should be an elected one. I do not say that that is the view of the whole of His Majesty's Government, because I think it would be very difficult to find any one subject upon which they were united in opinion; but I do not think it will be denied that that proposal has been put forward by a leading member of the Government. But, my Lords, if you adopt that plan, how are you going to guard against the danger, and the grave danger, too, of setting up practically two Houses which would be much the same as the present House of Commons? Does anyone know, if anything of that kind is done&#x2014;and I am quoting it as being recommended by a leading member of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;how it will be possible to guard against a very strong Second Chamber indeed, such as has been denounced so vigorously by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India to-night? You must have one thing or the other. You must have either a strong Chamber based upon the hereditary system, or you must have a strong Chamber based upon the elective system; but the moment you get a predominance of the elective system you surely must take great pains and great care to guard against its competing unduly and unwisely with the House of Commons. The noble Viscount told us several things. He told us that before the election it was contended that this House was everything that was fair and reasonable and proper, but that now, after the election is over it was as little of a decent revising Chamber as possible. I am not sure whom the noble Viscount was quoting, and I should like to know who has said that the present House of Lords is as little of a decent revising Chamber as possible, because those were the words the noble Viscount used.</membercontribution></p>

<col>209</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00635"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: Then I take it as being a quotation by the noble Viscount from the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00636"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Not a quotation; a representation of what the noble Earl said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00637"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: Very well, I will take it as a representation of the noble Earl's speech, although I am bound to say I noticed nothing in the speech of the noble Earl to justify such a representation. What happened at the General Election was this. I do not charge the noble Viscount with it, because I am sure he would not do it himself. But a good many of his colleagues, in the course of the last election, denounced your Lordships' House pretty soundly, chiefly on the ground of its hereditary character. "Why allow these hereditary Peers to interfere with us?" "What right have they to trample upon the people?" and so forth. And when that is answered by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches suggesting, "We will modify the hereditary system; we will modify the hereditary position of the House of Lords; we will try and leaven it with outside election; we will eliminate from the hereditary Peers those who do not want to serve or cannot serve or those who for some physical reason are unfit to serve," what is the reply of the noble Viscount? It is, "We want none of your strengthening of the House of Lords; we will keep you to those things that we have denounced. We will make use of those denunciations in the country for Party purposes; we will keep you as you are and take away your powers." My Lords, I ask&#x2014;Is that fair play? If the denunciations are fair, why block the amendments to get rid of the flaws which you yourselves have been pointing out for your own benefit at the elections? Surely if there are flaws you should be the first to assist in removing them. The Government have denounced them. They have said that our powers are unwise, that they are improper, that we have no business to exercise powers of the kind, and when we want to cure them they say, "No, you keep them," and they will rub the sore in again when the next election comes. I do not think that is a very dignified position to take, but that is the position that is taken now by His Majesty's Government. I should have thought that if there were objections against the House of Lords as a hereditary House, any suggestion to remove those would have been received with open arms by the noble
<col>210</col>
Viscount himself. But the noble Viscount says, "No, I am not going to have the House of Lords strengthened; any strengthening of the House of Lords means an attack upon the House of Commons."<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount passed to the question of the single Chamber and took a view which I am bound to say I have not beard taken before. He told us, "For all important matters you have a single-Chamber Government now." My Lords, if we have a single-Chamber Government now on all important matters, according to the noble Viscount, why all this disturbance about the Veto? Why is the Constitution to be torn up if in all important matters you have got a single Chamber to-day? The noble Viscount was emphatic upon that. He dwelt upon it for some time. But, if so, what becomes of all your attack upon the Veto, if upon every important question you have already got all that you can possibly ask? One is a little inclined to ask what it is the noble Viscount is objecting to in my noble friend Lord Rosebery's Resolutions. His friends tell us that there are many Peers who ought not to be allowed to sit and vote in this House. Does he object to their elimination by the election of Peers in this House by their fellow Peers? The suggestion of my noble friend Lord Rosebery is that certain Peers should sit who have done good service to the State. Does the noble Viscount object to that qualification? The noble Earl suggests that we should get in Peers from outside so as to bring the House into closer touch with the people outside. As far as I know, the noble Viscount objects to every one of those modifications and improvements, and he wishes to leave your Lordships' House in the worst state in which his friends have described it. It does seem to me that the noble Viscount and his colleagues should take one line or the other. They should either drop their attack on the House of Lords because of the defects they find in it, or join hands with those who wish to remove those defects and make the House more in consonance with what his colleagues at ail events have endeavoured to describe it should be.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I think it is worth considering to what extent your Lordships' House in past years has really represented the considered wish of the country. If we
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0131"/>
<col>211</col>
pass back only over the last fifteen years I think we can learn a good deal. We have been told a great deal about the friction that exists between the two Houses, and the noble Viscount talked of the gulf being dug deeper between them. My Lords, is it a gulf between the two Houses that we are dealing with? Is it not rather a gulf between His Majesty's Government and the electors of this country that we are dealing with? Let us follow it step by step. Take all the important Bills that have failed to become law through the action of your Lordships' House in the last fifteen years. A few of them were enumerated by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack in the debate on the Budget last year, and they were very few. I will take one further back in date than those that the noble and learned Lord referred to on that occasion. I take the Home Rule Bill. Did or did not your Lordships then interpret the considered wish of the country in relation to that Bill, or did the Government of the day interpret it better? Is it not a fact that but for the action of your Lordships' House Home Rule would have been the law of this country fifteen years ago? Then we pass on to the Education Bill of 1906 and the Licensing Bill of 1908. We are told that we were there acting contrary to the wish of the people of the country. Since the Education Bill of 1906 and the Licensing Bill of 1908 there has been a General Election. For the first time since those Bills were introduced the people of this country have had an opportunity of expressing their wish on either of them. Is there anyone on the Front Bench opposite who will tell me that the House of Commons of to-day would pass either the Education Bill of 1906 or the Licensing Bill of 1908? We know that they would not, and, therefore, those two Bills, which were the great ground of offence against your Lordships' House in those years, are Bills with regard to which the people of this country have taken exactly the same view as your Lordships did, and have confirmed and justified your Lordships in the action that you took in respect to those Bills.<lb/>
I now come to the last Bill&#x2014;the Budget Bill of last year. We are still told by many, both by friends and foes, that we did the wrong thing when we referred that Bill to the judgment of the people. But, my Lords the plainest man can read, surely, what has happened. I think the
<col>212</col>
last majority the Government had in favour of the Budget of last year was something like 300. How much of the Budget have His Majesty's Government dared to put before the House of Commons up to the present time? Is there one shred of that Bill that they dare bring before the House of Commons now without the certainty that it would be rejected absolutely, whatever part of it they might think of touching? When we hear of the friction between the two Houses, it really is not the friction between the Houses that is in question. The friction that has arisen is because your Lordships' House has interpreted the public mind against the Government of the day, and, therefore, it is not against the people that we have made our protest; it is not against the people that we have taken any action; but against the tyranny of a passing Government.<lb/>
The Motion of the noble Earl that we are discussing to-night is as to whether we should go into Committee on the question of the reform of your Lordships' House. It appears to me that that Motion is a mere natural corollary to the Report of the Committee over which the noble Earl presided. I think we should certainly go into Committee upon that question. With respect to the Resolutions that the noble Earl has put upon the Paper, the first two are, I think, those with which the large majority of your Lordships' House would certainly concur. With regard to the third, that which lays down that a hereditary Peerage should not of itself give a right to sit and vote here, I am one of those who voted for that Resolution in the Committee and I am certainly in favour of it now. If you are going to do anything at all in the shape of House of Lords reform, whether it be great or whether it be small, you must in the first instance touch, in the way that the noble Earl suggests, the hereditary principle of your Lordships' House. Therefore, I trust that your Lordships will agree at all events to that. When we come to the wider questions that have been foreshadowed by the noble Earl as to outside elections I believe, as I have already said, that there is great difficulty in dealing with that question. I think it may be necessary and desirable to deal with it, but it requires to be dealt with with very great caution, for the reasons I have endeavoured to explain to your Lordships to-night. Upon
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0132"/>
<col>213</col>
that I shall hold my hand, and I hope all noble Lords will hold their hands also, until I see exactly what the proposals are, when I hope they will be dealt with generously, but wisely and with caution. The noble Viscount this evening took me to task because I had said&#x2014;I do not know when or where, but I do not deny that I said it somewhere&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00638"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I can give the noble Earl the reference if he desires it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00639"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: No, I do not deny it for a moment, because these are exactly my ideas. The noble Viscount said that I was in favour of reform, but I was not in favour of destruction. Then he put it that if I was in favour of the reforms foreshadowed I must be in favour of destruction, or, at all events, must see myself just on the brink. I do not see anything of the kind. I am in favour of reform, but I think that reform is exactly what may save you from destruction. I think that what you are going to get by reform is increased strength. I think you want more strength, although I do not for a moment admit the insufficiency or the inadequacy of the present House of Lords to carry on its work. But there is undoubtedly pressure from outside that some reform should be carried out, and I will tell noble Lords what I am in favour of, and what I am opposed to. I am in favour of reform, certainly not of destruction. I am in favour of increased strength to a limited extent, though I deprecate very much that the Second Chamber should be made too strong. What I do oppose, and I hope your Lordships will oppose it too with all your strength, is a sham Second Chamber of any kind. My Lords, that is the policy of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;to pretend to the country that they have a Second Chamber, and to take away from that Second Chamber every vestige of its strength. If we come to a conflict in the country on that ground I think we shall contest it with every prospect of success, because if it is made clear that what is proposed is a sham and not a reality, I believe that the people of this country will refuse it almost with unanimity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00640"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble
<col>214</col>
Earl's first sentence in the particularly thoughtful speech with which he held the attention of your Lordships' House was that it was impossible to exaggerate the importance of this discussion. I think with that every single person will agree. He then proceeded at once to fall foul of my noble friend on the Cross Benches with regard to some statements he made in his brilliant speech this afternoon, and that clearly shows how deep the cleavage must be amongst the would-be reformers of your Lordships' House. Then the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, went on to blame us because we would not join hands with him. I must respectfully ask him what are we to join hands with him about&#x2014;to do what? Why should we join hands with him? To remove the deadlock? My noble friend Lord Morley, with unerring instinct, put his finger at once on the weak point in Lord Rosebery's great speech when he pointed out that there was not one single word in it, as far as I understood him, that in any way went to remove the deadlock between the two Houses&#x2014;a deadlock which I believe both sides really deplore. Then the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, blamed us because we do not help him to remove the flaws in your Lordships' House&#x2014;flaws which he was quite ready to admit. But I most respectfully ask the noble Earl if he will be graciously pleased to allow the Government of which I am a humble member to remove those flaws in their own way. All through the debate it has been shown that there are three distinct lines of thought on this great question. There is the programme of the Labour Party They go for complete abolition, and this pestilential attitude, if I may quote the words of my noble friend on the Cross Benches&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00641"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: Pestilential attitude?</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0005P0I0133"/>
<col>215</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00644"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble Earl would be the last person who would in any way accuse me of trying to misrepresent him. The attitude of the Labour Party, as I understand it, has one great virtue, that is its extreme simplicity, although it may not be very likely to recommend itself to your Lordships to-day. But the proposal of the Labour Party in the light of the past history of the attitude of your Lordships' House to the Labour Party is not altogether surprising. The second proposal is that of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;the limitation of the Veto, as to which I need say nothing at the present moment. I believe that proposal was originally invented by Mr. John Bright. Of course your Lordships will not take the smallest notice of it, but I may remind the House that that proposal has been already carried in the Commons House of Parliament in a full House years ago.<lb/>
Now we come to the proposal of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. The two first proposals that I have mentioned are intelligible enough, but I am bound to admit that the proposals of my noble friend on the Cross Benches are not quite so easy to understand, though we are told that they follow practically the recommendations of the Select Committee of your Lordships' House which reported last year. That Report, as the House knows, stated that it was undesirable that the possession of a Peerage should of itself&#x2014;and those, my Lords, are important words&#x2014;give the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords. There were twenty-five members of that Select Committee, I believe, and seventeen out of those twenty-five voted on that recommendation and were unanimous with the single exception of Lord Halsbury. The fifteenth clause suggested that the representation of the hereditary Peerage was to be largely reduced, and under the twenty-fourth clause Peers with certain qualifications were to be entitled to sit as Lords of Parliament. My noble friend Lord Rosebery, in his great speech on the Budget last year, rather anticipated matters when he made what he called a practical suggestion of reform. It will be in your Lordships' memory what the noble Earl said. He said he meant no disrespect to the House&#x2014;of course, nobody for one moment would accuse him of any disrespect to the House of which he is so conspicuous an ornament&#x2014;in saying that
<col>216</col>
the names of some of us would not greatly count in a Division, but if you selected 150 Peers from the majority&#x2014;and he paid a great compliment to noble Lords who sit on this side of the House, because he left his old friends entirely alone and spoke of the Conservative Party only&#x2014;they would have infinitely more weight than the 400 or 500 names taken without any selection at all. That proposal was not received with any great enthusiasm. All the members of your Lordships' House, with the exception of 145, I think, voted. But that was the proposal of the noble Earl last year which is embodied in the recommendations contained in the Report of the Select Committee.<lb/>
I think even the opponents of the noble Earl's new scheme of reform must acknowledge that the Report of his Committee did contain two very noble ideals. In the first place, there is the suggestion of self-sacrifice on the part of your Lordships, and our old friend the survival of the fittest is also brought in&#x2014;a principle which would, no doubt, give a spur and an incentive to every Peer to try to do the best he could to be worthy of and to win and to keep a seat in your Lordships' House. My noble friend Lord Ribblesdale, who has left the House, quoted Latin. I now propose to quote Greek, because I think the suggestion of my noble friend on the Cross Benches harmonises with that glorious sentence that we knew so well in our younger days. I believe it was in Homer, and as far as I remember it is what Juno said to Achilles when he was starting life&#x2014;
<img src="Images\S5LV0005P0I0133.jpg"/>
&#x2014;namely, always to excel and be superior to others. Noble Lords treat that with a certain amount of merriment, and really, honestly, I am not surprised at it, because noble Lords opposite and the rank and file of your Lordships' House would say: "If you are born the son of a Peer, after all that is good fortune and that is good luck." There is not much difficulty, perhaps, about that. But if when you are born the son of a Peer you are supposed from that fact at once to be turned into a superior person or a super-man, that, I think, noble Lords opposite would agree, is a very different pair of shoes. Noble Lords are, I think, generally speaking, rather too modest a class of men. The
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0134"/>
<col>217</col>
rank and file at least do not generally claim to be representatives of religion, science, art, learning, administrative experience, or to represent the greatest naval or military talent, but I think we can fairly claim that the great bulk of the members of your Lordships' House are all really well-educated men. They are all men with a great sense of honour and probity, and they all do their best to lead useful lives, and to do their duty in that state of life in which it has pleased God to place them.<lb/>
May I give two instances to your Lordships as to how the difficulty in the way of the Rosebery proposals would work? I happen to have the great privilege of being connected, more or less remotely, with perhaps a score or so of families the heads of which are members of your Lordships' House, and amongst those there are men of great distinction. Two or three of them are Lords-Lieutenant. Most of them are magistrates&#x2014;in fact, as they are all Conservatives I think all of them are magistrates. Two of them are representatives of the oldest Baronies of England, going back to the Henrys and Williams; many of them have fought with great distinction for their King and country; and one of my relatives is a member of the Church of England, and I am bound to say he is a very great success in his way. I went once some years ago to hear him preach in his church, but the place was so crowded that I could not get beyond the porch. Then, again, in the historic county of Bucks, in which I live, I am surrounded by Peers, and by many others who are dying to be made Peers. We have Peers of all sorts. We have artistic, journalistic, pugilistic, ritualistic, and socialistic Peers. By that I do not mean revolutionary Socialists, but men of the highest social standing, and all these members of your Lordships' House have the great characteristics which have made the English nation the undoubted success that it is in the world at present. Yet out of this great collection of worthy men I can only think of one, who is a distinguished Field-Marshal, who would be passed as sound into that august body which a great leader of your Lordships' House, whom I will not name, but who took a great interest in the reform of the House of Lords in 1888, somewhat cruelly called "a mere zoological collection of abstract celebrities."<lb/>
<col>218</col>
My Lords, what under these proposals are you going to do? You are going to ask these men to put themselves voluntarily in the position of defeated candidates for the House of Commons; you are asking them voluntarily to bang, bolt, and bar the door of their hereditary House, not only against themselves but against their children and their children's children for all time. Now I can understand&#x2014;I think anybody could understand&#x2014;the House of Lords in its generosity making such a sacrifice, if all shared in the sacrifice alike. If you say that the hereditary principle is frankly to be abandoned, and that you are going to substitute an elective House instead, well and good. If you make that proposal you will have a great many people who will agree with you, and if you go north of the Trent I suppose seven or eight out of every ten men would be found heartily in favour of your proposal. But to say that the hereditary principle is to be partially maintained for the benefit of some Peers who&#x2014;I am speaking with all respect&#x2014;are not in every case necessarily wiser or better, or more informed or more loyal, or more patriotic, or more useful members of the community than the rest, seems to me&#x2014;I may be wrong&#x2014;a wholly unreasonable proposal and one which could not be fairly maintained for one single moment. It is no business of mine, but I do honestly think that if those who support the noble Earl on the Cross Benches try conclusions with Lord Halsbury, that veteran champion of the hereditary privileges of your Lordships' House, who is one of the most conspicuous ornaments of this House, and who, I may, perhaps, remind your Lordships, obtained his Peerage because of his intellectual eminence and not because of his being the son of his father, they will probably find themselves in a minority.<lb/>
As I have already said, the noble Viscount behind me, with unerring instinct, put his finger on the one weak spot of the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, when he pointed out that that speech contained no suggestion of relieving the deadlock which we regret to say exists between the two Houses, and which it seems to me is getting very serious indeed. There is no doubt that on this subject the temper of the nation is rising. Your own Press acknowledges that. All you have to do is to read Mr. Garvin's editorials in the <i>Observer</i>. He tells you, perhaps I might say with brutal frankness, that the existing state of things in the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0135"/>
<col>219</col>
Second Chamber is indefensible in theory and untenable in practice. I would, however, rather not use that somewhat vulgar bludgeon of Mr. Garvin's, I would prefer to use the still more deadly rapier thrust of my noble friend Lord Rosebery, who on March 17, 1894, said that what he complained of in the House of Lords was that during the tenure of one Government the House was a Second Chamber of an inexorable kind, while when another Government was in power it was not a Second Chamber at all. You have two Chambers under a Liberal Government, whereas under a Conservative Government you have a single Chamber. "Therefore, I say," said the noble Earl, "we are face to face with a great difficulty, a great danger, and a great peril to the State." My Lords, will the proposal of the noble Earl in any way remove or even diminish these perils, these dangers, and these difficulties? I do not believe it will. If I thought it would I should be the first to follow my noble friend into the Lobby, just the same as I did years ago. The question before the country at this present moment is whether the Liberal Party shall or shall not have a share equal to that of the Tory Party in the management of the country, and to that question I believe the whole Progressive Party in this country&#x2014;in England, in Ireland, in Scotland, and in Wales&#x2014;would say "Aye" The Liberal Party is pledged to destroy by law the Lords' Veto in financial matters only, and to limit it, with proper safeguards of course, in other matters. A noble Lord laughs, but that is not a new proposal. I think I might cite to him in support of it the words of Lord Granville, quoted by Lord Wemyss in his letter to <i>The Times</i> this morning&#x2014;
<quote>"The powers of the Lords should be properly limited and controlled."</quote>
That was said thirty or forty years ago, and this, my Lords, I should think can be done by a very short measure, the main recommendations of which will, I believe, be in the near future laid before your Lordships' House.<lb/>
In conclusion, all I have to say is that Lord Rosebery's proposals involve the very contentious subject which relates to the composition of this House, the most delicate and difficult of all constitutional tasks; but what we maintain is that the unfairness of the Party system which at present exists, under which the House of Lords has befriended so many Tory Bills and measures, and destroyed so many Liberal ones, must in some proper way no longer be allowed to
<col>220</col>
continue, but must be brought to an end, and to an end at once. That is the great question before us, and before the country. This question was precipitated, I believe, by the action that your Lordships thought fit to take&#x2014;although I am the first to admit that the action you did take last year was actuated by the highest and purest and most patriotic motives&#x2014;in refusing to grant Supplies to the Crown. The real question remains, and this is the great question that we have before us. It is a question which the whole Progressive Party are prepared to fight, and it is a question which the Liberal Government proposes to lead them in the fight upon, and to stand or to fall by the decision upon it. I have to thank the House very much for allowing me to make these remarks, and I would only add that my reason for interposing in this Debate was that I thought it would not be right if I could not give expression openly in your Lordships' House to the same arguments that I and many of those who think with me used throughout the country during the last Election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00645"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must confess that I regret that this discussion has taken place; in fact, so strongly do I feel on the subject that I have been tempted to place on the notice Paper an Amendment to the effect that "This House deems it desirable, before taking any steps in the matter of reform, to await the proposals as to its constitution and powers which are foreshadowed in the gracious Speech from the Throne." I have not moved this Amendment because I felt that any proposals made by the noble Earl, the only member of your Lordships' House who has occupied the high position of Prime Minister of this country, deserve to receive and would receive the careful consideration of moderate men in both political camps, and that it was therefore unbecoming of a member of the rank and file of your Lordships' House to move what amounted to a direct negative, unless he was assured of the support and approval of the Front Opposition Bench. But, my Lords, I think this need not prevent me from laying before your Lordships the reasons why I think that the Motion of the noble Earl is inopportune.<lb/>
I am sure there is no member of your Lordships' House, at least on the Opposition side, who will not welcome any measure which may tend to strengthen this Chamber or add to its efficiency, but there is a time and season for everything, and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0136"/>
<col>221</col>
in my humble opinion this is not the time nor the season for your Lordships to enter into the question of the reform of this House. Let me review the situation, very briefly, for the facts are known to us all. Last year your Lordships thought fit to refer to the country the Budget of the year, not only because in your opinion it was a bad Budget and because it contained revolutionary proposals, but also because a large amount of matter extraneous to the finances for the existing year was attached to it which constituted a breach of the privileges of your Lordships' House. I was astonished to hear the Leader of the House, in the course of the debate the other day, say that he imagined the contention that there was tacking in that Bill had been dropped because the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition suggested that if the Budget ever came before this House again it would be passed into law. My Lords, as I understand the position of this House we are always ready to pass what the country desires, whether it should be a Bill which affects our privileges or not; but we do not acknowledge that the ephemeral majority in another place always represents the fixed determination of the country. At any rate, in this case we were amply justified by results, and your Lordships have been proved right because in the new House of Commons there is a considerable majority opposed to the Budget. As in 1893 you were acclaimed as the saviours of your country from disruption, so at the present time we may be congratulated as having saved the country from a system of taxation which must have wrought serious and lasting injury. Even the Government acknowledge that your Lordships have got the best of it, and state that they dare not enter into another contest with this House until they have succeeded, whether by constitutional or extra-constitutional means, in tying our hands behind our backs.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Leader of the House told us the other night that a state of warfare existed between the two Houses, and that on their side hostilities had already begun. He explained how the Radical Party in the House of Commons as a means of defence had blown up their bridges and pulled up their lines of railway. In other words, they had put the country to large unnecessary expense by resorting to borrowing instead of collecting taxes which the taxpayers are only too ready to
<col>222</col>
pay and as to which there is no dispute, in order to secure a tactical advantage over this House. I should not complain if this kriegsspiel could be carried to its legitimate conclusion, and if in the event of your Lordships proving victorious a war indemnity could be demanded. I fear we shall be unable to recover from His Majesty's present advisers the vast expense to which they have put the country because they prefer to govern in the interests of a faction rather than for the welfare of the nation as a whole. Well, we have heard of the state of warfare that exists between the two Houses. The first steps in the hostilities have been taken, and ere long we may expect the first pitched battle to take place. Is this the time to take off our armour to see whether there are any rents in it or whether it requires repair? Is this the moment to parade our sick and inefficient soldiers? Take care lest while we are doing so the enemy fall upon us and we are completely routed. Is it not better to stick to the armour which we have and which has served us well in former battles, to try and persuade our sick and inefficient soldiers to be more valorous in the future, and, standing shoulder to shoulder strong in the consciousness of past victories, strong in the knowledge that we are fighting not for ourselves but for what we believe to be the interests of our country, defeat the enemy; and then when the fight is won, but not before, to set to work in the piping times of peace, and, if it is considered necessary, take whatever steps are desirable to reform this House, and, in the jargon of the day make it suitable to modern requirements. I know that this course does not recommend itself to the noble Earl on the Cross Benches.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Carrington, reminded us of the advice which Lord Rosebery gave to the House last year. Lord Rosebery came down in the midst of the battle on the Budget and advised the majority of your Lordships to pass a self-denying ordinance, to declare that in your opinion you were incompetent to take part in so vital an issue and to discharge the duties entrusted to you by the Constitution, and he counselled you to retire to the steps of the Throne, to be spectators of, but not participators in, the fateful Division on the Finance Bill. If that course appeared advisable to him then, I cannot be surprised that he should recommend another confession of your unworthiness
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0137"/>
<col>223</col>
now. I yield to nobody in my admiration of the noble Earl, and nobody listens with greater delight than I do to his speeches, but I hope he will forgive me if I say that sometimes at the termination of them I am reminded of the old song&#x2014;
<quote>"The King of France went up the hill with twenty thousand men,</quote>
<quote>The King of France came down the hill, but ne'er went up again,"</quote>
The noble Earl will, I hope, pardon me if I suggest that this is a course of action which has recommended itself to him on more than one occasion. May I ask noble Lords opposite if they remember being led up the Home Rule hill in 1893, although I am glad to say that the noble Earl has reached the level again, and does not propose to make any mountaineering feats in that direction.<lb/>
Last year one of the most strenuous leaders of the anti-Budget fight was the noble Earl. The echoes of his speech at Glasgow reverberated to the utmost confines of the Kingdom. No more powerful or effective indictment of the policy of His Majesty's Government was made. I feel sure that many of your Lordships who up to then had not decided what your duty might be with regard to the action you would take in the matter, were decided by that speech that it was your duty, at all hazards, to deliver your country, if possible, from the peril with which it was threatened. Yet when the day of battle arrived the noble Earl was the first to come down to this House and deliver a most eloquent sermon to us for which he might have chosen for his text&#x2014;
<quote>"He who fights and runs away</quote>
<quote>Shall live to fight another day."</quote>
And now, again, the noble Earl counsels us to take strong measures with regard to the reform of this House. Will the noble Earl forgive me if, with the recollection of his attitude on the Budget, I say I fear lest when the emasculating Resolutions of His Majesty's Government are produced, amended, perhaps, as has been suggested by Lord Ribblesdale, the noble Earl may tell us that the surest way of safety lies in accepting them.<lb/>
My Lords, I, for one, cannot see what we can gain by entering into this question of reform at the present minute. We shall certainly gain no <i>kudos</i> in the matter, because we shall be told we refrained from doing so until the pistol was held to our heads. I do not see either that we shall
<col>224</col>
gain anything in the way of tactics. The Government have a very difficult game to play, and I would prefer to see their hand on the table before disclosing my own cards. Their policy, as I understand it, is divided into two parts: first, the Veto of the House of Lords; and, secondly, what may be relegated to the Greek Kalends, the question of reform. The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, has dealt so well with the first part of their programme that it is unnecessary for me to attempt to go over it again. The question of Veto has only to be submitted to the people of this country, and as soon as they realise that it means government by a single Chamber it is certain to be rejected. But if the Government attempt to deal with the second part, that of reform, their difficulties will be very great. If they try to create a strong Second Chamber, they will find themselves opposed by the vast majority of their supporters, and if, instead, they attempt to create what is only a sham Chamber they will, as the noble Earl told us, find it impossible to procure any self-respecting men who are willing to become members of it. In addition to this, they will have to deal with the question of hereditary rights, and it seems to me that that is a most difficult subject for any English Statesmen to deal with, for we must not forget that we, both Liberals and Conservatives, acknowledge one hereditary element which we all love and respect and which we regard as one of the most valued and valuable assets of the country. My Lords, it appears to me that it is not for the Opposition to present a constructive scheme. If we do so, our proposals will be attacked and our differences exposed and shown up, as has been done this afternoon by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India. It is for the Government to enunciate their policy, and when we have had it before us and examined it, and when we have criticised its weak points&#x2014;which there will be no difficulty in doing&#x2014;it will then be time enough for our leaders to put forward an alternative scheme of reasonable and reasoned reform to lay before the electors of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00646"><member>LORD KILLANIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this late hour of the evening I shall not detain your Lordships at any length, but as there is the opportunity I should like to avail myself of it to make one or two observations in reference to the important matter before the House. One of the observations I
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0138"/>
<col>225</col>
should like to make is with reference to the question of qualification. The question has come very prominently before the country owing to the Return asked for by Lord Onslow, and it was generally understood that in the projected reconstitution of your Lordships' House by the noble Earl he would take that question into account. Without going into it in detail, I want to say on that that if the House is going to consider the question of qualifications it ought to remember that the present members of this House deserve very special treatment in the matter, because they are existing members of the House, with more or less vested rights and interests in it. Their qualifications may be great or they may be small, their public services may not be very conspicuous, the public may not be aware of what they have done, but the fact remains that a large number of the members of your Lordships' House have given a great deal of time and attention to their public duties and responsibilities, and have gone through a great deal of labour in qualifying themselves for fulfilling those duties and responsibilities as members of your Lordships' House, regulating their lives and their affairs in the past to that end.<lb/>
I might even go further and say that owing to the very position which we have held in this House as Lords of Parliament we have been actually circumscribed and hampered in our ordinary interests and possible actions in life. If, therefore, qualifications are going to become important I do think that the <i>personnel</i> of this House as it exists to-day would be deserving of special consideration, and that vested rights and privileges, which are, after all, only the counterpart of vested duties and responsibilities, should be respected in any consideration of this matter. Therefore I hope, if the question of qualifications is gone into, a distinction will be drawn between the qualifications deemed necessary in the case of new members coming into this House, and the qualifications deemed sufficient in the case of members already existing in your Lordships' House. When the constitution of the French Senate, some twenty years or so ago, was changed from life members into members elected for each Parliament, the rights and privileges of the life members of the House were recognised, and they were left there. I think, my Lords, that if that were understood at all, it would mean that the full
<col>226</col>
rights and privileges of the existing members of the House would not be ignored, and it would avoid going into what, I think, would be very invidious and petty distinctions between one Lord and another.<lb/>
I am sorry I have not heard more this afternoon in reference to the reconstructing of this House by the creation of life Peerages. As far as I have heard, there has been very little said on that subject. I, personally, attach very great importance to the strengthening of this House by means of life Peerages. I consider it an excellent plan to add to the House a number of men of high distinction in science, art, literature and medicine, and in the public services. If we do go into that question I should wish to stipulate that the life Peers should be chosen in such a way that they would be representative of all parts of the Kingdom. The noble Earl this afternoon referred to the possibility of an elected element in this House, and I understood him to say that he thought, just adumbrating it, that several of these members might be nominated or elected by county councils. Whatever we do, I hope we will not do that. I am, and have been for many years, a member of a county council, and my belief has always been that a county council was not a political body, that in being a county councillor I was standing upon non-political ground, that I would have no legislative powers on that council, and that I was merely as a resident and a ratepayer appealing to my friends to place me upon it to represent them in that way with regard to rates and local affairs. I therefore look on any proposal that would bring county councils within the political arena as one which would work very badly, both for the county councils themselves and for this House.<lb/>
I, personally, would have no objection to seeing a portion of this House elected, and as I am addressing your Lordships I might say how I consider that element should be introduced into this House. I think there should be, somehow or other, some reflection of the House of Commons within these walls. But although I am in favour of an elected element coming in, I am far from wishing your Lordships' House to become a replica of the House of Commons. I think the advantage of having two Chambers is not merely that all legislation must pass the two Houses. The great advantage of two Chambers is that they are of different
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0139"/>
<col>227</col>
origins, and different compositions, and different characters, and that they judge questions from different points of view. But while I feel that, nevertheless I do feel that there ought to be some reflection of the varying public opinion of the country in this House, and therefore I agree with what Mr. Balfour said the other day when he stated that there should be some direct and formal connection between public opinion and the Second Chamber. What I would like to see as a mode of reflecting that public opinion into this House would be that every House of Commons should have the power of electing sixty-seven members to this House; thus, every ten members of the House of Commons would have the power of electing one member, and therefore any candidate proposed would, after getting ten votes from the House of Commons, be thereupon declared a member of this House. That would mean an addition, if we take this particular Parliament, of sixty-seven elected members to your Lordships' House, representing all Parties in the House of Commons&#x2014;Labour by four; Nationalists, eight; Irish Unionists, two; and the Liberal and Conservative Parties the rest between them. By that means you would bring into this House in the case of each Parliament some reflection of that Parliament. That is the way I would myself suggest that an elected element should be introduced into this House. I know it has often been said that that is an indirect way of introducing it, and that it is a disadvantage if you do it through the county councils&#x2014;in other words, if you do it through a body elected for another purpose. That would be a great disadvantage. But in the House of Commons the members are elected for the purpose of representing
<col>228</col>
the political views of the time, and therefore their elected members in this House would be carrying out the direct work for which they themselves were originally elected.<lb/>
My Lords, I have only one other observation to make, and that is with reference to the suggestion that one mode of re-constituting this House should be by selection amongst the Peers themselves from among their own number. I hope that course will not be adopted. If we had a very small body to choose from it would mean, I think, that the choosers would be a very small body also, and I do not believe it would work well. One of the great arguments in favour of the hereditary principle is that we are independent. We are dependent on no one's votes and no one's good will for being here. I therefore look upon any form of election of Peers by their fellow Peers as possessing all the disadvantages of the hereditary principle and of election, and I think it would simply introduce into this House more Party feeling, which is the thing we wish to keep out. This mode of election has not, I believe, worked very well in either Scotland or Ireland, not on account of the way it was exercised by the possessors of it but because of the inherent viciousness of the system.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00683"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think none of your Lordships will dispute what was said by the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, last night in the opening of his weighty speech as to the far-reaching importance of the discusion in which we are taking part. The Motion before us, and the Government proposals which are, throughout this discussion, in the background, raise issues, I suppose, as grave as any which Parliament has for many years had to face. It will not be thought unnatural that, sitting where I am called to sit, I should wish to say something on so great a theme.<lb/>
We heard last night about the antiquity of the hereditary tenure in this House. The office which I hold had already been in active occupancy for some six centuries or more when the ancestors of noble Lords who sit here by the oldest tenure took their place some 700 years ago in the Legislature of the country. If you want to find out when the Archbishop first took his place in what may be called Parliamentary affairs you must investigate the germs and origins of Parliamentary or conciliar life in the days of the Saxons. In the earliest, in the most embryonic Witenagemote he had his place, and when, as we were reminded last night, the scene took place at Runnymede, wherein the Archbishop led the Barons to exort their Charter from King John, the Archbishop was already the forty-second of his line. Therefore I offer no apology for asking to be allowed to say a few words on this subject now.<lb/>
I do not know whether your Lordships have noticed on what day it is that we meet. To-day, my Lords, we have reached the Ides of March. You will interpret the omen variously, according to your bent. The position as I seem to see it is this. The Government of the day is about to invite us to take a step for crippling, and for crippling by Statute&#x2014;and I emphasise that point&#x2014;the power of one of the Houses of Parliament. It is hardly necessary to point out that, with the single exception of the brief and troubled Commonwealth years, such an act, such a step, is absolutely without precedent or parallel in the constitutional history of this country. An occasion may
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0142"/>
<col>233</col>
arise in a nation's story when something has taken place grave enough to justify a complete breach with the past: a sweeping departure from immemorial usage, but to justify it I suppose that the situation must be not merely grave to the point of peril, but that the peril must be actually within sight, and all other means of bringing about a remedy must be barred.<lb/>
For some six or seven centuries of our history Englishmen have been able to effect in their constitutional system changes and reforms and adaptations of a far-reaching kind without, so far as the Legislature is concerned, any violent breach with the historical past. Changes have been as frequent as were naturally to be expected in the long development of a living, growing organism. Nothing in our public life or our great institutions corresponds to-day to what it was 500 or even 300 years ago. The Crown itself; the <i>status</i> and modes of action of the House of Commons; the position of the national Church; the growth and character of our municipalities; the condition of our judicature; the mode of trial by jury; the question of the freedom of the Press&#x2014;to name but a few&#x2014;every one of these has changed and changed again by means of quiet common-sense developments, and processes rather than by cataclysms or violence.<lb/>
With regard to the Legislature we may go further. In no instance, speaking roughly (or rather speaking almost with precise accuracy), has either House of the Legislature been interfered with by Statute during the whole history of England as regards the mode of doing its work or as regards its relation to the other House. There are trifling exceptions as regards the internal workings of either House. There was some years ago a change, which I believe was obtained with characteristic perseverance by the Scottish members, for abbreviating the procedure in reference to Scottish private Bills in the House of Commons. That is the only example unless we go back to the reign of Henry VIII, when there was a Statute to regulate the order in which my right rev. brothers the Bishops of London and Durham and Winchester should sit on this Bench and the relative precedence that should be observed. I hope that they are observing that statute carefully this evening! But the rule is unvarying that changes with regard to Parliamentary action and life have in either House been made by the action of that
<col>234</col>
House and not by statutory enactments. It has been <i>Mos pro lege</i>. It is an example of the difference to which our attention was drawn in weighty and far-reaching terms by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack when he called our attention a few weeks ago to the difference between constitutional and legal action.<lb/>
It is said that some change is now necessary in the Constitution or procedure of the House of Lords, and that we must amend things considerably. Well, so be it. But how? Is it to be done by the processes hitherto universally adopted or by a new process for the first time in our history introduced for a purpose of this kind? The House of Lords has already amended and modified its arrangements a great many times in recent centuries. I do not need to go back 400 years, to the times that were referred to in the great and memorable speech of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, to which we listened last night, the days when the hereditary principle was not dominant as regards the majority in this House, for the majority was frequently, if not invariably, ecclesiastical, and, whatever the shortcomings or inadequacies of ecclesiastics, the ecclesiastical position was not an hereditary one.<lb/>
In more recent times the contrasts between the House of Lords to-day and the House of Lords of a century and a-half ago are manifest. There were, I think, 149 effective Peers&#x2014;I am leaving out minors and Peeresses&#x2014;in the year when George III came to the Throne. Throughout the eighteenth century the balance of power between the two Parties in this House was, of course, fairly equal, contrasting very markedly with what it has been in our own day. Again, down to the year 1868 the whole position and action of this House was affected by the use of proxies, which were only then abolished. All these changes, my Lords, came about, I think, incidentally. No one of them can be described as a deliberate attempt to do something for the bettering of the position or the workableness of the House. They were rather incidental to something else that was taking place, independently of the question how we were to conduct our business.<lb/>
I think the position is a different one now, and I for one believe and desire to say as strongly as I can that we ought to go to work deliberately, with definite
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0143"/>
<col>235</col>
intent, and with unflinching courage, for amending that which needs amendment with regard both to the composition of the House and to the manner of our procedure. But it is we ourselves who ought to do it instead of letting it be forced upon us from outside. But to say that we are to do it courageously does not mean that we are to do it violently. The unwritten Constitution which we possess is a heritage which is venerable in a sense that very few things even in this old country are venerable. It is venerable not least by means of the respect, the reverence and the self-restraint with which it has been handled by successive generations of reformers during the last 250 or 300 years. The Shakespearian words apply&#x2014;
<quote>"We do it wrong, being so majestical</quote>
<quote>To offer it the show of violence."</quote>
The value of an unwritten, as contrasted with a written Constitution, is a matter on which it is quite unnecessary to trouble your Lordships.<lb/>
Any writer you choose to refer to who has dwelt upon the story of the growth of English constitutional life tells us the same thing of the gain that has ensued from our having an unwritten Constitution, and how that value consists in no small degree in the claim and demand such a Constitution makes upon public men for restraint and tact and carefulness, in the true sense for statesmanship in dealing with or handling that living thing. It contrasts at every turn with a written Constitution embodied in specific enactments. Its elasticity gives a wider sweep, and enlists and evokes in the conduct of affairs a far greater variety of powers. If any of your Lordships is unfamiliar with that subject, I would ask him to refer to the chapters written by one who sat not long ago on the Government benches in another place, and who is certainly not to be regarded as a bigoted Tory, the present illustrious Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Bryce. If you read the chapters in which he develops, with extraordinary vividness and skill, the growth of the American Constitution in its first days, and the way in which it has been worked since, you find, not necessarily expressed, often unexpressed, but always there, the sense he has of the value of the unwritten Constitution of our own country, upon which so much was based when that wonderful American Constitution was drafted and put into shape by Alexander Hamilton and his colleagues. The marks of our unwritten Constitution were stamped
<col>236</col>
indelibly upon the pages of the written one across the Atlantic. The contrast between the two systems is great. It is the contrast between a living, pulsing organism and a formulated table of artificial enactments, however excellent these may be.<lb/>
As I understand, what is now proposed is to introduce into that living, breathing thing that we have had in this country for so many centuries a perfectly new feature. The Government propose to thrust into it by formal statutary enactments something hard and unmalleable, something that will be a foreign element in an organism such as ours, laying down in specific terms precise questions of detail as regards the internal mechanism of our machine in a manner that must run counter to the whole manner and principle on which that machine has been handled during the centuries that are past. I believe this to be all wrong. But our difficulties at the present juncture are not small. For, my Lords, to keep that living thing, if I may go back to the parallel, fresh and strong, you must beware lest you strain any of its nicely-balanced parts. One of these overstrained, and persistently overstrained, may throw the whole very easily out of gear. It is because we have been able for centuries to avoid that kind of overstrain, or, if it occurred, so to relieve matters that the strain was not persistent, that we are able to look with thankfulness and pride to the continuous life and adaptableness of the Constitution, of which we are the inheritors.<lb/>
But we are now told that that is exactly what has happened, that we are standing now in a position where there has been that overstrain, and that the whole life has suffered or must necessarily suffer. So we are told. We are told that the House of Lords has so acted that it has strained the organism to breaking point, that it has over-balanced the Constitution. I fully admit that the events of last year do bid us consider afresh how we stand. I think most of your Lordships would agree about that. They will agree that there has been overstrain, but they will differ as to which set of men were responsible. Those who sit upon the Benches beside me [the Government Benches] will say:&#x2014;"My Lords, you have yourselves to thank for the position in which we stand. It was you who violated the unwritten rule, who upset the balance of our Constitution. By your act in rejecting the Finance Bill of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0144"/>
<col>237</col>
the year and in forcing a dissolution of Parliament, whether you call that one act or two, you called attention inevitably to the hopelessly anomalous and out-of-date composition of this House. We must amend that forthwith. Such a thing can never be allowed to happen again. It is an outrage in a country professing to be governed in accordance with the people's will." I think I have not unfairly put the way in which that matter has been presented both in this House and outside by those who take that view. But then they are met by those who throw the blame exactly upon the opposite or opposing shoulders. "Not a bit," they reply. "You produced a Budget which the country had not asked for. You desired mischievous, irritating and unfair things to be done. You devised a plan which was outrageous in its inception. It was still more outrageous in the way you thrust it upon this House with the imperious demand, 'Pass it forthwith or reject it, if you dare,' and the House refused to take that course until the country should declare its mind." That is the other side. So the controversy goes on and the recriminations are bandied to and fro on either side.<lb/>
I do not know how many of your Lordships will agree with me, but my own firm conviction is that, if a thoughtful and really competent observer from another land were now summing up the situation in the light of what has happened in the last twelve months, or if we could imagine one of the statesman-soldiers of the seventeenth century, one of the men who had borne a part in the really great and tremendous emergencies in the English life of that period, rising from his sleep to watch us in the last six months, such observer would be lost in amazement at our supposing that anything has really and truly occurred big enough to justify the suggested sweeping departure from the whole usage of English life for centuries as regards the manner of constitutional reform. He would say:&#x2014;"There has been the grossest exaggeration on either side. It may be quite true, it is true perhaps, that the House of Commons' proposals did not correspond with those of former years. They were legitimately open to criticism, to censure, if you will, but there was nothing in them so appalling, so disastrous, so necessarily mischievous and terrible in character as to justify the epithets with which the Houses of Parliament and the country outside are familiar respecting that measure." And, on the other side, granted that the
<col>238</col>
House of Lords did depart from precedent, that it did, by rejecting that Bill, and by forcing an appeal to the people themselves throw big questions on the carpet, to say that what it did "reduced the House of Commons for the future to a mere dummy" or "trampled contemptuously on the people's rights"&#x2014;I quote the words actually used by responsible men&#x2014;that is a misuse of language which verges on the grotesque.<lb/>
Nothing has, in my belief, so far gone wrong in our public life as to be incapable of reasonable adjustment if it be approached in the right way. We are invited so to approach it by the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery. We are invited to look afresh at the composition&#x2014;and be it always remembered that the composition affects the action and conduct&#x2014;of a House of the Legislature, and to consider whether it needs amendment now and, if it does, what that amendment ought to be. The composition of this House has not only been open to challenge and criticism for a great many years, but, as we have constantly been reminded, it has been challenged and criticised within these walls. The memorable speech to which we listened last night was a natural sequel of speeches equally remarkable delivered in 1884, in 1888, and on other occasions, and we have to remember&#x2014;every one who has studied the subject does&#x2014;the weighty words that were spoken from the Government Bench by the late Lord Salisbury not many years ago. What we have now to do, as it seems to me, is to get these proposals into shape. It is possible to do it, it is worth while to do it, and, in my belief, the result will be to produce the adjustment that we need. At all events, surely, we ought to find by experience that it has failed to do so before we manufacture, under the plea of readjustment and reform, a brand new constitutional system unlike any that exists in any great nation in the world.<lb/>
For it is, surely, nothing less than the manufacture of a new and untried single-Chamber place that the Government invites us to undertake. That is the alternative set before us. I listened last night with great care to the speech of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, and if I understood him aright he told us that it was wholly wrong to speak of the Government's proposal as a single-Chamber plan, and further, he reminded us that at present we did not know what the plan really is. Well, had it been any one else than the noble Viscount, who is
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0145"/>
<col>239</col>
incapable of anything but the most straightforward and lucid utterance, I should have said that that was really trifling with us. We may not know&#x2014;I do not know&#x2014;what the Government's plan is to-night on the Ides of March; I do know what it was a fortnight ago. The Prime Minister then used these words:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Resolutions will affirm&#x2014;I am speaking now in general terms&#x2014;the necessity for excluding the House of Lords altogether from the domain of finance. They will ask this House to declare that in the sphere of legislation the power of veto at present possessed by the House of Lords shall be so limited in its exercise as to secure the predominance of the deliberate and considered will of this House within the lifetime of a single Parliament. Further, it will be made plain that these constitutional changes are without prejudice to, and contemplate in a subsequent year, the substitution in our Second Chamber of the democratic method of representation. If this House should assent to the Resolutions, a Bill to give effect to them will without delay be introduced."</quote>
If these words do not mean that a Bill on any subject may become an Act by the action of one House of the Legislature against the will of the other within the lifetime of one Parliament, I do not know what English words mean. And if it does mean that, then it is simply and explicitly a single-Chamber system, disguise it as you may.<lb/>
I am absolutely in favour of a large and liberal readjustment of the composition, and possibly in some ways the work, of this House. It is a very difficult task. It will take time, and will involve controversy. It is merely childish, in my judgment, to taunt those who want reform with the fact that they cannot readily agree upon all details. Of course they cannot. There must be patience, there must be controversy, and there must be time. It is impossible for any large body of men to take up a subject so complex and arrive at an agreement at once as to exactly what they want, but there is no reason for doubting that, if the proper steps are taken, that agreement will ultimately be arrived at. I believe that result to be obtainable, but it needs patience. In effecting such readjustment we Bishops are perfectly ready to take our part, both in the work and in the outcome. It would be out of place to go into detail now, but without professing to represent the opinions of every member of the Episcopal Bench&#x2014;that I have no means of doing&#x2014;some such plan as is suggested with regard to the Bishops in the Report of what is known as the Rosebery Committee, if it be part of a great whole, and consistent with that whole, would certainly, I think, not find obstacles or difficulties proceeding
<col>240</col>
from the Episcopal Bench. More than that it is difficult to say now, but personally I should not imagine that any practical difficulties would be found to arise to the production of a wise and well-considered scheme.<lb/>
I would end as I began. In what we do we have to bear in mind the venerableness, the historic worth, the proved workableness of the House of Lords, and its place in the National life. It is vain at any time, and especially in our own, to rest and to trust only to the traditions of the distant past. I entirely agree in the desire to amend whatever is inadequate or inappropriate or amiss, but we are called upon to remember too that what we are handling is a unique possession balanced in all its parts, and were we to tear lightly its unique records or rend one of its limbs, we should make ourselves deservedly the scorn of the civilised world. Your Lordships will remember, and most of all the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, will remember, how the greatest political thinker of our land, or, perhaps, of any land, spoke on that subject in eloquent terms 140 years ago, and surely his warning has lost nothing of its weight and force to-day. I quote his words&#x2014;
<quote>"Our Constitution stands on a nice equipoise, with steep precipices and deep waters upon all sides of it. In removing it from a dangerous leaning towards one side there may be a risk of oversetting it on the other. Every project of a material change in a Government so complicated as ours, combined at the same time with external circumstances still more complicated, is a matter full of difficulties in which a considerate man will not be too ready to decide; a prudent man too ready to undertake; or an honest man too ready to promise."</quote>
My Lords, those words were never more needed than they are to-day. I give my support to the Motion of the noble Earl, believing that we shall thus be led to the best kind of remedy for admitted needs, be they great or small. That by that process we shall at once secure all that we want neither I nor any of your Lordships can imagine; but that we shall be on the right path towards securing it I most firmly believe; and I hope your Lordships will give effect to the Resolutions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00684"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships will all agree that in the speech to which we have just listened the most rev. Primate has approached this subject in a spirit which is worthy of him. He recognised, as we all recognise, the great gravity of the crisis at which we have arrived, and yet he urged your Lordships, and, indeed, I think his voice was intended to go far beyond your
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0146"/>
<col>241</col>
Lordships' House, to counsels of moderation&#x2014;moderation of statement and moderation of policy&#x2014;which we shall do well to follow. And, lastly, he reminded your Lordships that such matters of moment as we are now discussing cannot be decided without difficulty.<lb/>
We listened last night to one of the great speeches which are from time to time delivered in this House by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. I think that he, if he will allow me to pay him what little compliment I am capable of paying, has added one more reason to the many reasons for which your Lordships and the country have to be grateful to him. I know that my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale, speaking last night, expressed the opinion that the opportunity was not well chosen for these debates. I recognise that there may be legitimate difference of opinion upon that point, but, for my own part, I think that the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has judged rightly that this is not a case upon which we can remain silent; that we are bound&#x2014;the House of Lords is bound&#x2014;to have a policy of our own, and to take an early opportunity of considering that policy. Beyond that, I venture to express the hope that the treatment which the noble Earl gave to the single-Chamber policy of His Majesty's Government may have far-reaching effects.<lb/>
I do not think, if I may say so, that the noble Viscount opposite seriously attempted to deal with the arguments of the noble Earl. It is quite clear from what the noble Earl said last night, and from what the most rev. Primate has just uttered, that the policy of the Government is nothing more nor less than a single-Chamber policy, and it is also true that, if both Houses of Parliament should agree on the present occasion to destroy your Lordships' Veto and to postpone till hereafter the changes and improvements which are foreshadowed by the Government in the composition of this House, though the first may have an effect, the second will never be heard of again. The most rev. Primate spoke very properly of the exaggerated language which was used with respect to the action of your Lordships' House last winter. The expressions used in criticism of what we did were, in my belief, entirety undeserved, but undoubtedly the step we took was a strong step. Any candid controversialist would admit that. The justification for that strong step was the great change in the circumstances with which we had to deal&#x2014;the most rev. Primate
<col>242</col>
has reminded you of it in very moderate language&#x2014;the very striking nature of the Finance Bill which was submitted to this House and the very remarkable manner in which that Bill was passed through the House of Commons.<lb/>
Upon this point I should like to trouble your Lordships for a few moments regarding the great change which in our time has taken place in the House of Commons. I desire, of course, to speak of the House of Commons with all the respect which is due to that great Assembly. If I required any other motive, I might say that for seventeen years I was a member of the House of Commons, and I suppose that I took as much interest in its proceedings and was as devoted to its great traditions as any member of that honourable House; and it was with a feeling of growing disappointment that one watched all through those years what I cannot but describe as a certain slow process of decay&#x2014;decay not only in the procedure of that House, with which, of course, the public and your Lordships are all familiar, but, as I believe, in the reputation which the House enjoys amongst the people of this country. I do not wish to use any extreme language; it still remains the greatest representative Assembly in the world, but undoubtedly there was, even in my time, a marked change, which was to me, and must be to anyone who values our great institutions, a matter of profound regret.<lb/>
In the first place, the attitude with which the people of this country regard the House of Commons has changed. Your Lordships have recently had an opportunity of judging from a very close point of view the conduct of a contested election in this country. A great many of the noble Lords who sit behind me, and a few who sit in front&#x2014;though not so many there&#x2014;took part in the General Election, and did their utmost to persuade the electors to adopt the views which they entertained. The noble Earl last night reminded your Lordships of the condition of things under which a modern election is carried out. Speeches, leaflets, and placards of every kind and degree of inaccuracy&#x2014;I am afraid even a stronger word must be used to describe them&#x2014;are the constant feature of modern General Elections. I do not know whether one has any right to say that that is altogether avoidable. Mendacity, no doubt, should be avoidable, but inaccuracy is almost inevitable. I believe that if an archangel addressed an election meeting he would be bound to be inaccurate. The truth is that in explaining political
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0147"/>
<col>243</col>
policy and in defending political conduct to a public meeting a certain amount of largeness and looseness of expression is absolutely requisite. If all the qualifications which correspond to the precise truth were put into a public speech they would not be understood; and any speaker who was so sincere as to do so would probably be set down as belonging to the other side. Inaccuracy, therefore, I am afraid one must make up one's mind to; but when the operation is entrusted, not merely to accomplished speakers, but to all the supporters of a candidate and is reduced to leaflets and placards, that inaccuracy degenerates, of course, into something much more grave than that.<lb/>
Why have I ventured to trouble your Lordships with this description of public meetings, with which in other times we were not so closely familiar? It is because I believe the result has been to create in the minds of the electors much less satisfaction with their representative institutions than used to be the case. There is a certain disbelief in politicians in the present day, which is a very serious symptom. On the top of this has come the modern political organisation. I am speaking, of course, of what is commonly known as the caucus&#x2014;the Conservative Association, the Liberal Three Hundred, or whatever it is called. The noble Viscount opposite is familiar with other such organisations. My Lords, that has a double effect. It affects, in the first place, the freedom of the electors, for there are only practically two doors to the suffrages of the electors. Either you must go through the door of the Conservative Association, or you must go through the door of the Liberal Three Hundred, so that the choice of the electors is very much limited. Therefore it is a very inaccurate phrase to speak of the freedom of election. It is a limited freedom. It is a freedom only between one or two candidates who are submitted to the electors, candidates who are very strictly controlled as to how they shall be submitted to the electors. And, my Lords, this close political caucus affects Dot only the choice of the individual candidates who are submitted to the electors, but controls the independence of the candidates when elected. Everybody is familiar with what. I am describing, and knows how a member of Parliament, when he is elected, is affected and controlled by the political organisations of
<col>244</col>
his constituency. This subject forms a topic which has been dealt with by many speakers, but by none more eloquently and strikingly than by the noble Earl who is the author of this Resolution in a speech which he delivered a few weeks ago in the City. In that speech he was describing what I have ventured to describe in much less felicitous terms&#x2014;the effect of the Party system upon the House of Commons, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"It has crashed out almost all independence from the House of Commons."</quote>
These blemishes are, to a large extent, inevitable in any electoral system. I do not mean, of course, that the great representative House of this country could get on without any electoral system. An electoral system, of course, is of its essence, and therefore we must make the best of it. It has enormous advantages. It is a great method of governing a free people, but it has its great blemishes. But, my Lords, the noble Earl upon the Cross Benches in this same speech went on to compare the House of Commons, in which he had said the Party system has crushed out almost all independence, with another Assembly, and this is what he said&#x2014;
<quote>"But there is another institution which I will hardly venture to name at this time and place, which is recognised by the Constitution as an integral part of Parliament, and which has this advantage, at any rate, that it is the only political Assembly that I am acquainted with in this country where it is possible to utter, with perfect freedom, perfect ease, and perfect sufferance, unpalatable truths."</quote>
The noble Earl was speaking of your Lordships' House. The, noble Earl is specially entitled to make that observation, for I have heard him more than once utter unpalatable truths in your Lordships' House. Sometimes I did not quite agree that they were truths, though I am quite certain the noble Earl thought they were, but I am quite sure they were very often unpalatable.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, if it be true that almost all independence has been crushed out of the House of Commons, and if in that respect the House of Commons forms a marked contrast with your Lordships' House under the present system and with all the supposed evils of hereditary right, are we to be expected to discard hereditary right without a sigh and without a groan? I cannot take that view. I share the noble Earl's appreciation of the contrast between
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0148"/>
<col>245</col>
the two Houses of Parliament, but it does not seem to me to load to the conclusion that we ought to totally and at once, abolish the hereditary right. Hereditary right was treated with a certain amount of disdain by the noble Earl last night. Yet hereditary right is the system under which the greater part of the world is governed. Hereditary right relies not on controlling a man by turning him out if you do not agree with him, but in trusting a man because of his sense of public duty and his determination to do right. The hereditary principle means that a man reverences the example of his father. It means that he is determined not to prejudice the position and prospects of his son. I believe that to rely upon those things which are dictated by Nature, and to enlist thereby all the security which Nature itself helps to provide, is, in the main, a far more reliable source of confidence than any other. But it might be said, if so, am I in favour of no change? Not so, my Lords. I venture to think that a change&#x2014;a considerable change&#x2014;is called for in the present position to which our affairs have arrived. But I should like first of all to draw two conclusions from what I have laid before your Lordships. In the first place, having regard to what I call these blemishes in the; reputation of the House of Commons, we ought to be all the more determined to resist the single-Chamber solution of the present difficulty; and, secondly, in determining the changes which ought to take place in our House we ought to profit by what has happened in the House of Commons.<lb/>
It may be that those who propose an elective system are satisfied that a certain element of elective Peers would be a good thing, and that you could rest at that point. Well, my Lords, I hope before we decide upon admitting an elective element we shall be quite sure that that conclusion is just. Is it reasonable to believe that, having admitted a certain electoral element, we could stay there and go no further? I think there is grave reason to doubt that. I do not read in that way the teaching of history. Take the question of Parliamentary reform in another place. There were reformers in the early part of the Nineteenth Century who believed they could go a certain distance and no further. They believed in finality; but events proved them wrong. They had to go from step to step.
<col>246</col>
First they had to reduce the franchise in the boroughs, and then they had to reduce it in the counties, in order to fit the franchise in the boroughs. That is a good example of how difficult it is to draw an arbitrary line and to say you are going a certain distance and no further. For my part, until I am quite satisfied that a line can be not only drawn, but can be maintained, I should be very loth to consider an elective system.<lb/>
But I am in favour, as I said just now, of considerable modification in the constitution of this House, and for this reason. In the first place, the loss of reputation in the other House of Parliament throws greater responsibilities upon your Lordships' Houses. Their procedure&#x2014;I will not dwell upon it, because it has been often discussed here&#x2014;under which Bills are sent up for your consideration large parts of which have hardly been discussed at all, throws a great responsibility upon this House. And, secondly, the more extreme doctrines which prevail among certain sections of opinion in that House, and which seem to have a very formidable influence upon the counsels of the Party to which His Majesty's Government belong&#x2014;that also throws an additional and very grave responsibility upon your Lordships' House. Are we, then, fit to bear this additional responsibility? There is, as it were, a new situation. It is not as if we had to go on in the old hum-drum way. We have to meet a new state of things&#x2014;a Government largely in the hands of the extreme Liberal and Socialist Party; a Government acting by a procedure in the House of Commons which is really the very negation of a deliberative method. Those conditions do throw a very grave responsibility upon this House, and make it necessary that we should fit ourselves to receive and to bear that responsibility.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, what line should we adopt? I have ventured to express my feeling of appreciation for the hereditary principle, but, of course, it has its weakness. My noble friend Lord Onslow and other noble Lords have called attention to it. There are a certain number of your Lordships who have not the aptitude, not the interest which fits them for the discharge of their important duties. Perhaps there are some even who are not worthy to discharge them. Undoubtedly such a state of things
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0149"/>
<col>247</col>
does call for a diminution in the numbers of your Lordships' House; it calls for some process of selection by which those, and those only, who are fitted to discharge such duties should, if possible, be left. Greatly as I value the hereditary principle, in the words of the Resolution of my noble friend "by itself" it is not sufficient. To my mind the importance of those two words have not been done quite justice to in this debate. If I vote, as I hope to vote, for the Motion of the noble Earl, it is not to condemn the hereditary principle, but to condemn the hereditary principle "by itself." That appears to me to be of the very essence of the Motion.<lb/>
There must be some process of selection by which there will be a personal guarantee of the fitness of a particular Peer; not merely that he is the son of his father, but that he also is fitted for the discharge of these functions. There have been many suggestions with this object. There is the well-known suggestion that your Lordships should select a certain number of your own body to be the Lords of Parliament. By all means let us consider such a solution as that. It will achieve a great deal if Peers are selected by their own brethren, just as the Irish Peers are now selected. That would be a very valuable method of reducing the numbers of your Lordships' House and preserving as Lords of Parliament those who are qualified to perform that important function. But perhaps it may be said that selection of a certain number of your Lordships by the whole body of the House is not sufficient; that the great democracy may desire to have some guarantee over which they would have some control. I certainly should not exclude some arrangement with that object, so long only as the independence of your Lordships' House is preserved. By independence I mean that your Lordships should be able to act and speak and vote according to your consciences, without feeling that the result of indulging in your conscience would be the loss of your seat on the next occasion when your appointment came to be made. That appears to me to be the one thing above all others which we must avoid. Above all things, we must preserve the independence of your Lordships in the exercise of your duty. Is it impossible to combine a democratic influence over the appointment, say, of a certain section of your Lordships with this independence?<lb/>
The independence of this House does not depend so much upon its hereditary charac-
<col>248</col>
ter as upon the fact that your Lordships, once appointed, are irremovable. We are in the same position, for example, as the Judges. The Judges are irremovable, and therefore they are independent. It is the same with the Law Lords&#x2014;those members of your Lordships' House who are Lords of Appeal. They are not hereditary, but they are irremovable and therefore they are independent. I do not doubt that that was the reason above all others why the Judges were made irremovable&#x2014;in order that they should be independent. But both in the case of the Judges and of the Lords of Appeal the great democracy certainly does have a voice, and a most emphatic voice, in their appointment, for who appoints them? Why, the Crown; and the Crown is advised in these matters, as every one knows, by the Minister who is the elect of the people. The Minister represents the majority of the House of Commons. He is the man who is chosen by the process of election in the House of Commons and the votes of its members to enjoy the confidence of the great democracy of this country. He is the greatest democratic influence in the country, and in his hands lie the recommendations to the Crown which determine who are to be the Judges or who are to be the Lords of Appeal in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
If, then, there is to be a democratic title as well as a hereditary title in your Lordships' House, let it be by means of appointment through the Crown&#x2014;that is, upon the recommendation of a Minister. But, above all things, let the House remain independent. Your Lordships are aware that this suggestion of appointment by the Crown finds a place in a great number of the constitutions which are proposed for your Lordships' House. There is what is called the proposal of life Peerages; that is, of course, appointments by the Crown to your Lordships' House for life. For life, be it remembered! That is to say, they are irremovable, and therefore they are independent. That is a very good proposal, but it lacks one thing. It lacks the hereditary element. They are life Peers appointed from outside your Lordships' House. Why not combine the two? Why should you not have a system under which members of the hereditary Peerage would be nominated for life to serve as Lords of Parliament? I do not say that the whole House should consist of Lords of Parliament appointed in such a manner, although personally I would be
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0150"/>
<col>249</col>
prepared to go a long way in that respect; but if you do wish to go further on what I may call the Irish model then I submit that the proper direction in which to look for a solution is towards the appointment of members of the hereditary Peerage for life by the Crown. Your Lordships will observe that such a proposal would be perfectly fair as between the two Parties.<lb/>
The point has been made&#x2014;I think it was made by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, last night&#x2014;that in no solution which has been proposed was there any attempt to strengthen the Liberal Party. I am not sure that we ought to go about with the express purpose of strengthening the Liberal Party in your Lordships' House, but I would ask the noble Viscount to observe that such a solution as that, entrusting as it does in the case of these particular Lords of Parliament their appointment to the Minister of the day, places the Liberal Party in precisely as good a position as the Unionist Party. The Minister, if he happens to be, as he is at this moment, a Liberal Minister, would have the opportunity of recommending to the Crown hereditary Peers of his own political complexion and thought to serve as Lords of Parliament. The effect which such a system would have upon the composition of your Lordships' House would be not only fair but gradual; it would be gradual, step by step, as vacancies occurred, and it would preserve what, above all things, I believe to be essential to the proper conduct of a Second Chamber&#x2014;the independence of the members who composed it.<lb/>
I was grateful to the most rev. Primate for the counsel which he gave that any reforms which we or the country undertake should be of a moderate character. I have no desire for the vast revolutionary changes which find favour upon the other side of the House. Moreover, I do not desire, any more than my noble friends who sit behind me, any fundamental change in the powers of your Lordships' House. I do not want to see them diminished. I do not want to see them increased. We took a strong step in the winter of last year, but, so far as I am concerned, any counsel which I ventured to give to your Lordships on that occasion was not with the view of increasing the power of your Lordships' House. It was because I believed that the policy of the Government in the Finance Bill struck a fatal blow at the power of your Lordships' House that I was anxious that it should be rejected. So far
<col>250</col>
as I was concerned, the rejection of the Finance Bill was essentially defensive and not aggressive. I do not wish, and do not suggest, that there should be any increase of powers in your Lordships' House. I do not want it to have more influence over the finances of the country than was the case in the years which have preceded the one in which I am now speaking; but I do think that to diminish the powers of your Lordships' House, to allow the other House to ride rough-shod over our decisions, would be to destroy, and destroy absolutely, any use there may be in a Second Chamber. Therefore let us, so far as we are able, adhere to our powers, but let us give a hearty welcome to the Motion of the noble Earl upon the Cross Benches, so that we may make ourselves more fit even than before to discharge the great and important functions of the State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00685">[Lord STANMORE, Lord NEWTON, and Lord SHEFFIELD rose together to address the House, but the two first-named gave way.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00686"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two speeches on that side have been heard this afternoon, so I think it is only fair that somebody should be heard on this side. The debate, so far, has been conducted almost entirely by noble Lords who are more or less in complete sympathy with the Motion before the House, and subject to certain criticisms in detail the speech we have just listened to seemed to be a speech that the House might have heard when it had gone into Committee upon the Resolution rather than a speech upon the Motion itself. I gathered that it was not the wish of the majority of this House to discuss the details of a scheme on the first Resolution. I am perfectly willing to fall in with that view and I do not propose to discuss the details of a scheme, but to discuss the point of view of those who are advocating the proposal of the noble Earl as a solution of the present political difficulty.<lb/>
I wish to direct my attention more specially to the speech of the most rev. Primate. He dwelt with great force upon the fact that in the history of this country changes have come rather by acquiescence than by statutory enactment, and he pointed out, with perfect truth, that this informal method of quietly modifying the Constitution required great tact and great judgment on all sides, and that if an assertion of right was made upon privilege and custom, it strained the situation,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0151"/>
<col>251</col>
and might strain it almost to the breaking point. The most rev. Primate took us back to ancient history, and very suitably referred to the action of a great predecessor of his own in the Chair of St. Augustine, and the part he took at Runnymede. Runnymede is more remote than Oliver Cromwell, of whom we heard a great deal yesterday, but it bears more on the present question, and I do not think we should be wrong to pause for a moment and think what was the action of the people through the prelates and chief nobles who had the principal power in the country in dealing with the rudimentary Constitution of this country and amending it. In the time of the Norman Kings and the earlier Plantagenets the prerogative of the King was everything, and the rights of the subject were very minute. If we could call it a Constitution, it was a Constitution of custom. The custom was found insufficient in the time of King John, when these prelates and Barons had no hesitation in bringing in a Statute and enacting a Magna Charta for the rights of the people. But the danger to the rights of the people has been more from the Crown than from the House of Lords, and therefore if we study history we find that statutory modifications of the Constitution have been directed against the power of the Crown. This country has never hesitated to modify its Constitution by Statute whenever it thought it necessary.<lb/>
Let me give your Lordships an illustration. No doubt the power of the Crown was very high in the time of the Tudors, but Queen Elizabeth had enough sense, although she had a great clinging to power, to use that tact to which the most rev. Primate referred, and to adjust her difficulties with her subjects without straining things to the breaking point. The Stuarts, unfortunately, seem to me to have borne a greater resemblance to the House of Lords. They took advantage of the letter of the law; they strained the law, and brought about such a conflict as ended in the greatest clash of rights and powers that the history of this country has ever witnessed. Your Lordships have been talking now as though the great object was to make some modification of the constitution and composition of the House which would apparently satisfy the public without sacrifice of the real essence of your power. But your Lordships make a great mistake if you suppose that at the present moment the questions which the
<col>252</col>
people up and down the country are concerned in coming to a settlement with you upon are merely those of your constitution and not the powers that you exercise. I do not deny that both are main questions, but in the whole of this debate you have talked only of your constitution, and if you have mentioned your powers it has been with the demand that you should not see them diminished.<lb/>
But in the opinion of a great many people outside this House this is a question which will not go back. Whatever may be the political vicissitudes for the next ten or fifteen years, this question which has been raised has come to stay; and the great question is whether what was believed by everyone to be the custom and rule of the Constitution, that the representatives of the people should be supreme in finance, should still remain the law and custom of the nation. Until that question is settled and until you acknowledge that you overstepped the limit last autumn when you threw out the Budget and refused the Supplies necessary to carry on the Government, there will be no settlement of this question however you may tinker at your composition. The most rev. Primate told us a good deal of what other people said; he gave us a graphic description of what the friends of the House of Commons and the friends of the House of Lords say. But he told us very little of what he himself would say, and I could not help feeling that his speech to-day was rather an echo of his action in November, when, seeing that there was a great chasm, he took one look at the precipice and walked away in the opposite direction. But the most rev. Primate did, notwithstanding, drop one word. It came very incidentally in the course of his speech. Perhaps some of your Lordships hardly noticed it; but he said he was in favour of some readjustment of the Constitution and also to some extent of the work of the House of Lords. He did not amplify it. We do look to the successor of Prelates who have been prominent in vindicating public rights against usurpation for a lead. I did think that perhaps in the Twentieth as in the Thirteenth Century, we might have had some indication and lead in guiding us to a decision. But we got nothing but a hint. There is a great advantage in constitutional custom as long as that custom is observed. I suppose there is no greater example of custom in directing and caring
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0152"/>
<col>253</col>
for and governing also a legislative body than the history of the Roman Republic. There the great officers of State had many and conflicting rights, and if they had used them to the utmost chaos would have come; but by their tact and experience they had the sense for centuries to see that no person pushed his rights to the extreme. But when that political tact fails, then you have to define the positions of various bodies by law; and I am no more unwilling to define the rights of either House of Parliament by law than our forefathers were unwilling to define the rights of the Crown by law.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate seemed to speak as though the rights and constitution of either House were entirely within its own purview and consideration; but surely we must; all see that, whatever the outcome of the proposal of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches may be, no change can come about in the constitution of this House without an Act of Parliament. You cannot by Resolution turn out Peers who have a right to sit here. If once you begin to think that you can meddle by Resolution of this House with those rights, recollect that none of you sit here except by the Royal Writ of Summons, which is also a matter of centuries of custom, as are many other parts of the government of this country. Therefore I say if you begin to touch the constitution of this House you cannot keep clear of an Act of Parliament. I quite agree that all through the Middle Ages the rights of the people through their representatives were asserted as a matter of privilege, and I do not know that they were put on any Statute Book. But the right of the House of Commons to have control of finance is not set out in any Statute; it is to be found in the immemorial common law of the Constitution. But, of course, if you are determined to re-open those questions, I do not know that anyone could take a point of order against you. If you were to introduce a Money Bill, the only thing that would happen to it would be that it would be flung contemptuously out of the House of Commons when it reached that Assembly. The moment you break away from custom you will have to be regulated by law.<lb/>
I wish to say one word on a point made by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches regarding the Constitution of other countries.
<col>254</col>
I do not wish to go into details, but I think we have to study the practice of the United Kingdom and its customs and institutions in settling our own political difficulties, and We shall get very little, profit from looking at the customs and habits of other nations. The Senate of the United States, for example, has no relation to what we call the Upper House in the United Kingdom. It is of the essence of the government of the United States, because it is a Federation of States and not a separate government. The Senate represents the rights of the several States as distinct from the rights of individual citizens, and belongs to an entirely different set of considerations. As to the British Colonies, I would like to know whether, if any colony were offered, in place of its present Second Chamber, a body of hereditary legislators like the House of Lords, it would not at once say that, sooner than have such a Second Chamber, it would forfeit the advantages of a Second Chamber and have single-Chamber government.<lb/>
People have thrown out challenges to us as to whether we are Second Chamber men. I may say that I am very strongly a Second Chamber man, for many reasons. I do not believe, with the complicated responsibilities in connection with foreign and colonial affairs that with the weight of centuries have come down upon us, we can do without a Second Chamber. I will go further and say that it should be a good, capable Second Chamber that could command the respect of the country and speak with authority. But you must have supreme power lodged somewhere. You cannot divide supreme power. Whether you like the word "predominant" or not, the fact remains that you are trying at this minute to steal away from the House of Commons some of the predominance that must remain with it if this country is to be properly governed. If you use your legal right to paralyse the whole administration of the country and refuse to provide funds necessary to support the Army and the Navy, what is that but attacking the House of Commons? If you once begin to use your legal rights not for the purpose of criticising legislation in the true sense but for paralysing the administration of the country, you will have to give way before that body which, being chosen by the people, must be the supreme and dominant power in the country.<lb/>

The noble Marquess who last spoke told us that he had sat for seventeen years in the House of Commons, and that during his lifetime&#x2014;and he went in there as a young man&#x2014;he had witnessed a steady deterioration in that House. I am not prepared to agree with him; but I think he might have recalled that during most of that period you had a Tory Government and a Tory majority in the House of Commons. But in spite of that, I do not think the House of Commons has deteriorated, although its composition has not been always in harmony with my views. I do not know whether the House of Commons or the people of this country will quite like the suggestion that because the House of Commons is growing more and more out of touch and out of sympathy with your Lordships therefore this House must assert itself more resolutely than ever, must put on some appearance of popular constitution, in order to conciliate the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of the country, and then in order to exert greater power in the government of the country must put a check on legislation from this House of Commons which you think is deteriorating. I do not know whether that contention of your Lordships will commend itself to the people of the country. The noble Marquess spoke, towards the close of his speech, of "the terrible day," when the Labour Party and the Socialists formed the Government of the country, and said that then this House was to be a bulwark. I feel perfectly certain that when the Labour Party and the Socialists constitute the Government of the country they will make very short work of your Lordships and you will not be able to stand against them. It is because of the general moderation of the country and the reforms which have been carried that the Labour Party and the Socialists are not governing the country. They are citizens of this country and have a right to be heard like everyone else; they have to take their place in the conflict of politics and be represented according to their powers. You will not prevent their coming into power by assuming to yourselves arrogant pretensions which have not belonged to you in the past, or posing as bulwarks of society against their inroads. The noble Marquess said that last Autumn he and the House took a strong step. I beg to differ entirely from him. The step then taken was a violent one, but that it was not a strong one experience has shown.</membercontribution></p>

<col>256</col>
Lord who has just sat down warned us in what was intended to be impressive tones that we are about to attempt what is an impossibility&#x2014;namely, to carry out the purposes and the objects of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches by means of Resolutions. Surely everybody knows that an Act of Parliament is necessary, and I presume that these Resolutions, which no doubt will shortly be adopted, are merely preliminary to a Bill, and that Bill, if it is not accepted by the present Government, will in all probability be accepted when a Unionist Administration comes into power again. Listening to the various speeches which have been made during the last two days, I could not help being reminded of my experience three years ago, when, with perhaps unjustifiable temerity, I brought certain proposals before this House, not my own proposals at all but the proposals of other people put together in the shape of a Bill. I am bound to say my modest efforts were not received with much enthusiasm in any quarter. I may observe that they were received with less enthusiasm from the Front Opposition Bench than almost anywhere else. My noble friend Lord Cawdor, who was put up to move what was humorously described as a "friendly Amendment," displayed so little friendliness towards my proposal that I was under the impression he had mistaken his instructions and was about to embark upon the task of moving the rejection of the Bill. And therefore it was all the greater gratification to me afterwards to observe the gradual process of conversion on the part of the noble Lord, and to see him vote consistently in the Committee of which he and I were members for proposals which he had previously denounced in this House.<lb/>
There has, I admit been some advance in opinion towards Lord Rosebery's proposals. The noble Marquess who spoke just now made use of the expression that he extended a kindly welcome, what he called a warm welcome, to those proposals. It did not strike me as being a welcome of a particularly warm nature, but, at all events, it was an advance on previous performances. Looking round the benches on this side of the House I am again conscious of a certain inclination in favour of the proposals for the reform of this House, and I attribute this advance in opinion largely to the experiences which were acquired by numerous noble Lords who sit around me during what was termed by the Liberal Press "the campaign
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0154"/>
<col>257</col>
of wild Peers "which was productive of so many incidents. But there are two parties in this House which throughout this controversy have remained perfectly consistent. One is the party represented by the noble and learned Earl below me, Lord Halsbury. I do not know how many followers he can count, but the noble Earl still continues, if I do not mistake him, to present an adamantine front to all these revolutionary proposals, and I do not for a moment think that one General Election, or even several, would alter his views upon the subject. And the other party which is equally consistent in its attitude in regard to this question is, of course, the Government. We have had two speeches from the Government Front Bench since the debate began, and I hope I shall not be accused of disrespect if I assert that they were not of a particularly illuminating nature. The only tangible fact that I was able to gather from the speech of the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture was that he was closely related to a high dignitary of the Church&#x2014;a fact which does not seem to bear very closely upon the present controversy.<lb/>
The attitude of the Government remains precisely to-day what it was three years ago. Their object is to prevent any kind of improvement in this place, whether by change or otherwise. The only change which they contemplate and favour is to turn this place into a kind of elaborate sham, a sort of hybrid between a registry office and a debating society, and a place which is to fulfil the double function of serving as a reward to deserving members of the Liberal Party, and at the same time to afford a horrible object lesson to the electorate. This somewhat contradictory course is one which calls for some ingenuity, though not, perhaps, for more ingenuity than the Government possess. It is not uncommon to hear the policy of the Government with regard to this House described as fatuous. I do not look upon it as fatuous at all. On the other hand, I look upon that policy as being from their own point of view essentially a common sense policy, provided you do not seriously attack this place, provided that the House of Lords question is skilfully handled by a Liberal Government. When I say Liberal Government I wish to distinguish the Government from their Irish allies and the Socialists who masquerade as Labour Members, and so forth. From the point of view of a purely Liberal
<col>258</col>
Government an unreformed House of Lords is a perfectly invaluable asset to them in some particulars, and I cannot help thinking that many of them must be well aware of it and must be deeply regretting the campaign in which they are now involved.<lb/>
Consider for a moment the advantages which an unreformed House of Lords offers from a tactical and wire-pulling point of view, which is, of course, the only point of view from which the Government would regard it. It has enabled all moderate men in the Party, and I suppose even now there are still some moderate men in the Liberal Party, to vote steadily for measures in another place which they feel confident will be rejected when they, reach here. It has provided an excellent excuse for not dealing with questions which are highly favoured by the Party but which are not so popular in the country. I think the majority of people have at length realised the somewhat important fact that the Liberal Party and the people of this country, with a big "P," are no longer the same thing. The third advantage, not an inconsiderable one, is that if by any chance a member of this House shows himself to be an unsatisfactory or a foolish kind of person it has always been open to Radical orators to maintain that the whole of the House of Lords consists of persons of that description. Lastly, it has been the means of rewarding estimable gentlemen for valuable and substantial services which they have rendered, in the past to the Liberal cause. The bestowal of a Peerage upon a deserving Liberal gentleman always seems to me to be accompanied by a phenomenon which we do not observe in connection with other forms of dispensation of honours. It is a sort of double-edged business. On the one hand, you confer an honour upon a man, but on the other hand you exact a substantial sacrifice from him, because it must be perfectly obvious that there is considerable sacrifice involved in the case of a gentleman who enters an Assembly which he has been abusing during the whole course of his previous years. There is a certain amount of martyrdom involved, but the curious thing is that there always appears to be a large number of public-spirited Liberal gentlemen who are ready to undergo this particular form of martyrdom, of which the coronet is not an inappropriate symbol. It stands to reason that when
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0155"/>
<col>259</col>
these gentlemen enter this place they are subjected to an almost intolerable strain, and very often it is more than they can stand. Something snaps, their political equilibrium gives way, they desert their posts and come over to the enemy.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, in spite of the determined opposition which was offered by the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, and by the Government to any proposals of reform with regard to this House, three years ago a Committee was appointed to consider the various proposals put forward, and for my part I feel profoundly grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, that he has at last forced this question to the front, and that we have got to express an opinion upon those proposals. Although I never found anyone who agreed with me, it always seemed to me highly desirable that the findings of that Committee should have been considered long ago. I confess it always appeared to me that if you openly admitted something had got to be done and appointed a Committee to consider what ought to be done, when that Committee made certain recommendations the obvious course was to consider those recommendations without delay. It would have been a more dignified and courageous course to discuss this question earlier rather than wait until the wreckers in another place have produced their programme. It is no use, I know, repining over lost time; but with regard to this particular Report I observe that the prevailing tendency at the present moment is to regard it as totally inadequate. Inadequate is the word which is used. And yet part of its proposals is that between 200 and 300 members of this House should be excluded from it. I hardly think that two years ago anybody would have used the word inadequate with regard to the recommendation of this Committee. As a matter of fact I contend that it only requires alteration in one important point in order to extract all the reforms which any reasonable person can desire. At the same time it seems to me that recommendations of this Committee, which have been carefully considered by members of this House, are worthy of a great deal more attention than the innumerable schemes which are being put forward by constitution-makers who are so vastly enjoying themselves.<lb/>
I am not a particular respecter of persons, but I do maintain that the composition of
<col>260</col>
this Committee entitled its Report to most careful consideration and respect. Let me recall to the House the persons who took part in those proceedings. It was presided over by an ex-Prime Minister, and its members included an ex-Foreign Minister, an ex-Lord Chancellor, the most rev. Primate, an ex-Speaker, ex-Viceroys, and several ex-Secretaries of State. In fact, with the exception of myself and two or three inconspicuous persons whose names, of course, I will not mention, the Committee consisted entirely of distinguished persons, and for my part I do not anticipate that I shall ever move in such distinguished political circles again. The appointment of this Committee was a landmark in the history of the House. It was the first serious attempt that had been made to deal with the question of reform. But owing to the policy that the Government pursued of ignoring the existence of this Committee we are still, to a great extent, in the dark as to what are the feelings of the House generally with regard to it. I must admit that when this Report appeared it was received with what amounted to little short of absolutely stony indifference. I hardly heard an opinion on the subject, excepting in the case of one noble Lord, a very infrequent attendant at the House, who was so indignant at the recommendations that he announced his intention of at once cultivating rhetoric for the purpose of overwhelming the proposer of the recommendations when they appeared.<lb/>
The reason the Committee's recommendations did not receive the treatment to which they were entitled is perfectly plain. This Report came out with an absolute and complete disregard of what I may term political scenic effects. It was brought out at a time when people were thinking of entirely different things. It came out almost simultaneously with the withdrawal of one of the Education Bills of the Government and immediately after the rejection of the Licensing Bill, and that is one of the reasons why sufficient attention has never been paid to it. If anybody will take the trouble to read the Report he will see at once that the members of the Committee, as was pointed out by the noble Earl yesterday, recognised frankly and immediately the more glaring defects of this House. As for those defects, I think I can crystalise them in three or four words. I will put it shortly in this way&#x2014;We are too numerous and we are too one-sided. By a strange and curious paradox we are now about to penalise ourselves
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0156"/>
<col>261</col>
for what appears to be somewhat inadequate reasons. It really is not our fault that we are too numerous. That is the fault of successive Governments in consequence of the number of Peers they have created from time to time.<lb/>
As for the other fault, the so-called fault of being too one-sided&#x2014;that is to say, being too Conservative&#x2014;that is the greatest possible tribute to the honesty of this Assembly, because I have not the smallest hesitation in asserting that of all the temptations which beset the politician by far the strongest is to join the Party of noble Lords opposite. It is the one profession in the world, where greatness is deliberately thrust upon you, and you can hardly avoid it however hard you may try. Noble Lords opposite rise almost automatically to dizzy heights of grandeur, and they are invested at the same time&#x2014;by the Liberal Press only, I must admit&#x2014;with all the attributes of genius and the graces of oratory, whilst we who languish here upon the Back Benches are represented as a mass of inarticulate yokels, probably with vicious instincts into the bargain. Not only do noble Lords opposite enjoy these advantages in the present, but they are guaranteed to them in the future, because, under every scheme that I have seen put forward for the reform of this House, the future existence of these noble Lords is most carefully provided for. In spite of this, an unjust world refuses to recognise the rugged honesty which animates the great majority of the members of this House. Instead of crediting us with rugged honesty, the belief prevails&#x2014;encouraged by Home Secretaries and Chancellors of the Exchequer&#x2014;that we are a partial Assembly which exists for the purpose of destroying or mutilating beneficent Liberal legislation.<lb/>
We may wish to be impartial, and we are impartial much more than people commonly suppose; but at the same time it must be candidly admitted, though I do not like doing it, that appearances are against us. That is really the strong point of our adversaries' case. There is in this House no clear and evident appearance of impartiality, although it does exist; and, though it is very wrong of me to do so, I cannot help sympathising for once in a way with noble Lords opposite in the position in which they find themselves. Their contention, and the contention of their followers in the country, is that this House never interferes with Conservative legislation, but destroys and mutilates
<col>262</col>
Liberal legislation. They complain, with some justice, that they labour and toil in the wilderness for years, and that when they come into power with an enormous majority they are liable to see their measures upset by the permanent majority which is encamped here. As I say, I do sympathise with them, and I confess that if an umpire habitually decided against me I should perhaps entertain some doubts as to his impartiality before I had finished. No doubt the Government feel deeply the rejection of their measures, but I suspect that the people who feel more deeply still are those ardent and convinced Radicals who have set their heart upon some particular project which, when it conies up here, is defeated by noble lords who, they believe, skip up from Newmarket or Monte Carlo or some place of the kind where Peers are habitually supposed to dwell, and who come here only for the purpose of destroying those beneficent measures.<lb/>
What is the real grievance against this House? I do not think it has been clearly pointed out in the debate yet. The real grievance against this House is not that it is unrepresentative&#x2014;that is not really the grievance at all&#x2014;but that it is not sufficiently Liberal. If it treated the legislation of both sides equally we should hear nothing whatever about the unrepresentative character of this House, and the Radical Party would be content to put up with whoever the members of this House were, provided they did their bidding. I remember in the debate which took place three years ago that the noble Earl the Leader of this House, when we were discussing the question of excluding unworthy members, members who have been described as "black sheep," explained that the colour of the sheep did not worry him at all. He did not mind what the colour of the sheep was, but what he objected to was their gregarious habits. In other words, the noble Earl and his friends apparently do not care much who the people are who constitute this House provided they will vote with them. Here is where the difficulty of the reformer comes in, and it lies at the root of the question. What you want to do, when all is said and done, is to convey not only an appearance but a character of impartiality, and that is the aim to which the efforts of all reformers are directed.<lb/>
Up to a certain point there is very little difficulty in coming to an agreement. I
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0157"/>
<col>263</col>
hink I am justified in assuming that every one, or practically every one with the exception of the noble and learned Earl below me (Lord Halsbury), will accept the proposition that the hereditary principle must be modified. Everybody, I suspect, will also agree that the hereditary principle is to be retained in some shape or other. They will also agree that a number&#x2014;I do not know whether a large number or not, but a certain number&#x2014;of persons will have to go; and, of course, the persons who will be pricked upon on paper as having to go will be the 250 Peers who during the course of last session attended here fewer than ten times. All this looks very well upon paper, but, as I shall show presently, it is not quite clear that you will be able to get rid of these undesirable people. I think I may go further and say that the methods by which it is proposed to carry out this winnowing or sifting process, that of qualification and of election from inside this House, are also approved in principle. As I am on that point, I should like to be allowed to express my strong preference for the former system. I believe that every noble Lord who took part in the electoral campaign must have found when he was defending the House of Lords that the argument which was applied with the greatest force and met with the most approval from audiences was that nobody should sit here unless he had done something to deserve his seat. When we were discussing the Budget last year the noble Earl upon the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery, made a proposal that 150 people should be delegated to represent the majority in this House, and I have often been rather curious in my own mind as to how that suggestion would have been carried out if it had been adopted. Whatever people may say, I expect everybody in his heart considers he is just as good as anybody else. I know, speaking for myself, that I should certainly have voted for myself as one of the noble Earl's nominees, and I venture to say that every backwoodsman who bad come up on the occasion would have voted for himself and have got, so to speak, his political money's worth.<lb/>
If we are going to embark upon the principle of election these difficulties will occur. There will, first of all, be extreme difficulty in carrying out the election. It is proposed that the Peers should be elected upon the minority system, therefore everybody would have, let us say, 200 votes. If 200 persons were to be elected, the prospect of
<col>264</col>
200 backwoodsmen armed with 200 votes apiece might produce some rather remarkable results. Does it follow, as is confidently assumed, that if this plan were adopted&#x2014;and I have no doubt it will be adopted because it is the best compromise that has been suggested&#x2014;that the best men would be elected? The best men are not necessarily the most popular men in an Assembly. Very often the most useful are the most boring members of an Assembly. What really would happen, of course, everybody knows perfectly well. It would be that the election would ultimately fall into the hands of the Whips. For myself, I have the most profound distrust of Whips&#x2014;in their official and not in their personal capacity. What is the object of the Whip? The object and the duty of a Whip is, I take it, to provide gentlemen who will come here when they are wanted, and perhaps, what is more important still, who will keep away when they are not wanted. A Whip does not want people to come here and talk about all sorts of awkward subjects and put the Front Benches in a hole. The result will be that the election will fall into the hands of the Whips, and anybody who shows traces or originality and is likely to cause trouble will be scrupulously left out. They will concentrate their energies on obtaining a docile body of men who can be counted upon to go anywhere and do anything at the command of the Government of the day.<lb/>
A short time ago these proposals to sift this House by a system of qualification and by a system of inter-election, added to the principle of making life Peers, would have been considered not only adequate but almost revolutionary. Now I gather it is looked upon merely in the light of a friendly family arrangement. It is very curious what a remarkable effect the election experiences have had upon many members of this House. Considering that the Election resulted in the drawn battle, it can hardly be said to justify, logically, the extreme kind of reform which has been proposed by some people. Take, for instance, the question of election from outside. When I was a member of the Committee of which I have spoken I own to having voted against this proposal, but I have become a convert since. It appears to me that what was good enough two years ago is not good enough now. For my part, I am entirely in agreement with the noble Earl on the Cross Benches with regard to this question. What I think has been borne in upon those noble
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0158"/>
<col>265</col>
Lords who took part in the recent Election is that the present state of things is indefensible in theory, that you cannot defend it in principle, and that, therefore, you can hardly represent it to the voters as being tenable in practice. There is one tangible thing which you certainly cannot recommend, and that is the absolutely hopeless and almost futile position in which noble Lords opposite are placed in the House by reason of the small and permanent minority which they represent.<lb/>
While I entertain the idea that reform should proceed, if possible, on historic lines so as not to make too great a breach with the past, I have come to the conclusion that an elective element will have to be provided as well if we are going to retain the confidence of the democracy and of the country. What I feel strongly is that it is no good making a sort of half-hearted sacrifice at the present time. I do not think it would be the slightest use to throw 100 or 200 "backwoodsmen" to the democratic wolves. There would not be much self-sacrifice involved in that. Besides it does not even follow that you would get rid of them. <i>Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret</i>. You might expel the backwoodsman by the front door, but he might reappear down the chimney or through the window. I would like to urge&#x2014;and I urge it with great respect upon noble Lords&#x2014;that the time has come when we really must show that we are prepared to make a substantial sacrifice. Hitherto we have not been called upon to sacrifice much beyond our convictions. We are now going to be called upon to sacrifice our privileges, and as far as I am concerned one of the privileges which I valued most highly has already been taken away because we no longer enjoy that immunity from taking part in contested elections which I always estimated to be one of the great advantages of being a member of this House.<lb/>
I apologise for having detained the House. What I desire to say in conclusion is this. If the changes proposed by the noble Earl take place this House will certainly be a much less agreeable place than it is at the present moment. It will probably be filled with a large number of assertive and self-satisfied persons who will completely alter the tone of this Assembly, and honestly in my own mind I greatly doubt whether its real efficiency will be much improved. I
<col>266</col>
entertain a very strong suspicion amounting almost to a certainty, that the decisions which a reformed House of Lords will arrive at will be precisely the decisions that are arrived at in the present day. But at all events we shall, if these changes are carried out, speak with an authority which we do not possess at the present moment; and instead of constituting what I am afraid is a somewhat frail barrier I think we shall form a solid and substantial defence against those dangers which threaten not only the Constitution but the liberties of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00688"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend on my left is a difficult man to follow, because he is possessed of a wit to which I can lay no claim. But he has dealt, I think, rather with the question of what shape any reform of this House should take than with the main question which was submitted to us by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches&#x2014;namely, the desirability of reform and the reason why reform is necessary. It struck me very much that in the whole course of this debate, until the noble Marquess on the Front Benches rose to-night, scarcely anything was said about what I believe to be one of the main reasons why some change in the constitution of this House is necessary, and that is the condition of the Lower House. It has been the custom until lately of one House to speak of the other with respect, and with a certain amount of restraint. I cannot say that that good custom has been of late altogether preserved in another place, or by those who belong to another place. The noble Earl the Leader of the House told us the other day that there was something very like a state of war existing between the two Houses. I do not know whether the noble Earl quite appreciated the gravity of that statement. We have heard it more than once referred to. The only time in the history of this country when there was war between the two Houses, what were the consequences? I will not further refer to that, but I must remark that you cannot have a war of this kind fought in gloves, and it will be necessary, if this war is to be fought, that we should speak plainly. I desire for one moment to call attention to the state of the House of Commons. The noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, told us just now that he did not see any change in the House of Commons in his experience. He did not tell us why. He did not give any facts to show that the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0159"/>
<col>267</col>
House of the present day is similar to the House of the old days.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00689"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that. I said I did not think it had deteriorated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00690"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord did not give us any facts to show that it had not deteriorated. The only reply of the noble Lord was that easy argument which is, perhaps, one of the comforts of the period of life to which he and I have arrived&#x2014;to say we remember times before the speaker and that we have an experience which the speaker has not got. I was in the House of Commons for a good many years; I am not quite sure whether I was there before Lord Sheffield, but certainly I was with him a good many years, and I am quite astounded that he should say that the House of Commons has not deteriorated since those days. The real truth is that the House of Commons has deteriorated steadily ever since the Reform Bill of 1867, and it has deteriorated with still more celerity since the Reform Bill of 1884. I do not speak merely of the manners of the House; that is no affair of ours; but I speak of the powers of the House and of the way it transacts its business, and of its independence. When I first entered the House of Commons private Members could speak when they liked; they could bring forward Resolutions necessary for discussion, and many of them forced Bills through the House. There are many important measures on the Statute Book which bear the names of private Members who forced those Bills through the House.<lb/>
Now, what is the condition of the present House of Commons? I will not describe it in my own words, because I might be prejudiced. I will take the words of Professor McKechnie, who published a book on the question of the reform of the House of Lords a short time ago, and who is, I may inform the House, lecturer on Constitutional History in Glasgow. Speaking of the functions of this House to check hasty legislation, he says&#x2014;
<quote>"That such a function is at times useful and necessary hardly admits of doubt. The exact direction of its usefulness has, however, somewhat changed in recent years in consequence of the encroachments made by the modern Cabinet on the independence of the House of Commons. The House of Lords, which once stood guard over the action of a too powerful House of Commons, now stands guard over a too powerful Cabinet. In
<col>268</col>
these days of inflexible Party organisation, enforced by threats of Dissolution and by the habitual use of such expedients as the guillotine, it is the Ministry of the day, not the Lower Chamber of the Legislature, which threatens to become omnipotent. The House of Lords is the only barrier, a frail one it may be, that offers resistance to the supremacy of the Cabinet unrestrained and uncontrolled."</quote>
Does the noble Lord tell me that that was the case when he and I entered first the House of Commons?<lb/>
But I confess that this statement requires some modification. It can hardly be said that the supremacy of the present Cabinet is unrestrained and uncontrolled, but the fact that the Cabinet is at the present moment under the lash of Mr. Redmond does not make the matter any better from a constitutional point of view. The events of the last few months have shown that it is possible for the House of Commons, which ordinarily speaking is under the power of the Cabinet, to become, in certain circumstances, under the power of absolutely irresponsible members of Parliament who can fetter its freedom. That is a state of things which I think necessitates some change in the general constitution of Parliament, and when I say of Parliament I mean of both Houses. The only remedy that noble Lords opposite have to suggest is to emasculate this House, to weaken it altogether. If the House will allow me, I will quote again from the author to whom I referred just now. I make these quotations because I think it desirable that we should know what thoughtful, trained intellects, what men whose minds have been given to this Constitutional question, think of the situation, quite apart from the turmoil of politics or any interest that any one of us may be supposed to have. By the way, we do not know what the proposal of the Government is, but it is to weaken the House in some way, and we will assume, for the sake of argument, that it is the Resolution foreshadowed by the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Mr. McKechnie says of it&#x2014;
<quote>"It would leave the House of Lords unreformed in the enjoyment of its purely ornamental and ancient privileges, but deprived of all legislative power. The Commons, after tolerating for a few months the futile criticisms of the Lords, would be empowered to ignore the existence of the Second Chamber and would proceed to pass Statutes on their own authority like the Ordinances of the Long Parliament in the Civil War."</quote>
I cannot believe that noble Lords opposite, or the Government, seriously mean to put
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0160"/>
<col>269</col>
before the country such a proposition as that.<lb/>
What is going to be the position of men whom they delight to honour and whom we are all glad to see honoured? I will take an instance in the late Home Secretary. The late Home Secretary bears an honoured name. He is the son of a very distinguished father, so distinguished that if a Peerage had been conferred upon him simply because of his father's services and not of his own merits it would have been only following a precedent which has often been followed in former years. But he has himself held high office, he has been for a great number of years in Parliament serving his country, and he has just been chosen for a high post abroad. The reward you give that right hon. gentleman for his services is a Peerage which will land him, when he comes back to this country, in a House whose duties would be merely ornamental; he will have no functions of any sort or kind worthy the name, and he will be utterly debarred by the fact of being in this House from ever serving his country as a member of the other House. I cannot believe that any man who has performed such services as these will expect such a degradation as that implies. I cannot believe that any Cabinet or any Government would offer to one of their own trusted colleagues a position which means utter disfranchisement, because I have heard Scotch Peers pitied on account of their not being able to get a seat in the Lower House, and they are the only individuals in the country who are utterly disfranchised. You are going to reduce the right hon. gentleman I have named to practically the same position. All one can say is that this is a curious proceeding on the part of the Government. It is a curious idea they have of solving their difficulties, and it reminds me of nothing so much as the account of the Red Queen in "Alice in Wonderland," who went about saying "off with his head" to every difficulty that confronted her. They are going to the House of Lords saying "Off with his head," and that is all they have to say regarding the problem which faces them, and a grave problem we know it is.<lb/>
I want to say a word upon what I believe to be the real necessity for reforming this House&#x2014;the defects which are supposed to exist in this House. I do not wish to set out my own imagination, but the
<col>270</col>
opinion of one outside. There is an article this month in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, which lays down, I think very clearly, what is supposed to be the view of the outside public, on what the writer evidently supposes are the faults of this House. One obvious blot in the position of this House is said to be the indiscriminate application of heredity. That is the very proposition which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has laid before your Lordships, but I must make one remark with regard to it. I am entirely in favour of some change in that respect. I should not like it to go to the country that we believe in the existence of certain members of this House whom I will call "undesirables." I do not mean to use this word in the least offensively; I use the word for shortness. But I should like further to say I can conceive many reasons which a member of this House may have for not attending which are positively worthy and admirable. A man's private affairs may be such as to make him think quite properly that he is the only man who can direct them, and he may think it more important that he should be in attendance upon his own affairs than that he should be one of a large body of this kind. As I say, I do not use the word "undesirables" in an offensive sense. But he is a man who is, as far as Legislation is concerned, undesirable because he cannot attend to it. Can any noble Lord give me two instances in which the votes of what I call the "undesirables" have ever determined one of your Lordships' decisions? I do remember one. It was on the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, not, of course, the last time it was in the House, because it was passed then by the deliberate intention of the regular attendants of this House. But I speak of former years. I remember one occasion when the Second Reading was passed by, I think, ten votes, when I did see a great number of persons in the House whom I had never seen before. But even then it did not secure the passing of the measure, and for this reason, that there is no staying power in these "undesirables." You cannot get them up the second time. You can whip them up on one occasion, but you can never get them twice, and ever since I have had the honour of being a member of this House I do not remember any decision of your Lordships being carried by the votes of the "undesirables." All those decisions in which the "undesirables" have figured would have been
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0161"/>
<col>271</col>
the same if they had not been there. True, I think that this is enormously exaggerated.<lb/>
The second objection is as to political partizanship. We all regret that, but on a former occasion I had the honour of asking who it was who spoiled the proportions of this House. I can remember the time, as can many noble Lords, when this House was fairly equally divided, and when there was no complaint of a preponderance of Conservative votes. But the Party opposite adopted the most unstates-manlike act that had ever been perpetrated by a Party in the acceptance of Home Rule. They revolted the feeling of the whole country. They revolted the feeling of this House and this House showed that it accurately represented the feeling of the country by throwing out that Bill by a large majority. From that moment the balance of the House has changed. Why has it changed? Because, speaking with reference to a period of twenty or thirty years, the balance of the country has changed. There are those who talk as though the country were Radical. How many years in the last twenty has a Radical Government had a majority in this country? Why, they have not got one, except of a very adventitious kind, even now. They have not been able to keep their majority such as it was for four years! The real truth of the matter is that this Home Rule Bill has been a weight around the necks of the Radical Party ever since it was first proposed, and the whole feeling of the country has, in consequence, been on our side of the House. The preponderance of the House of Lords is really the deliberate preponderance&#x2014;not, I admit, the transient preponderance that we saw four years ago, but the deliberate preponderance&#x2014;of the feeling of the country. But, my Lords, alter it by all means. I wish very much that we could see some change in the proportion of the two Parties in this House. Let me say, however, that I cannot congratulate the Party opposite on their efforts to improve matters.<lb/>
There is another objection, and that is the enormous character of this House; the objection that we are too large a body. Well, the Government has added some thirty odd new Peers since it came into office. That is the Government's remedy for an overcrowded House. And those noble Lords are, I have no doubt, possessed
<col>272</col>
of all the talents and the experience which fit them to be members of this House. We have welcomed them gladly, but I cannot say that they have added much to the strength of their Party in debate. We have waited for the support which this large contingent was to have afforded the minority in this House. I am afraid, however, that the Government's efforts in making this addition of a large number of Peers have not been calculated to redress, even in a small degree, the disproportion which exists in the fighting power and the debating power of this House.<lb/>
There is one other charge that is made against this House, and that is its aloofness from public opinion. That, again, my Lords, I greatly doubt. I have already shown how in the case of the Home Rule Bill there was no aloofness from the opinion of the country on the part of this House. In these days members of Parliament very much more frequently than used to be the case have no connection whatever with the constituencies they represent. They are what are called in vulgar language "carpet-baggers," and I doubt whether these gentlemen do know very much about the feeling of the country. I doubt extremely whether they know very much about the feeling of their constituents, and, were it necessary, I think I could give reasons from my own experience for having that belief. I think your Lordships who live amongst your own people and have done so all your lives, who constantly mix with them, have a much better knowledge of their ideas and opinions than many of these "carpet-bagging" members of Parliament who profess their knowledge of the feelings of the people.<lb/>
I have only one other observation to make with regard to the defects of this House. There is one very gross defect in the eyes of the people, a defect which makes this House very unpopular in certain quarters. It is the fact that when the Law Lords sit in this House and adjudicate upon the most intricate legal questions they are referred to as "the House of Lords." I have been quite amazed at the belief held on this subject by the public. In regard to such questions as the Taff Vale dispute and the property of the Free Church in Scotland, questions of the greatest intricacy, it was the belief that we laymen, sitting in this House, had decided those very difficult and intricate questions. The sooner we
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0162"/>
<col>273</col>
disabuse the public mind of that the better. But we go back to where we started. These are defects which do not really touch the efficiency of this House. They are defects which touch it in one sense, no doubt. They touch it indirectly because they are supposed to affect the House and its ability to perform its functions very much more than they really do. By all means let us address ourselves in an intelligent manner to removing all misunderstandings between this House and the country. Let us remove every excuse&#x2014;and I believe it can easily be done&#x2014;for supposing that this House is not as fully able to perform its duties as we really know it to be. If that is done, I cannot help thinking that we shall strengthen the Constitution. I cannot help thinking that even some of those who sit on the opposite Benches, and who now, with a light heart, are supporting a Government which wishes to tear up the old Constitution of England and to destroy some of its main features, will be very grateful when they are saved from the intolerable tyranny which any single-Chamber system would impose upon them, and the intolerable tyranny of that which would most certainly follow, as it has always followed, on an unfettered democracy&#x2014;the strong personal tyranny of one individual man.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00691"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD STANMORE</member> had given notice to move, as an Amendment, to omit from the Motion the words "Second Chamber" ["so as to constitute a strong and efficient Second Chamber"] and to insert the words "Upper House of Parliament." The noble Lord said: My Lords, this Amendment is not proposed in any spirit of hostility to the Motion for going into Committee which has been moved by the noble Earl. On the contrary, so far from being moved in any spirit of hostility its object is to obtain for that Motion votes, which otherwise in many cases possibly, and in some cases certainly, would be given against it. Unless some such modification of language as that which I have proposed is adopted, there are those who would otherwise gladly vote for the Motion who will have to withhold their support. There are those who think, as I do, that the language of a formal Resolution of this House is a subject of the gravest importance, and that it should be couched in terms strictly and technically correct.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00692">There are, no doubt, some who will say that if the general sense of the Resolution is understood exact accuracy of nomenclature
<col>274</col>
is of no importance. From that opinion I beg leave to differ. It matters very little what others call us, but it matters a great deal what we, in a formal Resolution, call ourselves. In those days of unceasing hurry, constant movement, and perpetual platform talk, there is hardly time for men in public life seriously to think, still less is there time for them to read, and therefore I am not surprised that some noble Lords should have learned little from the lessons of the past. But the noble Earl who moved the Resolution is not one of these. As a diligent student of history, he is well aware how important a part words and names have played and must play whether rightly applied or misapplied, and how they have affected events in great crises. We have an instance before us just now of the way in which words which are inaccurate can, by process of usage, be generally adopted, and practically make the older and more correct designations mean what they do not mean. In the last few months we have heard a great deal about the Veto of the House of Lords, as if there was such a thing. There really is not anything of the kind; but, from repetition, it is becoming the fact that this word "Veto" is being used to signify the concurrent legislative power of the House of Lords, which is going to be utterly obscured under this inaccurate label. That is an illustration of what I mean as to the use of words which are inaccurate often being of importance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00693">The words which I propose to omit from the Resolution are distinctly inaccurate, ambiguous, and misleading. They are inaccurate in relation to the present position of the House of Lords. It is quite true that in common parlance, in ordinary familiar language, we talk of the House of Lords as a Second Chamber, In a broad, general sense so it is: but that term is not strictly or formally accurate. It is not the case that we are a Second Chamber only. This House has the same power of initiation as the other, and although no doubt, generally speaking, the measures we have to consider here have been first considered and passed by another body, that is by no means invariably the case. Every session numbers of Bills&#x2014;obscure, if you will, but most useful Bills&#x2014;are brought in first in this House. We read a second time a score of them a few days ago, and last year one of the most important Acts of the year&#x2014;the India Councils Act&#x2014;passed through this House before it went to the House of Com-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0163"/>
<col>275</col>
mons. It is not correct to describe this House as it now exists as a "Second Chamber," and, when you apply that term to the Chamber which you are proposing to constitute, it is ambiguous, and, I think, misleading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00694">The words of the Resolution are that we go into Committee to consider, among other things, the construction of an "efficient Second Chamber." In the ordinary plain sense those words mean that we are asked to constitute a Chamber which is to be a Second Chamber and a Second Chamber only&#x2014;a Chamber which will merely have the power of considering measures sent to it from another place; a Chamber which will have no active initiative of its own. That power of initiative I believe all your Lordships would be most unwilling to part with. Therefore I say that strictly and in technical language to speak of this House as a Second Chamber is inaccurate. In regard to formal Resolutions which, if passed, are placed on the records of this House, we ought to take care to confine ourselves to language which is strictly accurate and precise. Let me point out that if the words "Second Chamber" were placed in any formal Motion or document they would be so used for the first time. Therefore I venture to propose that instead of words which are unprecedented, inaccurate, ambiguous, and misleading, we should substitute words which are well known and have been formally authorised, viz., "the Upper House of Parliament." I cannot conceive why any one should have any objection to that change. We know from what the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has said that it is not his intention to propose anything like a Second Chamber which shall be a Second Chamber only. We know that his purpose is to propose a real and a strengthened Upper House of Parliament. Then why not use words which will conciliate those who, with the present wording, feel themselves, however reluctantly, unable to support the Motion. Depend upon it, if the House by a formal Resolution determines to consider the construction of a "Second Chamber." it will be pressed on us from without that we have of our own accord voluntarily surrendered all claim to initiate measures in Parliament.</p>

<col>278</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00714"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl on the Cross Benches who has placed the Motion on the Paper which we are engaged in discussing has, I think, rendered thereby a conspicuous service to this House and to the country. When he referred in his memorable speech two nights ago to those members of your Lordships' House who had interested themselves in this question in the past he modestly refrained from alluding to one Peer who for more than a quarter of a century has identified himself with this movement, and who more than any one else is responsible for the change in public feeling on the matter. I mean to himself. In good report and in evil report the noble Earl has adhered to the views which he first put before your Lordships, I believe in the year 1884, and for my own part I firmly hope that in the decision at which your Lordships' House may arrive the noble Earl may reap the reward of his foresight and convictions.<lb/>
I observe that it is a common thing to express regret that the advice of the noble Earl was not acted upon at an earlier date and that your Lordships did not proceed to consider the question of your own reform long years ago. That is a feeling which I do not altogether share. For great reforms an atmosphere of reform is wanted. You require some external stimulus, either in the pressure of public opinion or in the force of events. Great reforms, either in this country or in any other, have never come like thunder from a clear sky. It is only when there is a certain amount of electricity in the air, when there has been a prolonged, and perhaps profound, atmospheric disturbance that the minds of the people are attuned to the acceptance of great change. For my part I venture to think that this moment is not inopportune for the consideration of this question, but that it is, on the contrary, extremely favourable. We have recently had a General Election which turned very largely upon the subject of your Lordships' House. A great deal of popular and public interest has been excited on that question. Many noble Lords have been impelled thereby to devote to the subject more attention than perhaps they had previously given to it. If it be said that it is useless for a Party in opposition to consider the question of constitutional reform and that such a proceeding can only properly emanate from a responsible Government, I think the reply to that is that it is not impossible that these condi-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0165"/>
<col>279</col>
tions may be realised at no very distant date, that His Majesty's Government are themselves, by their policy, endeavouring to remove that disability from our shoulders, and that if your Lordships find it in your power, as I trust you may do, to arrive at any general agreement on the principles of this question, there is good reason to hope that that agreement may at no very remote period in the future become the basis for legislative action taken by a responsible Government seated on those Benches in this House.<lb/>
But, my Lords, although I have argued that the situation is a favourable one, and although the circumstances that I have described have brought it very rapidly to the front, I also agree with those noble Lords who have contended in debate that it is unnecessary and that it would be unwise for us to proceed with any desperate or unreasoning haste. It is unwise because, in the first place, it might suggest that we were inspired by a feeling of panic, which I am sure is not at all the case; and, secondly, because no sensible man, to whatever Party he may belong, would imagine for a moment that such a question as the reform and reconstitution of one of the branches of the Legislature of the oldest and most famous country in the world can possibly be concerted in a debate of either a few days, a few weeks, or even a few months.<lb/>
We have heard a great deal in this discussion about the sifting and winnowing that will have to take place in order to eliminate the superfluous members of your Lordships' House. That we all acknowledge to be in itself a very delicate and very difficult task; but I think a not less delicate and difficult task will be the sifting and winnowing of all the various plans for the reform of your Lordships' House, with some of which we have been made acquainted and which probably nearly every noble Lord who sits on this side of the House has in his pocket, but which I think for the most part we shall do well if we put on one side on the occasion of this debate. After all, what we have to do here is to put our several ideas for what they may be worth into the common stock, not to attach ourselves too closely to any individual scheme to which we may have given publicity in the past or which we may favour now, but to arrive if we can at a general agreement on the broad principles of reform which, if they are accepted, may later on provide the basis of a concrete plan. That I understand to be the object of the noble
<col>280</col>
Earl on the Cross Benches in putting his Motion on the Paper, and in that object I believe he has the support of the great majority of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
My Lords, there is another criticism to which I should like to demur. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, in his speech the other evening taunted us, very amiably as is his wont, with the transformation scene that had taken place between our attitude in November last and our position to-day, and he implied&#x2014;I think he directly charged&#x2014;that because the great majority of your Lordships' House thought that you were competent to reject the Budget last November and to refer it to the people, and because a good many of us defended that action of your Lordships on platforms throughout the country, therefore we regarded, or regard, the constitution of this House as above reproach, as beyond amendment, and that there has been some change of attitude, some inconsistency, a sort of deathbed repentance on our part in now coming forward and advocating measures of reform. My Lords, I do not think that that taunt can fairly be applied to the great majority of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House. There are a good many of us to whom it cannot possibly apply, and in whose cases it leaves our withers entirely unwrung.<lb/>
For many years, I should say for the last twenty or thirty years, there has been a strong and stalwart body in the rank and file of the Unionist Party, both in this House and in the other House of Parliament, who have been steady and sincere advocates of the reform of this Chamber and who have not changed their opinions one iota in anything that we may say in the course of this debate. The noble Viscount will, I am sure, remember that in the old days when I had the honour of being a member of the House of Commons with him, every year there used to appear on the Paper of the House of Commons a Motion in the name of that agreeable and innocuous Vandal, Mr. Labouchere, in favour of the abolition sometimes of the hereditary principle and sometimes of the House of Lords. I do not think that anybody took it very seriously, least of all the author himself. But in looking up the debates on those occasions I find that in 1888, 1889, and 1890 I was myself responsible for putting an Amendment on the Paper of the House of Commons in favour
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0166"/>
<col>281</col>
of the reform and modification of the hereditary principle. On one occasion I had the honour of being followed in debate by the noble Viscount opposite, who chaffed me not upon the adequacy or inadequacy of our schemes for reform, but only, and with perfect justice, on the rather slow paces that were at that time taken by our leaders.<lb/>
About the same time the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, who is now seated here, and I co-operated, I remember, and we had the audacity to put forward in the pages of a magazine proposals in which the idea of service as a test for the admission of hereditary Peers to this House was, I think for the first time, elaborated on a considerable scale. We proposed a House of Lords with 300 members&#x2014;I think that total is rather favoured by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches&#x2014;with a proportion of fifty elected from outside. What is of more moment, some noble Lords may remember that at the same time we sent a round-robin to the late Lord Salisbury which was known as "the wail of the eldest sons." It was signed by twenty-three eldest sons of Peers who were at that time in the House of Commons and of whom as many as seventeen now have the honour of being members of your Lordships' House. If for no other reason, respectability was attached to our pronouncement by the fact that the first signature to it was that of the late Duke of Devonshire, then Lord Hartington, and of the twenty-three as many as eleven signed a declaration in favour of a modification of the hereditary principle. I do not mention these excursions of our salad days in the smallest degree with the idea of advertising our old programme or of extolling our own prescience. I merely mention them in order to show that on the part of a great many of us there has been none of that tardy conversion to which the noble Viscount opposite referred.<lb/>
There is one regret which, as an old advocate of this change, I should like most sincerely to confess, and that is that neither now, nor then, nor at any time of which I am cognisant, have we received any support whatever in these ideas and views from the members of the Party opposite. I listened the other night with all respect to the speech of the noble Viscount. There was not in that speech, which was the official utterance from that
<col>282</col>
Bench, any hint of any sympathy with reform of the House of Lords. What concerned the noble Viscount opposite was the relations of the two Houses and the institution of steps which would secure the subordination of this House to the House of Commons. And even in that argument I think there was some contradiction. Your Lordships will remember that at one moment of his speech the noble Viscount was found to argue that in reality we had single-Chamber Government in this country&#x2014;in other words, that this House is a weak and negligible factor&#x2014;and almost in the same breath he was found contending that the so-called Veto of your Lordships' House is a dangerous and unconstitutional weapon which ought to be taken away.<lb/>
Both in the speeches to which we have listened from the Government during the last few months and all the way through this agitation, if agitation it has been, there has not been the slightest recognition on the part of the opposite Party that there is any national and Imperial side to this question, that it is not the victory of one Party over another, either us here or you there, that the country desires, but that the great majority of the thinking men in the country, the very men whom the noble Viscount rather unfairly disparaged the other evening, are saying all this time "A plague on both your Houses. Why don't you get to work and put an end to all these excursions and alarums, clear away the weaknesses and blemishes which everybody admits exist in your Upper Chamber, and give us something like stability and peace in our Constitution in the future?" I venture to say that that demand is becoming more articulate and more audible every day in the country, and yet, when we look to the reply that is made from the Ministry, they are perfectly dumb.<lb/>
Two nights ago, Sir Edward Grey made a speech somewhere in London, and in that speech, which was partly devoted to the subject of your Lordships' House, he argued that a Government which had obtained only a majority of something like thirty in its first Division in the House of Commons, was not strong enough to reform the House of Lords. Good heavens! Is it strong enough, then to destroy it? What an admission! Their numbers are not sufficient to execute the necessary repairs in the fabric of the Constitution of the State, but they are
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0167"/>
<col>283</col>
sufficient to take the axe and crow-bar and batter it to the ground. On the first night of the session we had an equally disheartening reply from the noble Earl who leads the Government in this House. In his view, the counsels of what I should describe as of prudence and common sense cannot prevail because, he told us, the two Houses are to be regarded as in a state of war. I venture to say that that is a purely artificial and concocted belligerence, and I am sure there is no less willing participator in the fray than the noble Earl himself.<lb/>
I think we may, in this respect, derive a lesson from other nations much more excitable than our own. I was reading in the papers only a day or two ago an account of a duel that had taken place in Italy. An excitable Italian Deputy had insulted, or was thought to have insulted, a General in the Parliament there. A duel ensued between the two. There was a most desperate encounter and the Deputy wounded the General in the cheek. What happened? When this climax had been reached did they separate in grumbling solitude and say that a state of war existed between them in the future? Not a bit. They met on the scene of combat, they shook hands, and with the emotionalism of southern people they actually embraced. I am not suggesting that we should indulge in any such transports as that. I am not prepared myself to embrace the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I am still more convinced that he is not prepared to embrace me. But for the two great Parties in the State, after this historic encounter in which everybody admits that neither side has gained a substantial victory, and in which, therefore, there ought to be no sense of humiliation on either side, when they come back again to stand on their dignity, or for one of them, at any rate, to stand on its dignity, and refuse to consider the welfare of the institutions in which they are jointly interested, does seem to me a melancholy illustration of the frailty of human nature and the faults of the Party system.<lb/>
I will, if your Lordships will permit me, draw a more pregnant illustration still from quarters that are, perhaps, of greater interest to ourselves. A year ago I was in South Africa, and there I saw, not merely the leaders of two parties, but the captains of two armies, the champions of two races, who, a few years before, had been engaged in a bloody and devastating war, laying
<col>284</col>
aside all animosities, burying their ancient tales of wrong, and co-operating together in order to create a new Constitution for their country. My Lords, if Boer and Briton can do that in South Africa, why cannot Liberal and Conservative do it here? The task there was much more delicate and complex than anything that confronts us here. They had to bind up the wounds of the battlefield. We merely have to heal the contusions of the platform. They were engaged in building up a new Constitution. All that we have to do is to patch up an old one. They were engaged in creating a new nation. What we want to do is to preserve all that is best in one of the oldest and most famous nations of the world.<lb/>
But I suppose it is no good talking like this. We are officially told that we are officially at war with each other and, therefore, instead of co-operating together, as sensible men ought to do, we are reduced to this impotent strife which can only result in detriment to the country and injury to both the Parties in it. The Government are the best judges of their own conduct, and I dare say it is an impertinence on my part to venture to criticise them as I have done. I think myself they are mistaken. I think that history will not lightly exonerate the heads of a great Party, sponsors and creators of this House just as much as we may be, if in a fit of petulance or simulated resentment they stand aside while the fate of this House is being discussed and affect a scornful indifference to proposals that are being put forward for its improvement. However that may be, our path, I think, is clear. I hope we shall not let slip the opportunity, the great and golden opportunity, as I regard it, that has been presented to us, and I trust that in these proceedings the majority of your Lordships' House will sincerely, honestly, definitely, and finally commit yourselves to the broad principles of a serious and acceptable scheme of reform of this Chamber.<lb/>
There are many of us in this House who took part in the recent General Election which, as I have said, turned largely on the question of the House of Lords. I think we did so with much advantage and pleasure to ourselves, and not altogether without satisfaction to the people. Anyhow, the House of Commons appears to have been so much impressed with, if not the popularity, at any rate the propriety of our proceedings that their first act at the commencement of the session was to extend the period of our
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0168"/>
<col>285</col>
activity in the future right up to the day of the polls. I own I am aghast at the vistas of rhetorical activity that this seems to open up before us, and which, I observe, struck a chill into the intrepid bosom of my noble friend Lord Newton, though I think that was a simulated indignation on his part&#x2014;[Lord NEWTON: Not a bit.]&#x2014;because I believe he occupied almost every night between the rejection of the Budget by this House and the issue of the writs in making admirable and convincing speeches in the country which were largely responsible for the result that was attained. Whether that does or does not add to our burdens in the future, I think it is a good thing for your Lordships' House, because it will help to put an end to the childish nonsense that we hear talked about the alleged difference between the Peers and the people, the sham distinction between the classes and the masses. If your Lordships appear, as I hope you will continue to do, in the future, on the platform in the stress of a General Election those preposterous ideas cannot continue to prevail, and I believe the time will come when that unthinking act of the House of Commons the other day will be regarded as a striking incident in the history of the British aristocracy, and as having started them on a career of fresh contact and of fresh influence with the people.<lb/>
What was our experience at the General Election in relation to the House of Lords? Each man can, of course, only speak from his own experience, which is necessarily limited, but I think most noble Lords on this side will agree with what I am about to say. In the first place, we found the keenest interest to hear the question of the House of Lords discussed, and a perfectly good-humoured and truly British desire to hear the case of the Peers stated by a Peer himself. Secondly&#x2014;and here, of course, I can only speak from my own experience&#x2014;there did not appear to be any resentment at our action in referring the Budget to the people. On the contrary, the people showed by their votes that we had correctly gauged their views, because, as we all know, they have returned to Parliament a majority believed to be hostile to that measure. Thirdly, I would say this, that the country showed itself absolutely resolved to have a Second Chamber of some sort. I do not deny that there may be a section or sections of the community who, because they are interested in some particular object in the way of
<col>286</col>
which stands your Lordships' House, may be opposed to the existence of any Second Chamber in this country. That is true of the Socialist Party; to some extent it is true of the Labour Party; and I believe, for the time being, at all events, of the whole of the Irish Party. But obviously these are the interested and selfish views of fractions, I might almost say factions, of the community; they are not the views of the country as a whole. I doubt if any of your Lordships will deny the proposition that this country, democratic as it is, is not prepared to entrust its destinies to the unfettered control of a representative Chamber, even though that Chamber be elected by itself.<lb/>
If the country desires a Second Chamber, is it not clear also, from all our experience, that it desires a Second Chamber that shall be reasonably efficient and strong&#x2014;not so strong as to override and overawe the House of Commons, but strong enough to be courageous and independent&#x2014;the precise virtues that have more than once been claimed for your Lordships' House in the course of this debate&#x2014;able to discharge with efficiency its functions as a revising and suspensory Chamber, and sufficiently representative to represent in this House those sides of the national character, those aspects of public feeling, and those departments of public activity which are not, and from the nature of the case cannot be, properly represented in the House of Commons? I believe that that is a fairly correct statement of the views of the country on this subject.<lb/>
Then I would say this&#x2014;and here, again, I think I shall be endorsed by noble Lords behind me&#x2014;that during the election there was no subject more certain to evoke cheers than the advocacy of the reform of the House of Lords; and at the same time there was no subject which excited less enthusiasm than the proposals of His Majesty's Government. I believe that Lord Marchamley, whom I see in his place and whose recent pronouncement was quoted on Monday by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, correctly represented the views of the great majority of the Party whom he recently shepherded into the Liberal fold when he denounced the Campbell Bannerman proposal to which we understand the Government have pinned their faith. I can only say that I never met a Liberal who, in the frankness of personal intercourse, did not regard that particular
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0169"/>
<col>287</col>
proposal for the destruction of the Veto and the emasculation of the House of Lords as otherwise than illogical and absurd. Surely there is something intensely grotesque in denouncing as a House of hereditary incompetents your Lordships' House, and then leaving it to exist still as a Second Chamber, still as a House of Lords, in order that you may pour your recruits into its disabled and discredited ranks. Is there not also something eminently unjust in the attempt to deprive your Lordships of the greater part of your constitutional and legal rights, and to leave you to sit in this Chamber with your privileges gone and only your disabilities left? And I would say, too, that there is something almost shabby and mean in the attempt to use a passing Parliamentary majority in order permanently to stereotype the superiority of one Party in the State. For these reasons I believe the particular proposals which represent the policy of the Government have not the smallest chance, whatever may be their immediate future, of being permanently incorporated in the Constitution of this country. I am surprised, though I cannot profess to be sorry, that the Government have pinned their allegiance to proposals which seem to us at all events to be so illogical, so indefensible, and so manifestly unfair.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I doubt very much from what I saw whether the country entertains any real objection to the exercise by your Lordships' House of your constitutional rights&#x2014;be they legal or constitutional, I do not dispute that point&#x2014;with regard to Finance Bills, Money Bills, and Supply. I have no doubt they would object to the wanton and frequent and unscrupulous use of those rights; but the whole case of noble Lords opposite is that our action was a single and unprecedented one, so that that argument cannot apply. So far as I can judge, the electorate saw and see no reason why the Second Chamber of this country should not enjoy the same privileges as regards the treatment of finance which are possessed, for instance, by the Senates of the most democratic countries in the world, the United States of America and France, which are enjoyed by the Second Chambers which we have given to our most important Colonies, and which indeed form part of the Constitution of every considerable State in the civilised world.<lb/>
<col>288</col>
I believe that the particular cry that we are upsetting the balance of the Constitution, which we first heard from the Woolsack, is one which has not aroused any general response in the country, and that it would have needed even more than the persuasive eloquence of the noble and learned Lord himself to convince a public meeting of the proposition that he placed before your Lordships' House in November last. But even if this be true, there remain certain faults and blemishes in your Lordships' House as to which the country is, I think, convinced, and as to which it does desire amendment. The first of these can be dismissed in a couple of sentences because there is almost universal agreement on the matter. It is that this House is needlessly large. You are indeed the largest Senate in point of numbers in the world. And there are a considerable number of your members who might be relieved of their legislative duties without considerable sacrifice to themselves and without detriment to the State.<lb/>
The second feeling in the country is a feeling of regret that no machinery has ever been devised by which the Liberal Party when it is in a great majority, as it is now, as it has recently been, and as it may be again, in the House of Commons, can obtain an adequate reflection of its predominance in this House. My Lords, may I say in all sincerity that we on this side regret that just as much as you do. We regret the spectacle which we often see of the rather naked condition of the benches opposite. We know very well that it gives an air of one-sidedness and of unreality to our proceedings. We sympathised with the noble Earl the leader of the House, when, in a speech which he delivered some time ago he complained of the feeling of depression which settled down upon his own spirit because of the surroundings in which he found himself, and we know that the disparity between the two sides paralyses and sterilises our debates. There is not one of us who does not welcome the plentiful infusion of new blood to those benches, and we rejoice that the stream continues to pour in with undiminished force. But as we see the incoming current gradually changing its hue and assimilating itself to the larger stream which it joins, although we may express no surprise I can assure your Lordships that we feel great regret at the result. I believe that if any scheme could be devised&#x2014;and I
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0170"/>
<col>289</col>
think such a scheme is a necessary part of any measure of reform&#x2014;by which the Liberal Party could be assured of a more permanent representation in this House, it would meet with a most ready acceptance from those who sit on this side.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there is the well-known and admitted objection to the mainly hereditary composition of your Lordships' House. I say mainly because I think that the extent of the hereditary basis of this House is apt to be somewhat exaggerated, and that the public hardly realise the fact that as much as one-fourth of this House is not constituted upon an hereditary basis at all. There are the twenty-six Bishops, who represent their sees, and who may be said to come here on the ground of personal service; there are the six Law Lords, there are the sixteen Scottish and the twenty-eight Irish Peers who, although they are elected out of the hereditary Peerage, yet come here not as hereditary Peers, but by right of election. Finally, there are no fewer than eighty members of your Lordships' House who have been sent here for the first time in their own persons by recent Ministries, both Conservative and Liberal, who may beget hereditary Peers in the next generation, but who are not hereditary Peers themselves and who, in many cases, having no heirs and no families, are more like Life Peers than anything else. If you add all these together you have no fewer than 150 members of your Lordships' House who are not here by virtue of hereditary right at all. I am in agreement with the general propositions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, but I think, if he will allow me to say so, that he rather overstated his case against the hereditary principle both in the estimation in which it is held in the country and in its effect on the policy of the State.<lb/>
Now, I have some figures here which I should like to give to the House. I suppose that if the argument about the absurdity of the hereditary principle were sound the last person whom a popular electorate ought to return to Parliament would be the eldest son of a Peer. If a man is absurd as a legislator in this House when his father is dead, he ought to be equally absurd as a legislator in the other House while his father is still alive. Now, in the recent election the number of eldest sons who stood for the House of Commons was thirty-six, and of these no fewer than twenty-four were returned to the House of Commons, twenty-two of
<col>290</col>
them representing the Party who are described as the hereditary foes of the people. The number of younger sons of Peers standing for the House of Commons was forty, of whom twenty-three were successfully returned&#x2014;a rather less proportion, so that the country, if any inference is to be drawn from proportion, rather preferred the elder sons to the younger sons, thereby giving the seal of their approbation to this most vicious principle. Then the country actually had the chance of returning Peers to the House of Commons for there were three Irish Peers who stood for popular constituencies. Two of these, drawn from the Party to which I belong, were elected, and the third drawn from the Party opposite was rejected. Finally, the number of seats that were won from the Radicals by eldest sons of Peers was nine, and the number gained by the younger sons of Peers was seven. Those figures&#x2014;which I give for what they are worth; I do not want to push them too far&#x2014;indicate a somewhat different aspect of the attitude of the electorate towards the hereditary principle from that which finds currency in a great many speeches that we hear.<lb/>
I should like now to consider the operation of the hereditary principle in our Constitution. I put aside for the moment the question of antiquity, although I think in an ancient country like ours that is by no means to be disregarded. I put aside also, the unchallenged application of the principle of heredity in the case of the Throne. I say only that I think a very good case can be made out for the hereditary principle on the ground of proven utility in the service of the State. I think it would be absurd to say that the hereditary principle justifies the House of Lords, but I think it might not unfairly be contended that the House of Lords has justified the hereditary principle. It has given the country a House of Lords which, at any rate, over the broad field of its history, has seldom been wanting in wisdom and courage. It has given to this country an upper class which, on the whole, has honourably and fairly trained itself in the responsibilities of government. It has saved this country from the danger of a plutocracy or an upper class of professional politicians. It has given us a Second Chamber which has been strong enough to resist the clamour of popular passion, but not strong enough to offer permanent obstruction to necessary change. I think all these claims can fairly be made for the hereditary
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0171"/>
<col>291</col>
principle. I do not wish to push them too far; but I think they justify our desire to retain for the hereditary element a fair share, I will not say a preponderating share, in the future composition of a reformed House of Lords.<lb/>
I admit that were we now constructing a Second Chamber we should not dream of basing it on the hereditary principle. I quite admit that the principle is open to attack, criticism, misrepresentation, and abuse, which weaken its force and give it an insufficient hold upon the confidence of the people. I would go further and say that to some extent it is an historical anachronism. In the past, when the great landowners represented the chief force of the State&#x2014;a force so strong that it could stand up successfully against the King&#x2014;it was a natural thing that the hereditary principle should be the basis for the Second Chamber. Now other interests have come to the front, the balance of society has been changed, and that which might have been desirable and proper as the sole basis of a Second Chamber two or three hundred years ago has ceased to have the same efficacy and justification. For these reasons I agree that the hereditary principle ought no longer to be the main basis of the constitution of a reformed House of Lords; but I hope very much that the hereditary principle will not be banished from its association with this House. I am sure nothing is further from the intentions of Lord Rosebery than to suggest anything of the sort. [The Earl of ROSEBEEY: Hear, hear.] I am sure he would agree with me in holding that it is desirable, in any scheme of reform, that the hereditary Peers should retain, either by process of election or selection, or subject to such tests as the wisdom of the House may decide, a considerable, although not necessarily a preponderant share in the composition of this House.<lb/>
There is another reason why we should not depart too hastily from precedent in this matter or bring about too violent a rupture with the past. We are rather apt to talk in this country as if the only persons interested in the House of Lords were the electors of the United Kingdom. But there is such a thing as the British Empire. The proceedings of your Lordships' House are studied probably quite as closely&#x2014;I dare say more closely&#x2014;across the seas than they are in this country; and the point of view from which this House, and, indeed, both Houses, are
<col>292</col>
regarded in our Dominions is not less important than the point of view from which they are regarded at home. Remember this. The members of the House of Commons are elected exclusively by the voters of England. Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and are chosen, almost exclusively, on domestic grounds; and yet these members are charged with the government of the whole British Empire.<lb/>
You may ask&#x2014;How is it that this astonishing constitutional anomaly has survived through all these years? It is due to two facts. In the first place, to the fact that the Colonies themselves have year by year acquired an increasing measure of self-government, which has enabled them to override the mistakes and to snap their fingers at the sometimes injudicious interference of the House of Commons; and, secondly, to the fact that the Colonies have always looked to this House as containing a truer perception of Imperial and Colonial feeling than the House across the way; as a place where their case is stated with experience, is regarded with sympathy, and is judged with authority. As one who has served the Empire in foreign parts I cannot exaggerate the importance of this consideration. It is quite a mistake to suppose that, because the Colonies are Liberal or democratic in sentiment, therefore they have an inherent dislike to an aristocratic Second Chamber. What they want in a Second Chamber is character, authority, and experience. If they found that a Second Chamber composed exclusively of Dukes was more infected with the Imperial spirit and viewed their standpoint with greater sympathy, they would vote for a Second Chamber of Dukes. Anyhow I am quite certain they would sooner have a Second Chamber of Dukes than a First Chamber of demagogues.<lb/>
If these considerations apply to great democratic communities like the Colonies, how much more do they operate in the case of an ancient and aristocratic continent like that of India. If you ask the potentates of Asia or the Princes of India to which House of His Majesty's Parliament they look with greater respect and greater sympathy, I very much doubt whether they will reply the House that sits across the way. The House of Lords is regarded throughout India with enormous veneration and respect. This is largely due to the fact that the composition of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0172"/>
<col>293</col>
this House rests on a basis which is familiar in every stratum of Indian society; and I beg of you to be very careful that in your scheme for reforming this House you do not destroy that respect, that veneration which is essential not merely to your Constitution but to the maintenance of your Empire. You cannot afford in the pursuit of any merely Party interest to ignore the point of view of the Empire, and it is impossible for any Party to remodel the Constitution in order to satisfy its domestic interests at home without any regard to the impression that may be produced in those wider areas across the seas.<lb/>
I have been defending the retention of some share of the hereditary Peerage in the future composition of this House. We are then confronted with the difficulty of how to fill up the remainder. My noble friend Lord Salisbury made a most able and powerful plea yesterday for the principle of Peerages nominated by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister. I would gladly see a number of such Peerages to be filled at the rate of so many a year for a term of years, placed at the disposal of the Prime Minister of the day, because it would enable him to fill up the gap on the opposite benches which I have already deplored. But I hope that in considering the question of replenishing this House from outside you will not lightly dismiss the idea which was favoured by Lord Rosebery of election for a portion at any rate of your Lordships' House. For a purely elective Second Chamber I have no sympathy whatever. I hope your Lordships will have nothing to do with it. We do not want two Parliamentary Kings of Brentford in this country. We feel that it is almost impossible to imagine an elective Second Chamber which will not steal away some of the prestige and authority of the House of Commons, or which will not land us in periods of recurrent constitutional strife. But though election may be, in the opinion of many of us, the worst of all suggestions as the exclusive basis for a Second Chamber, I yet hold, and I think that many of your Lordships will agree with me, that it is worthy of consideration as a basis for a portion of a reformed House of Lords.<lb/>
I argue this question on the widest grounds of expediency and public interest. What do we want to secure in reforming
<col>294</col>
the House of Lords? In the main, I take it, we desire to broaden the basis of this House in public esteem, and to bring it into closer contact than it is in now with the life, the aspirations, and the needs of the democracy at large. A freer use of nomination, as recommended by Lord Salisbury, may, as I have said, enable a Radical Minister to put more Radical Peers on those Benches. But will it attach the democracy to the House of Lords, or make the House stronger in the support and esteem of the people? It is not our business at this stage to work out a plan. The noble Earl who opened this debate deliberately refrained from doing so. I should be most averse myself from direct election to this House by popular constituencies. But the noble Earl indicated a scheme which is well worthy of serious consideration. He indicated that it might be possible to group the county councils and the county borough councils, and that they might choose, let us say, a committee out of their number, which might elect or return a Peer to this House. That might be done on a certain scale of population. We may imagine that with a population of 42,000,000, which, I believe, is that of the United Kingdom at the present time, and with a Peer from every 500,000 of the people, you might in that way return eighty-four Peers to this House. That, at any rate, is a feasible plan.<lb/>
I do not wish, however, to say anything more about plans now, because really plans must come at a later stage. We shall then be at liberty to discuss and to analyse them. All that I have ventured to contend is that the arguments against election are not so powerful as to rule that principle out of your Lordships' consideration. For my own part, the essence of all reform is that we should endeavour to render your Lordships' House more popular&#x2014;I do not mean more popular in the narrow application of the term, as enabling it to catch votes at an election, but more popular in the sense of being more deeply rooted in the confidence and esteem and support of that which is, after all, the source of all political momentum, all strength, all power in this country&#x2014;namely, the democracy itself.<lb/>
The noble Earl concluded his speech two nights ago by an appeal to your Lordships to rise to the level of the occasion and, by voluntary sacrifice of some, at any rate, of your privileges, to lay the founda-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0173"/>
<col>295</col>
tions of an enduring Constitution in this country. I venture to think that that appeal will not fall on unwilling ears. In the long and glorious history of this House your Lordships have shown no reluctance to surrender any of your prerogatives which were open to misrepresentation or abuse. In 1868 you abolished the right to vote by proxy; in 1881 you disabled the bankrupt Peer from sitting and voting in this House; in 1876 you instituted a Life Peerage; in 1888 Lord Salisbury, the most powerful Prime Minister of recent times, proposed a scheme for a wide extension of that principle. In 1907 you appointed a Committee to consider your future constitution, and in 1908 that Committee both as its first act and its last act passed by a unanimous vote the important principle which figures as the third Resolution on the Paper. These are, I think, indications of a sincere desire to subordinate private interests to the public good, and of your willingness to surrender any of your privileges which can no longer be properly defended or beneficially maintained.<lb/>
But there is, after all, another side of the question. It is, I think, rather too hastily assumed that your Lordships are being asked to give up a great deal, and that you are going to get nothing whatever in return. That is not at all my view of the case. I believe your Lordships would gain at least as much as you would lose. Let me put the point. Take the case of a British Peer. The British Peer at present is compelled to be a member of your Lordships' House, whether he wishes or not. He cannot stand for the House of Commons; if he is a member of the House of Commons and succeeds to a Peerage, he is turned out of that House, and he cannot resign his membership here. Take the case of an Irish Peer. If an Irish Peer is not elected a representative Peer, it is true that he can stand for Parliament, but he cannot stand for a constituency in Ireland, where he is best known and for which he would most likely wish to sit. He has to come and find a constituency in this country. And if he is not elected for the House of Commons here, or if he does not wish to stand for the House of Commons here, and if at the same time he does not succeed in being elected as a representative Peer, he is excluded from Parliamentary life altogether. There are sixty Irish Peers at present in that position. Then take the case of a Scottish Peer. He is in the worst position of all.
<col>296</col>
A Scottish representative Peer is only elected for a Parliament. He may lose his seat. He has done so. He may fail to get elected at all. In that case he cannot even go to an English constituency; he is allowed to stand for nowhere. He is a sort of pariah dog in the Constitution and cannot anywhere find a Parliamentary kennel in which to lay his head.<lb/>
Well, all these disabilities which I have described, whether they apply to the British Peerage, the Scottish Peerage, or the Irish Peerage, must inevitably be swept away in any scheme of reform. All those disabilities will be removed in return for the sacrifice that your Lordships are requested to make. But then what will happen to a Peer in the future? A Peer may hope for election or for selection as one of the representatives of the hereditary Peerage in this House. If he fails in that object he might have the honour to become a Peer nominated upon the advice of the Prime Minister by the Crown. Or, in the third place, he might stand as a Peer for one of those larger constituencies, and might come up to this House as the Peer, for instance, for the City of London, or Lancashire or Yorkshire. Or, if all those avenues are shut to him, and he still desires to enter public life, there will remain entrance to the House of Commons. I hope I have demonstrated that if a good deal is taken away a good deal also may conceivably be added, and my own opinion is that, if your Lordships are willing to accept these sacrifices, what you surrender with one hand you will win back with the other. And if your attitude is favourable towards these counsels of reform you will place this House on a new foundation, which will not merely enable it to resist the shocks of Party strife in the future, and drive down fresh and living roots in the support of the people, but will give to the order to which you belong new and wider fields of activity, and will increase your popularity and your influence in the country at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00715"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: I feel that I am at some disadvantage in following in debate so acknowledged a master of oratory as the noble Lord who has just sat down. I welcomed from the bottom of my heart the first words in the opening part of the speech to which we have just listened. The noble Lord invited your Lordships to join with him in an investigation with regard to a reconstruction of this House on the principles of the Resolutions which are before us,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0174"/>
<col>297</col>
and he also asked us to throw our ideas into the common stock, so that we might together, on a non-Party basis I should imagine, help each other in the benevolent work of bringing about a reconstruction and reform of this House on a broader basis. But only a very short time passed before the noble Lord, driven, no doubt, by the fire of his own eloquence, proceeded to discuss, not the Resolutions which are before the House, but statistics of the General Election, matters concerned with the Budget, Chancellors of the Exchequer, and other inflammable matters of that sort; and shortly afterwards the noble Lord proceeded to criticise my noble friends who sit behind me with regard to propositions which we well know have not yet been placed on the Table of this House, and which we shall be able to meet in debate when they are put forward. I do not propose to follow the noble Lord in that polemical course, and I regret that he himself departed for a time from the original intentions which he had marked out in his speech.<lb/>
My noble friend on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery, not in the memorable speech with which he delighted this House and the country on Monday last but on a previous occasion, told us that your Lordships' House was the one assembly where a man might speak his independent thoughts and be listened to with patience and even with sympathy by his opponents. My Lords, I believe that never before, in my time, at any rate, has there been an occasion on which independent thought and unbiassed opinions were more necessary than now, for we are surely discussing a subject the inevitable outcome of which will touch the very foundations of our Constitution. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India told us the other night, very appositely, that the propositions of the Government were not before us. He meant, I presume, that we have not before us the results of the final and definite determination of a united Cabinet. That is undoubtedly a disadvantage in discussing these measures. On the other hand, in my humble opinion at any rate, it is not without advantage to the orthodox followers of my noble friend, because it places them in discussing this subject in a position of greater freedom and less responsibility, and it enables them to put forward their objections, if objections they have, to any possible scheme before it is finally announced and definitely laid before this House and the country. And surely that is
<col>298</col>
also an advantage because it enables objections, if objections should exist, to be answered, and the dissentients, if dissentients there be, to be satisfied, and in that way the unity of the Party&#x2014;if Party unity is in any way threatened&#x2014;would undoubtedly be maintained.<lb/>
But whatever ultimately may be our opinions on the Government scheme which is not now before us, of one thing I am well assured, speaking as a Liberal, and that is that to the propositions which have been laid before us by the noble Earl and which will be moved by the noble Earl when we go into Committee the most orthodox of Liberals can give his consent in the most unqualified manner. How often in the past, on platform after platform, have we not heard the hereditary principle as applied to the House of Lords denounced? I remember the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, my earliest teacher on this subject, borrowing a phrase of John Wesley's and applying it to the House of Lords. He told us that the time had come&#x2014;I think it was very nearly thirty years ago&#x2014;when this House must be either mended or ended. The reconstruction and remodelling of this House has over and over again during the past twenty years been advocated by Members on both sides; and we have heard speeches on this matter from some of the most distinguished leaders of the Liberal Party both inside and outside this House.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, said something about legislating in a panic. I do not for a moment say he said that; but I have seen it stated in some influentia journals that the position which is now taken up by this House is the result of a scare as to what is going to happen hereafter. I looked up the meaning of the word "scare." In the dictionary it is defined as "a momentary panic over some trifling cause." Well, my Lords, Lord Rosebery, Lord Onslow, and other noble Lords have been advocating this matter since 1884. How, then, can it be said that this action is being taken in a state of panic? If that state of things had obtained during those twenty-six years, I think the nervous systems and the bodily health of my noble friends would not have been so flourishing as I am happy to see they are to-day.<lb/>
The fact is, this question of reforming the House of Lords has been gradually ripening in the minds of the country, and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0175"/>
<col>299</col>
the time has come when we must offer a definite opinion and probably take a final decision on the subject. The propositions of my noble friend on the Cross Benches are simple, but they are far-reaching. They will form, as I believe, the bases of a measure which may be brought in at some future time. They may not be the only propositions which will emerge in the course of our debate, but the results of these propositions, if your Lordships accept them, will, I conclude, be the basis of decided action in the future. They would be laid before the country at the next General Election as propositions and Resolutions only, and if the country accepted them the Government returned would embody them in a Bill, and then that Bill would be laid before your Lordships' House and the other House of Parliament for consideration. All I can say is, if that be the destination of these Resolutions I for my part will give them my warmest support and approbation, and I cannot for the life of me think why they should not have the support of any orthodox Liberal.<lb/>
I should like to refer to a matter which, though not one of major importance, is yet worthy of consideration. I am presumptuous enough to take upon myself to mention this matter because it is an idea which has not been ventilated in your Lordships' House, and though it is well known in connection with other Senates I have never yet heard it proposed definitely for application to your Lordships' House. The question I refer to is, At what age should a hereditary Peer be qualified to take his seat as a Lord of Parliament? A Peer, as we all know, if he succeeds in his minority, takes his seat in this House at the age of twenty-one. That is not the case in many Senates. Take the Senate of France, for instance. That has been one of the most successful Senates which the world has ever seen, and it has fully justified its institution after the troubles of 1870. It has full powers of legislation; it has full powers over finance; it inaugurates legislation, and it embodies some of the most distinguished men of France who are proud to be members of it. What age has a Senator in France to be before he is fully qualified to take his place? Forty is the age fixed. It may be said, of course, that that is somewhat too advanced an age.<lb/>
Noble Lords will remember the cor-
<col>300</col>
respondence which appeared in the newspapers some years ago when it was contended by many that men were "too old at forty." That theory has somewhat disappeared, and it is a theory which could not be advanced in this House considering the notable examples we have to the contrary. My noble and learned friend the late Lord Chancellor, who is going to take part in this debate, is one of the most distinguished members of this House, but if I may say so without presumption, he could not possibly have been too old at forty. In fact, I go a little further and say that if he takes up a hostile position towards those who are advocating these Resolutions, they would find that besides "not being too old at forty," he was very much too young for them at eighty-five. I have ventured to state this proposition so that it might be considered whether the age of future Lords of Parliament might not be somewhat advanced. A Senate is surely not senile because it insists that its members should come to it with mature opinions and matured judgment. Nor could it be said that it is in its dotage because it demands as a qualification some experience and action in public affairs. It might be said, in opposition to this, that it would be a self-denying ordinance for our younger members. I say, on the contrary, it would be an advantage to our younger members, because it is obvious they would be in the position of elder sons. They would succeed as Lords of Parliament at thirty-five or forty instead of at twenty-one, and during that period they would be in a position, if they could get a constituency to elect them, to sit in the House of Commons. I think that some of the most illustrious members of this Assembly would have been glad if they had had an opportunity of serving during the years between twenty-one and thirty-five in the House of Commons, and obtaining that closer touch with the people of this country which membership of the House of Commons so often brings about.<lb/>
I was very sorry yesterday to hear noble Lords opposite for whose opinions I have the greatest respect say that the House of Commons had become degenerated, and they dwelt upon the degeneracy which in their opinion existed. The House of Commons, like any other body may do foolish things. It may produce foolish members. That is regrettable, but at the same time it is transient. Although I am a profound believer in a Second Chamber
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0176"/>
<col>301</col>
as an absolute necessity in constitutional government, I am a House of Commons man to the tips of my fingers. The House of Commons is the best school that any one can go to. It teaches moderation and self-control, and, moreover, it forms the character of men who in their youthful days are members of it. Character is a quality far higher than mere talent, and in my humble opinion forms the one antidote to that universal cleverness as opposed to wisdom, which in my view is the prevailing vice of the present generation. I have ventured to make this small suggestion as to the limit of age at which Peers might become Lords of Parliament. I do so with the utmost diffidence, because I am well aware that I have not the position nor the influence to press upon your Lordships any vital alteration in the constitution of this House, but I did think that it was a matter which might come under discussion in the course of our debate, and I am thankful to the House for having allowed me to place it before them on this occasion.<lb/>
I come now to what I consider to be a subject of the supremest importance with regard to any reform of this House&#x2014;a subject which though not tabled in the Resolutions before the House must be in everybody's mind, and to a certain extent must dominate the whole course of our proceedings with regard to the reform of this House. The subject to which I refer is whether or not we are to include the question of deadlocks between the two Houses in any scheme or in any Resolutions which we put forward. Deadlocks are well known to every country in which there is a two-Chamber system of Government. The solution of the difficulties which they create has been often discussed by constitutional writers. They are the inevitable results of the two-Chamber system, and they are often the desirable results of that system when they call the attention of the country to legislation which it is not yet ready to accept. I think that deadlocks are the inevitable result of that system of government, "one person and two Houses," which Cromwell so warmly advocated. Many schemes have been put forward to meet this difficulty. One scheme, probably the simplest scheme with regard to deadlocks between the two Houses, would be to deprive the Second Chamber of the powers by which deadlock is brought about. Whether we agree with that proposition or not, no one, I think, can deny that it is a very serious one to make, and that it goes to
<col>302</col>
the very root of our Constitution and of the two-Chamber system.<lb/>
I would ask even the most vehement reformer in this direction, Is it necessary that the ultimate Veto, either financial or legislative, should be taken away from the Second Chamber? I ask that question in the interest of the unwritten Constitution. The other day the most rev. Primate, with his usual wisdom, drew the attention of the House to the priceless value of the unwritten Constitution, a possession which has been handed down to us by the wisdom of our ancestors. The advantages of an unwritten Constitution are obvious. It has often been said that the two Houses of Parliament combined are like the celebrated steam-hammer. The two Houses can crack the nut in some vestry reform and at the same time possess the power of checking and determining a dynasty. That is the power of the unwritten Constitution, and I should think its advantages would be manifest, not only to moderate men, but even to the extremest of extreme Radicals. But in establishing a written Constitution, which is the only other way in which we can deal with the matter, we must, as I shall venture to show, also establish a supreme Court. I would ask to be permitted to give an illustration of what I mean.<lb/>
Take what is called the financial Veto. Following upon the action that was taken with regard to the Finance Bill last year, I have heard moderate men on both sides of the House say that they were prepared to consider&#x2014;I do not say they were prepared to accept&#x2014;the laying aside of the financial Veto of this House on certain conditions. What were those conditions? Inevitably that you must have a clause in the same measure which would define "tacking," and which would render "tacking" impossible in the future. Otherwise it is obvious it would be intolerable if a Government, a chance majority of the day, were able to send a Finance Bill, which we were unable to deal with, and join to it some measures which go much further than any finance questions. But, my Lords, let the greatest Parliamentary draftsman of the day make that clause; let it be passed by some of the wisest statesmen of the time as satisfactory; yet I am certain that in a few short years you would have a Finance Bill sent up here, not for our rejection, because the power would have gone, but containing
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0177"/>
<col>303</col>
measures which this House would undoubtedly say were "tacking." The other House would say, "They are not 'tacking.'" What would be the inevitable result? You must have a Court of Appeal, and if you have a Court of Appeal to deal with a statutory obligation, what is that but a supreme Court to which you are referring the Constitution of the country? Therefore I think I have shown that, even in a minor subject with regard to the financial Veto, even touching the very fringe of the subject of limiting the powers of this House, you must inevitably establish a written Constitution and also its companion, a supreme Court.<lb/>
Then I come to what has been called the legislative Veto. For my own part I dislike the word "Veto" altogether. Veto does not, in my humble opinion, define what are the powers of rejection or moderation possessed by this House, and I dislike it personally because it reminds me of the French Revolution, of tumbrils and guillotines. The abolition of the so-called Veto has been advocated in certain quarters, and in very eminent quarters. I am not referring to my noble friends in the Government of the day, but to the leaders of the Labour and the Irish Parties&#x2014;not unimportant factors in the present Parliament. What do these leaders advocate? They advocate that the legislative Veto should be taken away in its entirety from your Lordships' House. There is no talk with these gentlemen of reconstruction. There is no talk of re-modelling and making your House better. They say openly, and quite rightly from their point of view, that they wish to establish a Chamber which would find it impossible to object to measures sent up by a majority of the House of Commons in one Parliament, and in one Parliament alone. That is a proposition which may receive the assent of many in this country, but I do not think it can be denied for a single moment that if you deprive the Second Chamber of its Veto in general legislation&#x2014;and this fact was dwelt on in one of the most striking passages in the speech of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches&#x2014;you must inevitably reduce the Second Chamber to a lower level than any other Senate in the world. That may be right or wrong, but it is the inevitable fact. Is it right that this Imperial Senate&#x2014;for, after all, it is an Imperial Senate, or ought to be&#x2014;is it right that a body of such supreme authority should be placed on a lower level than the Senates of
<col>304</col>
other countries and the Senates of our own Colonies?<lb/>
What are we really seeking to do in these Resolutions and in the re-modelling of the House which my noble friends have advocated? I conclude that we are seeking to reconstruct the Second Chamber so that it should be "strong and efficient." In order to be strong you must be efficient, and to be efficient you must of necessity have the power to be strong. How do those who wish to re-model this Chamber seek to make this House strong and efficient? By giving it the only strength which any constitutional governing body can possibly possess, and that is the confidence of the people whom it seeks to govern. The Government could not deny that in reconstructing this Chamber the object which they have at heart is to give it the confidence of the people; but if, in reconstructing this Assembly, you take away those powers which every other Senate in the world possesses, you are obviously establishing your new Chamber, not on the confidence of the people, but on the distrust of the people. That, my Lords, is surely a very unhappy foundation on which to build our re-modelled Chamber.<lb/>
I heard with pleasure my noble friend Lord Morley the other day using, and I have heard other noble Lords in the Government use, not the phrase "abolition of the Veto," but "limitation of the Veto." The limitation of the Veto is a very different thing from the abolition of the Veto. Limitation has long been considered by constitutional writers, and is in practice to a certain extent in other Senates. The limitation of the Veto consists in finding some means of solving the deadlocks which occasionally arise between the two Houses. There are many ways of bringing that about. I do not commit myself to any one of them. There is the Referendum. There is the reduction of the Upper Chamber to smaller limits, and when a great conflict ensues between the two Houses the two bodies sit together, and if the Government of the day obtain a large majority at the joint sitting&#x2014;perhaps two-thirds or three-fourths&#x2014;in favour of their proposals then the will of the Government of the day should prevail in one Parliament. This is what my noble friends desire to do by taking away the Veto. I venture to think that they can obtain the object which they have in view without depriving this House of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0178"/>
<col>305</col>
those powers which every other Senate in the world possesses.<lb/>
If you submit to the country at the next General Election two policies, one of doing away with the ancient powers of rejection always held by the House of Lords and possessed by every other Senate in the world, and the other of remodelling and bringing it up to date by the limitation of the Veto on constitutional, accepted, and well-known lines, so that a Bill may even become law against the objections of the Second Chamber even in one Parliament&#x2014;if you were to contrast those two measures and place them before the electors the country would say that the one policy was destruction and the other evolution, and I have not the slightest doubt that the policy of evolution would find most favour with public opinion and would be more in harmony with the great traditions of our ancient and historical Constitution, the freest Constitution the world has ever seen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00716"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord in the speech to which we have just listened passed a eulogy, which for all I know may be well deserved, upon the House of Commons. Let me mention to him an incident that occurred to me the other day when I was addressing a large popular audience at Sheffield. I said "The House of Lords wants reform." They all cheered that. Then I added "The House of Commons wants reform a great deal more." They cheered that much more loudly. My views on the subject now under discussion have been so fully stated, with far greater eloquence than I can command, by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, that I should have been very well content to remain silent had it not been that I had been asked to present a petition to your Lordships' House from the British Constitutional Association.<lb/>
This Association is a body of some political importance, and may be held to be very fairly representative of a large body of what is known as moderate opinion. Its president is Mr. Harold Cox, whose name must be familiar to your Lordships. Mr. Harold Cox is not now in Parliament, and the fact that he is not constitutes in itself a somewhat weighty indictment against the Party system as it is now worked and gives also some point to the remarks made by the noble Marquess, Lord
<col>306</col>
Salisbury, yesterday, as to the very great desirability of finding a political home for independent politicians. When Mr. Harold Cox was in Parliament he could hardly be said to have belonged to any particular Party. Indeed, he presented the rather unusual spectacle of a Parliamentary politician who only voted with the Party to which he nominally belonged when he happened to agree with them, and the instances of agreement were, I believe, rather rare. Nevertheless, Mr. Harold Cox's great abilities and high character won for him the respect and esteem, not only of his friends, but of his political foes. I think, therefore, your Lordships will agree with me in holding that the views put forward by Mr. Harold Cox and those acting with him are deserving of respectful consideration. Without quoting at length from what the Association say, I may say that they pray that your Lordships will on no account consent to any diminution of your legislative powers, whether in the matter of finance or in any other matter, and they express the hope that your Lordships will boldly undertake such reformation of the constitution of your House as will add to its weight in the country.<lb/>
During the last few months I have had, perhaps, somewhat exceptional opportunities of gauging what is called moderate opinion in this country, the opinion of those enigmatical persons who are sometimes called the silent voters. They are an extremely important body, but, owing to the fact that they are lacking in organisation, their importance is often rather obscured, and perhaps they do not receive that amount of attention from the Party leaders and managers which on the whole they deserve. I have very little doubt that these moderates exercised a very great influence at the last election. I believe that thousands of voters who in 1906 either voted for the Liberals, or, as I think was more frequently the case, did not vote at all, voted for the Unionist Party in 1910. I have received in the course of the last month or two a very large number of letters from people of this class. Many of them do not agree with the entire political programme which finds favour with noble Lords who sit behind me, but, so far as I can judge, the predominant feeling in their minds at this moment is that the danger of being governed by a single Chamber is so great
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0179"/>
<col>307</col>
that all other matters sink into insignificance beside it. I believe that it was this that rallied the class of which I speak mainly to the Unionist Party during the last election.<lb/>
Let me also mention, incidentally, another point that I observed in the very numerous letters I received from this class of person, and that is, that a great many of them are evidently so disgusted with the state of politics now that they wish to withdraw from any part in political life altogether. Of course, there are always a certain number of people of this description, but I cannot help thinking that the tendency of this body to increase is rather marked at present. It is not an altogether satisfactory symptom, for it will be an evil day for this country when the moderates withdraw altogether from taking a part in politics, and thus leave the field more clear than it is at present for the work of the political agitator. Of the imminence of the danger of a Single Chamber there really can scarcely be a shadow of doubt. His Majesty's present Government appear to have a greater genius for destructive than for constructive policy. By incurring huge liabilities for expenditure without a shadow of a notion as to how the liabilities were to be met when they fell due, they shattered at one blow the whole fiscal system of this country.<lb/>
The Government seem, so far as we can at present understand, to be about to deal with the Constitution on very much the same lines. We do not indeed as yet know the whole of their programme, but we know enough of it to be aware that they propose to knock down all the barriers which have heretofore existed against hasty and ill-considered legislation, and then they hold out to us a shadowy hope that at some future time they may be able to erect some feeble barrier in the place of that which they have destroyed. In other words, what they wish to do is to set going an enormously powerful steam engine without any brake and without any safety valve, and then to trust to the off-chance of being able to supply these necessary parts of the machinery at some later time. I cannot think that this is a wise or a statesmanlike policy. Moreover, I do not in the least believe that His Majesty's present Government will ever be able to provide those important
<col>308</col>
parts of the machinery, and for the very simple reason that, whatever views may be held amongst the moderates of then Party, the extremists of their Party, who have evidently got the upper hand, will never allow them to do anything of the kind. It is impossible to blame the extremists, for their position is not only perfectly comprehensible but perfectly logical.<lb/>
An eminent Frenchman, Montalembert, once said that England was fortunately not the slave of pedantic logic. As one who has had some part in carrying out that extraordinary jumble of contradictory ideas which sometimes goes by the name of British policy, I have often wished that the British nation was a little more logical. It is certain, however, that the extremists among the Radical Party cannot be charged with any want of logic. From that point of view their habits of thought are purely Continental. They know what they want, and how to adapt their means to an end. They know perfectly well that unless the Second Chamber is either swept away or reduced to a nullity there is not the ghost of a chance of ever carrying out the whole of their political programme.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite often lament that their Party is in such numerical inferiority in this House. That has been very fully recognised by noble Lords on this side, and we all hope that as a result of the discussion now going on something will be done to remedy this defect. But whatever is done by His Majesty's Government or by any other Party in the State with a view to constituting a reformed Second House, I feel perfectly certain that nothing short of sweeping away the Second Chamber or reducing it to a nullity will ever produce a majority in favour of some of the most fundamental propositions of the Radical Party. Once give a man security of tenure and let him express his unbiassed opinion, then, whether he enters this House by the hereditary principle or by any possible form of election, you may depend upon it he will be opposed to many of the fundamental principles of the Radical Party. I remember some twenty-five years ago, when Home Rule was under discussion, an eminent Radical writer said:&#x2014;
<quote>"As to the House of Lords, make 500 sweeps Peers and pass the Bill."</quote>
The late Lord Salisbury, with that remark-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0180"/>
<col>309</col>
able sense of humour which he possessed, said he though the idea was very well worth considering, but he wished to point out that, judging by all experience, it would be necessary before long to appoint 1,000 more sweeps to out-vote the first 500, who would certainly have crossed the floor of the House.<lb/>
My Lords, I venture to think the most essential point in all these discussions is that the powers of this House should remain intact. I cannot but think that the question of composition, important though it certainly is, falls into the second rank, and must be regarded, if not exclusively, at all events mainly, from the point of view of how those powers can best be maintained intact. When I speak of powers I cannot for the moment agree that any distinction can be made between powers over general legislation and financial powers. Indeed, I cannot help thinking that in the course of these discussions occasionally too much importance has been attached to a technical definition of what is known as "tacking." I observe that those organs of the Radical Press which are in favour of a weak and emasculated Second Chamber recognise that some adequate guarantees ought to be taken against tacking. I do not believe it would be in the smallest degree possible to construct any guarantees that would be adequate, and if we get guarantees on paper I am convinced that they will be perfectly illusory in practice. Within the four corners of a strictly Financial Bill, which cannot, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, be interfered with by your Lordships' House, it will be perfectly possible to destroy almost every existing institution in this country. What, I should like to know, is to prevent a Socialist House of Commons from destroying private property by placing an Income Tax of 20<i>s</i>. in the pound on every man who has over &#x00A3;500 a year? That would be a purely financial measure and would not come at all under the definition of "tacking."<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Ribblesdale, alluded yesterday to the possibility of coming to some compromise on this question, particularly, I think, on the question of finance, when we know the scheme of His Majesty's Government more fully. I should be the last to Bay a word against compromise. It is always a word that is balm of Gilead to the moderate politician. I think I remember many years ago reading a very able
<col>310</col>
work by the noble Viscount opposite in which he launched some rather fiery literary anathemas against people who believed in compromise. I remember perfectly well agreeing with him at the time, but I have changed my opinions a good deal since, and so, I have no doubt, has the noble Viscount. I am very doubtful whether on point this any compromise is possible. The divergence between us is too great to be bridged over by any possible concession on minor points. The nation must decide on this essential point. I do, therefore, hope that for the present, and until the nation has decided, we shall resist any attempt to diminish the financial powers now possessed by the House of Lords quite as stoutly as we should resist any proposal to diminish the control over general legislation. But, my Lords, I think it is generally conceded that in order that this resistance should be effective some reform must be made to bring this House more in touch than is at present possible with the people of this country.<lb/>
Among those with whom I am most politically associated I have heard but one voice upon the subject. They say, "Above all things maintain your powers intact; that is what we care most about. As regards composition, diminish your numbers but do not on any account abolish the hereditary principle; supplement it by the introduction of an outside element, and, as regards those hereditary Peers who remain, adopt some reasonable method of selection." Those are, I understand, the lines generally of the proposals of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, and they are, I cannot help thinking, the wisest lines on which to proceed. Of course, there are many different ways of bringing in an outside element, and I do not propose to deal with them now, for I have no doubt we shall have opportunity later on of fully discussing the question. Lord Curzon said he thought probably every noble Lord on this side of the House had a scheme for the reform of the House of Lords in his pocket. In that case I must claim to be an exception, for I have no sort of favourite scheme of my own; but the general lines sketched out by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches commend themselves to me more than any I have yet heard. At the same time I think it is of such vital importance to secure unity of action in this matter that I consider we ought to be prepared to make every possible sacrifice of our personal opinions in order that that unity of action shall be secured.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0181"/>
<col>311</col>
There is one point to which I should like to draw your Lordships' attention. I do not suppose that anybody who has any respect or reverence for the past, or who wishes to preserve a statesmanlike continuity in the development of our institutions, can view without a pang of regret, and perhaps some feeling of apprehension, any attempt to lay hands on the time-honoured institution to which we belong. But as circumstances force us to do so, I would earnestly beg your Lordships to do so boldly. I feel certain that if we do not act with boldness in this matter we shall disappoint many of our natural allies and supporters in this country. The more boldly we act the stronger becomes our position for maintaining our legislative and financial powers, and that, I repeat, is the main point. On the other hand, if we deal weakly with reform we by so much strengthen the hands of all those who wish to take away our powers. Constituted as this House is, I find it very difficult to believe that we are likely to go too far in the direction of reform. I cannot help thinking that if there is a danger it may be that we shall not go far enough.<lb/>
I should like to allude, before sitting down, to one or two points which arise out of the speeches that have already been made on this subject. The noble Viscount opposite, in the very interesting speech to which we listened two nights ago, dwelt on many points, some of which have been already answered by noble Lords behind me, but there were one or two to which I do not think any allusion has yet been made. If I understood the noble Viscount correctly, he held that there was some rather glaring inconsistency in extending electoral power, as was done some years ago, with the full consent of your Lordships' House, and then constituting a strong and efficient Second Chamber which would, to a certain extent, diminish that electoral power. The noble Viscount characterised this as a retrograde measure. He appeared, I think, to hold that we were taking away with one hand what we granted with the other. I really cannot see any inconsistency in these two measures. On the contrary, I venture to think that the creation of a really strong and efficient Second Chamber is almost a necessary corollary of the extension of electoral power, for surely all history and experience go to show that the wider the basis on which the electorate rests the more is it necessary to have an efficient brake in order to prevent any passing wave of ephemeral passion
<col>312</col>
being misconstrued into a really matured expression of popular opinion.<lb/>
No speaker, except the noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, has dealt with what appeared to me to be one of the strongest points in the arguments of the noble Earl the other day. I mean that portion of his very eloquent speech in which he pointed out that every foreign country&#x2014;with the exception of Greece and Costa Rica&#x2014;and all the self-governing British Colonies had strong Second Chambers possessing powers certainly not inferior to those we claim both over general legislation and over finance. Lord Sheffield, in reply to that statement, said that he did not think much profit could be obtained from looking at the institutions of other nations. My Lords, I admire the sturdy patriotism of the noble Lord, and of course I agree that the institutions of every country must be adapted to the habits and ideas of its inhabitants, but perhaps it is because I have lived so much abroad that I cannot altogether accept the idea that this country possesses an absolute monopoly of political wisdom. Surely we cannot afford to neglect the teaching of other countries. Is the democracy here so little headstrong, so little in need of control, that we can afford to neglect what is happening elsewhere? Surely not. Then the noble Lord went on to say, with reference to the noble Earl's remark about the Colonies, that it was quite true the self-governing Colonies now had Second Chambers, but he urged that if the choice were put to them whether they would rather have single-Chamber government or a Second Chamber composed of hereditary legislators they would unquestionably choose single-Chamber government. I have not the least idea whether they would or would not do so. But if this is the argument of the noble Lord and his friends, why in the world do they not co-operate with us in endeavouring to remove those blots from the hereditary system which they so much condemn?<lb/>
In point of fact, the moment one touches this aspect of the question one realises how very difficult it is to come to close quarters with the Liberal Party on this matter. They instantly fall into two separate and distinct camps. One says, "We do not in any way want to destroy the hereditary character of the Second Chamber because we know that, so long as you are an hereditary legislature, you will possess no real power, and it will suit us very much better
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0182"/>
<col>313</col>
to keep you in existence as a sham Chamber than to have no Second Chamber at all." The other, if we may judge from a speech recently delivered by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, says, "We want a Second Chamber which is to be wholly elective." As regards that, all one need say is that in as much as the proposal of the right hon. gentleman and those who agree with him involves the taking away of all effective power from the Second Chamber, it really does not in the smallest degree matter whether it is constituted of hereditary legislators or of people entirely elected.<lb/>
There are, as the noble Earl and Lord Cawdor remarked the other day, three ways of settling this question. One is to constitute a strong and efficient Second Chamber such as we wish. The second is to give single-Chamber government, which is the desire of the extreme Radicals. The third is to constitute a sham Second Chamber, which will delude the people who want some protection and lull then into a sense of illusory security. Unfortunately it appears so far as we can at present judge that it is the third of these proposals which finds most favour in the eyes of His Majesty's Government, and I entirely agree with what has fallen from other speakers on the subject, that, of the three proposals, this is incomparably the worst. I would infinitely prefer a single-Chamber, because if we were to have a single-Chamber government I think it is pretty certain that that institution would instantly set to work to dig its own grave, and that, before it had existed long, it would be swept away amid the universal indignation which its proceedings would arouse.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00717"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to address your Lordships at any length, because I am more concerned at present to show that in voting for the noble Earl's proposal I am not committing myself to any one of the three things that he wants to discuss. I want to make it quite clear that I am not committed to any one of them. I believe they would be all more or less mischievous, and the third, which he speaks of as the foundation of them all, I regard as the most mischievous of all. I cannot help thinking that the wide extent over which this discussion has spread has to some extent concealed the nature of the difficulties with which it is proposed to deal. Nothing could be easier than to say that this matter ought to be remedied or the
<col>314</col>
other matter ought to be remedied, but until you have a concrete scheme placed before you it is impossible to discuss the problem with anything like practical efficiency.<lb/>
I observe that all those who have engaged in this discussion have availed themselves very naturally, of this mode of discussing an abstract question. Such and such a thing is undesirable. Well, no one can say that any human institution is perfect. These are commonplaces that everybody will accept. I do not believe that it is possible to make an institution more consonant with our habits and more practically useful than the House of Lords as at present constituted. I am quite aware that there are some people who would say, This is an old obstinate Tory refuge; you do not want to interfere with anything. Well, there is something in not being too fascinated with everything that is new. But, on the other hand, I absolutely deny that it is a characteristic either of my friends behind me or of myself that we will not accept any improvement. Before we accept an improvement, however, and before we abolish something that is working well, it is practical wisdom not to get rid of that which you have until you know what is to be established in its place. My Lords, we have had what has been described as something which can be placed before you in the nature of a concrete system, and I think the noble Earl who moved this Resolution was induced to say that it was the unanimous Report of the Committee. I will show presently what sort of unanimity it was; in the meantime I would like to say that it was not unanimous. I myself dissented from almost every proposition, and, although I may be disposed of in the way I suggested just now, still you have no right to say that a body is unanimous when one member of it at all events dissents.<lb/>
Let me say here, in passing, that I do not believe that the conflict which may be said now to rage on every occasion of a General Election around the House of Lords would be got rid of by any of the propositions which were submitted, as it is said, twenty years ago. I am quite aware that at one time there were a certain number of ambitious young gentlemen, the eldest sons of Peers, who objected to be turned out of the House of Commons because they were succeeding to their fathers' Peerages. They were young, and they will not repudiate the imputation. But one of the objections
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0183"/>
<col>315</col>
made, I think, to the Peers who succeed to their fathers is that they are too young when they succeed, and that these ambitious young gentlemen might be still members under a new system if the new system restricted the succession to a Peerage to persons of thirty years of age and over. Whether that would satisfy them or not I do not know. But if it would not, I cannot at all understand why they should be eligible for the House of Commons. Very likely the answer will be that they are elected. Yes, so they are, but is it perfectly certain that the people who elect them are all so intelligent as to recognise the intelligence of those whom they elect and their fitness for acting as legislators?<lb/>
Let me turn now to what is described as this unanimous Committee, and let me say I am not at all endeavouring to criticise the noble Lord who was responsible for the appointment of that Committee. He made a most amusing speech last night, and I think we were all most grateful to him for relieving the heaviness of some part of this Debate with the jokes that he gave us. I do not mean to say there was not a great deal of truth in what he said; in fact, his speech was a great example of how to mix up with a good deal of fun a considerable amount of wisdom. I have therefore no complaint to make against the noble Lord. Now to go back for a moment to the Report of this Committee. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee have fully considered various proposals which have been laid before them with the object of readjusting the political balance in the House of Lords."</quote>
That, be it observed, is what had been put before the Committee. They continue&#x2014;
<quote>"Within recent years the House of Lords has been criticised not so much for any alleged incapacity to perform efficiently its legislative functions as on account of the uneven distribution of political Parties within its walls."</quote>
Let me say here that I heard that observation made in the House of Commons for a different purpose. I think my noble friend opposite who has a strong view on proportional representation was encountered by Mr. John Bright on one occasion when he was pointing out how very hard it was that the minority were not able to be represented. Mr. Bright said, with the common sense that distinguished him&#x2014;
<quote>"Then let those who are in a minority preach their gospel to the country until they become the majority, but they must not ask to become a majority while they are a minority."</quote>
<col>316</col>
Then the Committee say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is obvious that difficulties between the two Houses must arise when a Government is in power which is supported by a large majority in the House of Commons and only by a small minority in the House of Lords."</quote>
That is very likely and that undoubtedly is true. Let us see what are the Committee's remedies&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee have come unanimously to the conclusion that the existing evil could not be remedied by flooding the House with permanent Peerages, which do not by any means imply permanent politics&#x2014;"</quote>
That is true&#x2014;
<quote>"and thus not unfrequently help to defeat the objects which they were created to promote, and to increase the disproportion they were intended to diminish. They are also unable to recommend that a certain number of Peers chosen because they are supporters of the Government of the day should be summoned to sit and vote in the House of Lords for the duration of a Parliament or of a Government. They consider that such Lords of Parliament would be in a position anomalous as regards the House and unsatisfactory as regards themselves."</quote>
I am reading this partly as an object lesson. We have to consider this in the abstract. There is a wish that the House may be improved. But notice what the improvements are that are suggested. Because the Government in this House are in a minority the suggestion is made that you should have a certain number of&#x2014;what shall I call them? I really do not know&#x2014;apprentices or something of that sort, for there is no security that they would be permanent, to assist His Majesty's Government while they are in office. Then the Committee go on&#x2014;
<quote>"In order to bring the House more into harmony with changes of political opinion in the country&#x2014;"</quote>
I have a question to ask presently about this matter of which we have heard so much. I have over and over again heard repeated the words "to bring this House in touch with the opinions of the country." It is such a delightful thing to have a phrase which ends a sentence and appears to have some meaning. Bring this House in touch with the opinions of the country! The Committee say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee would then have proceeded to inquire whether another and more complete solution of the difficulty caused by a possible deadlock between the two Houses on a question of grave importance might not be attained by proceeding as a last resort to refer the issue to the electorate by means of the constitutional expedient known as the Referendum. But, though much might be said in favour of such a proposal, the majority of the Committee felt that to discuss it, or formulate an opinion upon it, would be beyond the limits imposed upon them by their Order of Reference."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0184"/>
<col>317</col>
Let me look at the Order of Reference for a moment. It was moved&#x2014;
<quote>"That a Select Committee be appointed further to consider the suggestions which have from time to time been made for increasing the efficiency of the House of Lords in matters affecting legislation, and to report as to the desirability of adopting them either in their original or in some modified form."</quote>
The Committee met, and, among other things, they determined that there should be a preliminary committee appointed to consider questions which should be submitted to the Committee. I had not the honour of being a member of that sub-committee, and at the first meeting of the Committee that I was able to attend I found that it had already been decided as a preliminary matter that the right of succession to this House should be beyond the Inquiry, so that on future occasions when I attempted to discuss it I was barred on the ground that it had already been decided. That was the mode in which this question was deliberately decided in this unanimous Committee. My Lords, I confess, that for myself I do not believe&#x2014;and perhaps I ought not to have been a member of the Committee&#x2014;in your getting a better House than you have. I know some think that it ought to be made stronger. I rather think the noble Earl himself said it ought to be made stronger with a view to passing the Home Rule Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00723"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I will pass that by. Another suggestion now, certainly not by the noble Earl, is that it should be made weaker for the purpose of passing a Home Rule Bill, but this time it is because the House of Lords is assumed to be the one block in the way of passing a Home Rule Bill. It strikes me very strongly that the
<col>318</col>
reason why this House has for a good many centuries preserved itself, and preserved the country, is that, except on very great occasions, it has followed the lead of the House of Commons. But if you are going to make it so much stronger&#x2014;and you must make it so much stronger according to your views&#x2014;that it can from time to time override the House of Commons my impression is that you will have, as in other countries, continual conflicts between the two Houses. I want to know what is the intention of His Majesty's Government. I do not know why they should think it proper to move Resolutions or to bring in a Bill applicable to this House. What would be said of us if we were to send down a Bill for the reform of the House of Commons? Are they so proud of their institution that they think it cannot be improved? There are a good many people who think it might be improved very much. Well, what the proposals of the Government in regard to the House of Lords amount to, we shall see when they are proposed. But in the meantime it is denied that the House of Lords has any right to deal with finance. That is the great question which, at the Election and elsewhere, has been promulgated throughout the country. It seems to have been forgotten that by the 25th of Edward I it is enacted that no tax shall be imposed except with the goodwill of the Archbishops, Barons, Earls, and so on. That is still an existing Act of Parliament, be it remembered. I think it would be idle to go back again and discuss what we discussed on the Budget Resolution. I do not understand how any constitutional practice which has the sanction of an Act of Parliament can be said to be wrong. An Act of Parliament must exist until it is repealed by the two Houses of Parliament, and that Act still stands on the Statute Book and justifies what we have done. We have been denounced as having acted unconstitutionally, as having upset the Constitution, as having established a new precedent, and so on; but that Act of Parliament has not been mentioned. I do not think it was mentioned except when I mentioned it myself in the Budget Debate. Nobody else has ever referred to it. To say that this House has not the right to obey an Act of Parliament is a somewhat strong proposition.<lb/>
Now I want to know why it is that the Government, having advised His Majesty to dissolve Parliament in order that the feeling of the country with regard to the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0185"/>
<col>319</col>
Budget might be ascertained, do not now submit that Budget to the House of Commons. Is it not because they know that if they do so the Budget will be rejected by the House of Commons? What is the meaning of all these negotiations with Mr. Redmond? Why is not the question plainly asked at once? The Government majority may be turned into a minority. That is not to be done. I do not want to detain your Lordships longer because I hope we shall go into Committee on this matter. I think it would be naturally imputed to us that we were afraid of having a discussion if we refused to go into Committee. Having gone into Committee, I hope I shall listen with proper attention to what is put forward and then I shall form my own judgment. But I absolutely refuse to be considered as being committed to any one of the three Resolutions by now agreeing to our going into Committee. I do not believe that any actual scheme will be put before us as a whole, and if it is not I defy the wit of man to suggest how in three Resolutions, or in thirty Resolutions for that matter, can be solved the questions which come before us from time to time when we differ from the other House. What we have to do, I think, is what we have done hitherto&#x2014;our duty, and our duty is to consider the questions brought before us and determine them, not, as is now apparently considered to be the proper thing, at the dictation of the Prime Minister of the time, but on their merits. This House has over and over again in my experience refused to obey the suggestion of a Prime Minister if it did not approve of a Bill. It has been my duty from the Woolsack from time to time to put the question when it has been against the wish of the Minister for the time being, and this has been in accordance with the right of freedom. Once it is laid down by the Prime Minister that we are to obey him and his Party&#x2014;well, I for one, protest against any such system. I do not deny what my political convictions are, and I act according to them. But I repudiate the idea that the House of Lords should be under the thumb of any Prime Minister or political Party. I utterly repudiate that, and this House has over and over again asserted its independence.<lb/>
I do not know what the views of His Majesty's Ministers are as to a Second Chamber. They speak on this question with two voices. One voice declares that it is impossible to get on without a Second
<col>320</col>
Chamber; that it would mean "Sudden death and something else"&#x2014;I will not repeat the other word that has been used in the presence of the Bishops&#x2014;if the Second Chamber were got rid of. On the other hand, speeches have been delivered which can only be regarded as an attempt to raise class against class by intimating that the House of Lords has nothing at heart but to hurt and to oppress the people. At any rate, I shall reserve my opinion until the proposals of the Government are produced; and then I shall be able to deal in a concrete manner with that which is now airy, beautiful, and eloquent, but which has nothing to do, even in the smallest degree, with practical legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00724"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, anything I say after the speech to which we have just listened must suffer very much in comparison. I notice that we do not get many Peers on the opposite side of the House to answer the Peers who speak on this side. I understand the House of Lords is either going to be done away with altogether, or else it is going to be reformed in such a way that all the "backwoodsmen," of whom I am one, will not appear in its debates any more. I therefore ask your Lordships' indulgence while you listen, if you will do so, to the swan-song of a humble backwoodsman. In approaching this question, I was very much struck with the spirit in which it was dealt with by Lord Curzon. The noble Lord did not approach it in a spirit of panic, and we cannot do better, in discussing it, than quote from a speech which he made, and which I always quote myself when I am upon a platform and wish to defend the existence of the House of Lords. It was a speech delivered at Oldham during the election campaign. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have nothing to apologise for, nothing to extenuate, and nothing to be ashamed of."</quote>
If that were true then, as I certainly think it was, how much more true is it now? That speech was delivered before the result of the General Election was made known, and before the new House of Commons sat. After that speech was delivered, in spite of every sort of misrepresentation, in spite of the extraordinary majority the Liberal Party had before, in spite of every calumny&#x2014;for it is a calumny to say that we rejected the Budget in order to save our pockets, and it is a greater calumny coming from a Cabinet Minister&#x2014;in spite of the fact
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0186"/>
<col>321</col>
that you had on the other side the marvellous luck of the old age pension story invented by Mr. Ure, there is no majority in the new House of Commons in support of the Budget. I am not saying that on my own authority. They are Mr. Snowden's words. He has said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is no use discussing the matter; there is no majority in the House of Commons for the Budget."</quote>
And the refreshing fruit which was going to be pressed to the parched lips of the multitude has had to be put away in the cupboard along with the family skeleton, which it is almost bad taste to mention now in the presence of a Radical.<lb/>
I desire to approach the question of the reform of the House of Lords from a different point of view from that of the noble Earl who opened this Debate. He gave the House one piece of advice about the Budget, and I ventured, in my humble way, to give quite a different piece of advice. I am glad you followed the advice I was rash enough to offer to your Lordships on the last occasion, in very good company be it said. What I suggest with great submission to your Lordships is that if we had played into the hands of the Radical Party&#x2014;they kept on hoping against hope up to the last minute that we were going to pass the Budget that would have been the negation of the whole rights and privileges of the Second Chamber&#x2014;this discussion about the reform of the House of Lords would be utterly and entirely out of place. The noble Earl told us that our children and our grandchildren would be grateful to us for having reformed the House of Lords. I daresay others will be; but if there is anything at all in the hereditary principle I am perfectly certain my posterity will be much more grateful to the House of Lords for having stood between the country and Socialism, which it was proposed to force upon us against the wishes of the majority of the electors. What I want, before we talk so much about reforming the House of Lords, is to hear a little more about the functions of the House of Lords. That seems to be the important point. Do those who think the present House of Lords is not all it should be suggest that if you have a new House of Lords its functions will be the same? Will the new House of Lords be equally able to reject the kind of Budget we were confronted with last session? It is no use labouring the point. We are already a very efficient body.
<col>322</col>
I suppose we may say this within these doors. I constantly say it out of doors, so I suppose it is all right. I may quote the authority of a Statesman who we shall all agree is the greatest Member of Parliament now living. I allude to Mr. Balfour, who told the City the other day that the House of Lords is efficient. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Never have its duties been carried out at a higher level; never has it held more men of great experience, of great knowledge of affairs, of great public spirit."</quote>
That must make us swell with pride. Not only that, but it happens to be absolutely true.<lb/>
Before we go on to the question of the reformed House of Lords, I tell you that I am perfectly ready to go down to the country to-morrow and speak in any constituency you like&#x2014;either in Scotland, or Wales, or England, or Ireland, if one is allowed a fair hearing, as I am sure one would be&#x2014;and I am prepared on the public platform to take on the House of Lords question as it is at the present moment&#x2014;backwoodsmen, Budget, black sheep and all. Very often I went down to meetings during the election where I was told with bated breath by the organisers beforehand to talk about anything I liked but not to mention the House of Lords. I always went straight on to the platform and dealt with the question at considerable length, and I found that the audiences which I had the privilege to address&#x2014;I did not speak in Scotland but I spoke in almost every county in England south of the Tweed&#x2014;took an extremely intelligent, though sometimes rather hostile, interest in the subject. Are we to go down, after this campaign, and tell the country that, after all, the rejection of the Budget&#x2014;and when I say the rejection of the Budget I desire noble Lords opposite to understand I mean reference to the people, but rejection is shorter&#x2014;are we to say that this was only a <i>tour de force</i> on our part, and that we really had no right to do it? Lord Curzon has explained, in a most statesmanlike manner and in an argument which must command the respect and adherence of those who heard it, that, after all, this is not a bad time to undertake reform; but do not let us stultify ourselves by the negation of the principle of heredity. Are we to tell the country, either that we consider ourselves unworthy sons of our fathers or incapable of begetting a suitable posterity?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0187"/>
<col>323</col>
I have been brought up in the midst of stock-breeding of all kinds all my life, and I am prepared to defend the hereditary principle in that or any other animal&#x2014;whether the principle is applied to Peers or whether it is applied to foxhounds. If you desire to ennoble the blood, shall we say, of any particular foxhound, to place him on your book, you look in him for a mixture, a combination, of sagacity and good looks, having made due inquiries into the same qualifications in his immediate progenitors. I am perfectly aware of the unsoundness of the hereditary argument as it is applied to the scientific breeding of hereditary legislators; but, at the same time, although the scientific breeding of Peers may have been, to a certain extent, lost sight of, that is the very reason why the hereditary families who have taken an interest in the government of this country are as strong in the estimation of their fellow-countrymen as they are to-day. It is the very influx of fresh blood through marrying from what I believe are called "the people," whoever they may be&#x2014;through marrying from outside&#x2014;that has saved us from the weakness and debility that attach to a caste, and I do not think that any analogy can possibly be drawn between the nobility, or country gentlemen, or aristocracy, or whatever you like to call it, of 150 and 120 years ago and the French aristocracy. Any such analogy cannot possibly be regarded with anything except a feeling almost of resentment. The French aristocracy were weak, selfish, and tyrannical and I believe they richly deserved the fate they got.<lb/>
When the French aristocracy were leading a life which was so entirely divorced from the aspirations of the people as to produce the French Revolution, that was the very moment that Mr. Pitt saw the danger of the Government of this country falling into hands which were of too patrician a character. He thought that the House of Commons was composed too entirely of patricians. I do not know what he would have thought of the last House of Commons. How he altered that has already been told us. He got a plebeian aristocracy and blended it with the patrician oligarchy in the House of Lords; he made Peers of second-rate squires and fat graziers; he caught them from the alleys of Lombard-street and clutched them from the counting-houses of Cornhill. That has already been told
<col>324</col>
us in the words of a master in the opening pages of "Sybil." The democratisation of the Peerage and the influx of fresh blood from outside has been going on ever since. Radical Cabinets between them have had no inconsiderable share in appointing their own friends, those of their own political complexion, to seats in this House. Not only that, but the country-gentleman class, which has taken an interest in the government of this country, has shown a remarkable vitality. Mr. Lecky has said that there is no truer sign of the vitality of a class than the way in which it adapts itself to changed conditions, and that is what, I respectfully maintain, the class of country gentlemen has done. There is also a feature about the country-gentleman class which has been a very great disappointment indeed to a certain type of Radical who thought that the County Councils Act, and the Parish Council Acts, and other Acts of that kind were going to do away with the domination of what they called the squire and parson once and for all. But they revived again in a very remarkable way in the last election, and caused the wrath of Mr. Ure at the sycophancy of the "sleepy cathedral cities" and the towns where he thought the influence of the Peers was undue. I can well imagine the sentences in which Mr. Ure would have slobbered over the agricultural labourers and proclaimed them free men to the rest of the world supposing they had voted for the Radical Party.<lb/>
But not only that. This class which is largely represented in both Houses of Parliament&#x2014;what I may call, if I may say so without offence, the hereditary governing class to which the backwoodsmen may belong&#x2014;are the very people who, when anybody wants anything done in the country, are looked to to do it. They are the only people who have made your Territorial Army possible. When you wanted assistance to get up the Territorial Army you had to go down to the country and appeal to the patriotism of the particular class which Mr. Lloyd George is doing his very best to destroy. The Red Cross Society, which is a pendant to the Territorial Force, is being run in exactly the same way. But the House of Lords has been democratised from within as well as from without. There is not the slightest doubt about
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0188"/>
<col>325</col>
that. I have not very much experience of this House myself, but those who have been here long will tell you that of late years the tendency of all members of the House of Lords to take an interest in, and to speak in, its debates is very much on the increase. It is very largely due, if I may say so, to the great kindness shown to the younger members of the House by our Leader, Lord Lansdowne, who has encouraged the taking part in debates and has been responsible for a great deal more attendance at this House than the younger men would otherwise have given. And the contention that used to be made by Bagehot and writers of that type that the best cure for admiration of the House of Lords was to go and look at it has fallen quite out of date. They talk about the non-attendance in the House of Lords. What about the non-attendance in the House of Commons? Is it worse for a Peer to go out hunting all day and to come up in the evening and take part in the division than it is for a member of the House of Commons to sit in a chair in the smoking-room or in some other place all the afternoon only waiting for the division bell to ring and then rush in to say "Am I to vote 'Aye' or 'No'"? I think that if the electors who are always shouting themselves hoarse on platforms about the blessings of representative Government were to come down and have a look at the House of Commons and see how things are carried on there we should not hear quite so much about the way in which things are carried on in the House of Lords.<lb/>
In considering this question of the reform of the House of Lords we must not think only of ourselves; we must think of the point of view from which people outside the House of Lords approach this question. We must first of all, in order to clear up the subject, have regard to the point of view of the official Radical Party. I shall not labour the point. They have had a shocking bad time during this debate, and I think it would be almost cruel to rub it in. I cannot congratulate them on the show the friends whom they brought here for the purpose have made in supporting them. They say that they are proposing to limit the Veto of the House of Lords. That is only playing with words. No limitation of the Veto you can possibly propose, no
<col>326</col>
method of dealing with the House of Lords of any sort that you can possibly propose short of what is virtually abolition, will satisfy your followers. They have already told you so. They are telling you so every day. None of us have seen the scheme you are going to produce, but you cannot produce any scheme which will satisfy your own Party unless it means practically the abolition of the House of Lords altogether. If you have a House of Lords without a Veto that means the abolition of the House of Lords. A House of Lords without a Veto would be like a grin without a cat, and just about as effective as that would be.<lb/>
The Radical position seems to be this. You went to the country with one of the most magnificent majorities that any political Party ever had. You yielded to your extreme Party; you introduced at the bidding of the Socialists a Budget which the people did not really want. You now come back and say that the system of all civilised countries, which is good enough for all civilised countries, and which you yourselves thought was good enough for your Colonies&#x2014;that that system is too good for the Old Country, and that you cannot govern England unless you are allowed to take up the same model as Lord Rosebery told us belongs to Greece and Costa Rica. The grievance that has been most insisted upon from the Radical Front Bench is that Conservative Bills receive what is called different treatment from Radical measures. Earl Carrington said that the question was whether the Radical Party should have a share in the legislation of the country. He said that they had got no share in the legislation of the country. That is not the view which is taken by his colleagues when they go down to the country to make speeches. There are two propositions entirely contradictory which they generally make in the same speech. They say, first of all, that they have passed more Bills than any other Government has ever done before. They say, secondly, that they were entirely crippled because of the House of Lords. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking at Cardiff, said that the present Government had carried more Bills through, in the course of two years, in spite of the antiquated procedure, than any Government that had ever preceded it. Mr. Haldane said not
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0189"/>
<col>327</col>
very long ago that whenever the nation had been in earnest with a measure the House of Lords had in the end been no obstacle. Then we had Lord Morley's memorable saying that for all great and effective purposes you have now got single-Chamber government. How hollow must all this attack upon the House of Lords be if that is really the case! It seems to me the position of noble Lords opposite in the matter of legislation is like that of Sir Anthony Absolute, who was compliance itself when he was not thwarted&#x2014;"no one more easily led when I have my own way." Provided you have a House of Lords which will grease the wheels of revolution, butter the slide of Socialism, that is the sort of Second Chamber you would, no doubt, like to have. I want some Radical Peer to tell me what he means by legislation. Is legislation something which the people of the country really desire, or is it a thing to tickle the fancy of some Cabinet Minister? I defy you to point to any Tory measure which has been passed by the House of Lords which the people did not really want, or to any measure which has been rejected by the House of Lords about which the people of this country were really in earnest.<lb/>
I had the privilege of speaking on a good many platforms at the last General Election. We came across three points of view with regard to the House of Lords. There were, first of all, those who said down with the House of Lords altogether! That is a perfectly intelligible view. I think a certain number of people, like the Socialists, do take that point of view. Now, I submit to those who are so anxious for the reform of the House of Lords that you are not going to buy off those people with any reform of the House of Lords that you may propose. I am told that this view obtains in Scotland. It obtains among people who are good friends with their landlords, and who may be thought, perhaps, to be of the same political hue. It obtains among people who will be your companions, your henchmen, your friends, who live for you, who will die for you, and do anything in the world for you except vote for you. Those are the sort of people whom you are not going to buy off with any reform of the House of Lords. There are others who wish the House of Lords to be elected by the same constituencies
<col>328</col>
that elect the House of Commons. That consideration has already been dealt with by Lord Curzon. I do not think those people in the least know what they are in for when they propose that. I think they have at the back of their minds some sort of idea of a House of Lords in which Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr. Keir Hardie would sit side by side and which would pass all the measures of the Socialists.<lb/>
There is another class, which is a very large one indeed. I do not believe that half so many of the ordinary electors in this country take an overwhelming interest in the Constitution as a lot of people think they do. I believe it was Mr. Burke who said that the people of this country looked to the performance of a Constitution much more than to the way in which it was composed, and what they look to the Constitution of this country for is to provide a suitable system of national defence for them and to see to the social welfare of the country. I do not think those people are very much interested in this question of the reform of the House of Lords, and they are re-inforced by those who hold the same view as Lord Halsbury, with which view, I venture to say, I have the greatest sympathy. I know that I am laying myself open to the charge of being a hopeless and hide-bound Tory when I say that I have sympathy with those views. I do believe that the old House of Lords&#x2014;we have already begun to talk about it as the old House of Lords&#x2014;I do believe that the House of Lords as it is now would have weathered the storm, supposing that you had left it alone. It has weathered a good many storms before. Lord Rosebery reminded us what an agitation there was against the House of Lords in 1832, and he also told us of that very picturesque placard which Mr. Gladstone saw on the way up to London&#x2014;a placard which must have made the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade turn green with envy when they heard of it. But I have no doubt that down in Wales they express the same idea in the Welsh language.<lb/>
There is a third class who think that the reform of the House of Lords will strengthen it and will be able to oppose an answer to unjust and unfair criticisms against it.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0190"/>
<col>329</col>
All I have to say about that is that I listened most attentively to the speech of Lord Curzon, and that speech seems to me to be a most convincing defence of the House of Lords as it stands to-day. If you want to go down to the country and explain to an audience what a good thing the present House of Lords is you cannot possibly do better than repeat the speech of Lord Curzon. Nothing could have been more unanswerable, nothing could have been stronger. The difficulty we shall have in the debates next week with regard to reforming the House of Lords will be to find that point at which you can buy off the opposition of people who are opposed to the House of Lords as it is now, and also to make that point coincide with the point beyond which you cannot go without fear of destroying something valuable and something that you want to keep. Lord Newton seemed to knock a great deal out of his argument by the concluding sentences of his speech in which he said that supposing the whole thing were carried into effect he did not think that, after all, the House of Lords would be very much more efficient than it is at the present moment and that our decisions would be pretty much the same as they are now. If that is the case, I, for one, sincerely hope that we shall approach this question with the very greatest care, with the very greatest thought, and with the very greatest caution, with the idea, first of all, of preserving the continuity of tradition which has been such a valuable force to this House in the past.<lb/>
In dealing with this ancient fabric you may, perhaps, put in hot water pipes and the electric light with impunity. You may even put in the vacuum cleaner, an instrument which I particularly dread, in order to get rid of the rubbish. But I did not like the rather drastic way in which Lord Newton, it seemed to me, proposed to set about it; and as a backwoodsman who is no doubt going to suffer by the process, I must say that I thought the noble Lord had, like Uncle Oliver in "The School for Scandal," an unforgiving eye and a damned disinheriting countenance. Lord Halsbury is believed to be the only adamantine Tory who is resolutely opposed to reform. There was one noble Lord who is not here because death has deprived us of his invaluable counsel and advice. I refer to Lord
<col>330</col>
Robertson. I do not know whether your Lordships remember the very weighty speech he made on the same lines as Lord Halsbury when Lord Newton's proposals were first brought forward. I well remember that speech. In it he exhorted us to think more than once before we forsook the old paths. He further advised the House not to too readily catch at a scheme which would very likely give you a great many quick wits, which would pack the House with, perhaps, a great many of the picked intellects of the kingdom, for in doing that you would be changing what is a certainty for what is an uncertainty, and at the same time getting rid of people who are a valuable help. They are men who are trusted by their friends and neighbours, and for whom, as Lord Robertson said, the people in the country have a very great feeling of respect. They are men who, if they do not quite understand a question in the House of Lords, do not speak about it and perhaps stay away from the debate. I wish to thank your Lordships for the kind way in which you have listened to what I have had to say. I do not look forward hopefully to the future, because I think that everybody who is turned out of the House of Lords will have a great deal of difficulty in finding a constituency to send him to the House of Commons. You will go down to the party organisation and say "I have been turned out of the House of Lords. Am I any good to you?" And I should think they will very likely answer, "Not much."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00725"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF STRADBROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although the greatest courtesy is always shown to anyone addressing your Lordships' House, I do not think such toleration would have been granted had it become the custom for members to follow one another in succession, using the same arguments over and over again, in vain repetition, as is sometimes done in another place. It is the ambition of many men to be returned to Parliament by election, but the opportunity may not have occurred to some of us sitting in this House because of our having succeeded to a Peerage early in life, as was my own case. But I think, speaking generally, that those members of this House who have sat in the House of Commons are listened to as speaking with greater authority than those who have not had the privilege of sitting there. This, however, seems to me to be an occasion
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0191"/>
<col>331</col>
on which those who have not, perhaps, held an Office of State, or who have not sat in the House of Commons, but yet have taken their part in public life by serving on county councils or helping the old Volunteers and the modern Territorials, in fact those who have generally carried out the working details of Acts of Parliament, should express an opinion on this question of the reform of the House.<lb/>
It has always been the pride of this House to carry out what is felt to be the wish of the majority of the people, and I think that time has proved that this House has not made very many mistakes in its judgment. Now that expressions of opinion have been uttered throughout the country to the effect that it is desirable that reforms should take place in the constitution of this House, your Lordships are showing, by the debate now in progress, that you are willing and anxious to consider what can be done to bring the House of Lords into accordance with the spirit of the day. Personally, I hope very much that this change may be effected without destroying the hereditary principle, because I feel sure that if the hereditary principle is entirely destroyed a very severe blow will be struck at our Constitution, a blow much harder than is realised or intended by many of those who advocate it, as far as this House is concerned. In the course of this debate it has, I think, been generally admitted that this House has become too large, and that it would be more efficacious if it were fewer in numbers. I feel that that objection could be got over by a process of election. If the principle is admitted that the fact of possessing a Peerage should not also carry the right to sit in this House, it would, I think, destroy at once the argument that there might be sitting here those who are not qualified to sit and vote in a Second Chamber.<lb/>
In the Report that was published by the Committee of this House which sat to discuss this question of reform, the suggestion was made that a reduction might be made in the number of right rev. Prelates in this House. If that were carried into effect it would afford an opportunity to introduce representatives of other great religious denominations, who, like the occupants of the Episcopal Bench, would be recognised as not belonging to any
<col>332</col>
political party, and who would speak with great weight on questions relating to education and social reform. Naturally any reform that effects a reduction of members of your Lordships' House would entail considerable self-sacrifice on the part of many who now have the right to sit here, but your Lordships' House is the very last Assembly in the world that would let personal consideration interfere with any reform that was felt to be for the advantage of the country. I feel sure that we shall all approach this question with the one wish to maintain the integrity, the independence, and the efficiency of this House, and at the same time to remove those causes which might tend to undermine the faith of the country in this Chamber. For these reasons I shall have pleasure in supporting the Resolution.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00727"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is not the first time that the noble Earl who moved this Motion two nights ago has brought the question of the reform of this House to your Lordships' notice. It is some twenty or twenty-five years since he made his first speech on this subject, and if he had had his way on that occasion I presume that I and many other noble Lords in this House would not have had an opportunity of entering its portals at so early a stage in our lives. I feel, therefore, in a sense, that I am somewhat of an interloper in this Debate, and I trust that the few remarks that I shall venture to make to your Lordships on the subject of the reform of this House will be taken by noble Lords on this side with that amiability and kindly consideration which are invariably shown to noble Lords who speak in this Chamber.<lb/>
In listening to this Debate I confess I have not been quite able to understand the exact length to which we are going and how far we are committed. So far as I gather from the Report of the Committee which has been presented to this House and from the words which have fallen from the noble Earl and other speakers, we are to have two bodies&#x2014;one a body of Peers elected by their brother Peers, the other a body from outside elected by county councils. The noble Lord,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0192"/>
<col>333</col>
Lord Newton, told us last night that he did not think that the election of Peers by their fellow Peers would on the whole be a workable proposition. In support of this view he adduced many arguments which seem to me very weighty, full of profound thought, and backed up by very considered judgment. On the other hand, the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, reminded your Lordships, with that profound and careful political instinct which is the hereditary quality of his house&#x2014;we cannot get away from hereditary qualities&#x2014;that it would be very dangerous and unwise to try to alter the balance which exists between the two Houses of Parliament. That seemed to me to be a very sound and a very right view to take. I therefore feel that, although the noble Marquess was not on this Committee, he represented the feelings and views of some who were upon it.<lb/>
We therefore realise on the second night of this Debate that, although the noble Earl who initiated it told us that the Committee were unanimous, there are noble Lords connected or associated with this Committee whose opinions, I will not say are totally divergent, but at any rate present a great disparity. Since there is this difference between some of those whom Lord Newton rightly described as the most distinguished and celebrated of noble Lords in this House, perhaps it is not inappropriate and will not be taken amiss by noble Lords on this side if I put forward some suggestions that we should be cautious and careful in any alterations we make in the composition of this House. I feel sure your Lordships will realise that I do not wish to approach the consideration of the Report of this Committee in too critical a spirit, because I know from the slight Parliamentary experience I have had what an amount of labour, thought, and care the members of that Committee must have given to the subject.<lb/>
It has been suggested, as I have already said, that a certain number of Peers should be elected from the whole body of your Lordships' House. I cannot help feeling that if this proposal was put into practice and there was a deadlock&#x2014;and it is only when there is a deadlock between the two Houses that these issues are criticised and discussed&#x2014;the very first

criticism which would be made by the British public, or rather by those who are believers in Radical demagogues, would be this: that the representatives of the House of Lords had refused to accept one of their measures simply because they were the representatives of a small and narrow franchise, a franchise which your Lordships yourselves, in a way, have repudiated because you say that some of your number are not worthy to sit with you. We are told that it is difficult to defend the hereditary principle before the British public at the present time. I cannot conceive anything more difficult than to try to defend your position in this House as the delegates of noble Lords whom you have already said are not sufficiently qualified or sufficiently useful to associate with you in this Chamber.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there is the question of electing representatives to your Lordships' House by the county councils. I confess that I have grave doubts as to whether it is wise to employ local authorities for political purposes. After all, local self-government is still on its trial. We hope it may succeed and that it will be fruitful of good results, but the criticism levelled against local self-government is this, that the people take too little interest in their local affairs. I cannot help thinking that if you employ the machinery of a county council for the purpose which has been suggested, you are going, not to stimulate local feeling in matters appertaining to local self-government, but to intensify party passions in local bodies. Moreover, I am not enamoured of the suggested composition of the House. I feel that the two elements would work in harmoniously in combination. If there were a deadlock between the two Houses I feel that the elected Lords would come down to this House and, in virtue of their position would put forward the views of the localities which had elected them and would try to brow-beat the noble Lords who still remained here by virtue of the hereditary basis, and who endeavoured, as we do to-day, to keep in harmony with the general feeling of the country.<lb/>
Experience has invariably shown that the elected representatives in a Second Chamber are far more reactionary in their views than hereditary representatives, and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0193"/>
<col>335</col>
I foresee that the hereditary Lords will have to go on the platforms of England and justify, in their hereditary position, the misdeeds of their elected co-Peers in this Chamber. I cannot help feeling that this combination of the elective and the hereditary element will produce a hopeless internal contradiction, and that the new House so created will display a faulty mechanism instead of what we really want&#x2014;a wholesome and a healthy organism. I believe you can get no better illustration of the views I put forward than in the present position of the French Senate. Originally there were some seventy or eighty life Senators. It was found that the views they expressed and the position they occupied were not in harmony with the rest of the House, and the life principle was accordingly abandoned after nine years of experiment.<lb/>
In listening to this debate I have asked myself, What are the charges which can really be brought against your Lordships' House? In the first place, there is what is known as the "black sheep" argument. It is hinted that certain noble Lords in this House would be wiser if they did not appear in it. That may or may not be so. I am not quite concerned on that point, and I do not think the British public are either. After all, it is impossible in any assembly to assume that everybody can rise to the standard of, let us say, a lay bishop. I do not think, knowing the British public to a certain extent, that they attach much importance to that criticism, and I feel sure that that was not the message which the noble Earl brought from Scotland.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, it is suggested that the size of this House is too large and that there are superfluous members. But the superfluous members generally do not come, and I have been at pains to understand why it is necessary to invent an elaborate system in order to get rid of those who do not come here when by the very fact of their not coming you have already got what you want. Then it is suggested that the attendance in this House is by no means that which some noble Lords would wish. That may or may not be the case, but I feel sure of this, that there are a great number of noble Lords who are willing and glad to come here
<col>336</col>
when there are good debates, and that if the noble Earl on the Cross Benches would only promise to come here regularly and deliver in this House more of his eloquent addresses, he, at any rate, would have no cause to complain of the attendance of noble Lords. Indeed, we had a practical experience of that only the other day. The noble Earl, in addressing this House, was anxious for a moment to sit down during an interposition by a noble Lord, but so anxious were noble Lords on this side of the House to hear his speech that every available space was occupied and he could only find a means of repose by reclining in the arms of the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury. But it is clear that you cannot expect a greater attendance of noble Lords in this House if we do not resort more to having divisions. I do not wish in any way to criticise my noble friends the Whips of the Party on this side of the House, but I feel sure they know well that it is useless to ask noble Lords to come continually to this House if after a long debate they are allowed to go home and are not invited to record their opinions in the Division Lobby.<lb/>
It has been suggested as another charge that the work of this House has not been well done. I feel sure the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees will say that the work of this House that is done in Committee is excellent in every way. Noble Lords attend and do their work as well and efficiently as the work in Committee is done in the other House of Parliament. If the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor were here I would ask him whether he could not say that in debate the methods and the language employed in your Lordships' House were at least equal to the standard which he has known in the House of Commons. It has been asserted, and I think with some justice, that there are too many Tory Peers, and that the division between the Liberal Party and the Tory Party has been accentuated to a very remarkable degree. The Duke of Northumberland last night stated that that was due to the action of Mr. Gladstone in driving over to this side of the House a great number of his followers and supporters. I do not feel quite sure that that is entirely true. Nor do I believe that it would be wrong to add that in the opinion of many, in the opinion of most of his fellow countrymen, the noble Earl the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0194"/>
<col>337</col>
mover of the Resolution might himself have attempted to redress that balance, but for various reasons has failed to do so. It would be presumptuous on my part to criticise in any way the political action of the noble Earl. Obviously the decisions which he makes are entirely his own affair. But I do say this: If it is true, as many think, that the noble Earl by his action might have redressed that balance, it is rather a strong order that the criticism of one-sidedness should be employed by one of his own colleagues on this Committee, Lord Newton, as one of the main reasons why some 250 noble Lords in this House should be asked to absent themselves in perpetuity.<lb/>
After all, what is the gravamen of the charge against this House? It is based on the hereditary principle. I should like for one moment to look at facts with regard to that. This House&#x2014;I am not speaking of the more distinguished members of it only but of the House as a whole&#x2014;is prepared to transact the ordinary affairs of the nation in a businesslike and sensible manner. What is more, they set to work in a manner understood by the people of this country. It is because of this that in great crises, when we wished to discover whether we were in touch with the views of the electors, we proved ourselves to be right. That was so in the year 1893, in the year 1908, and, we believe, also in the year 1909. These are facts from which you cannot get away, and in the face of them I believe that the hereditary principle is merely an incident.<lb/>
It has been said that the hereditary principle is out of harmony with the aspirations of the British public and is incompatible with modern democracy. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, who spoke tonight with so much eloquence, was at pains to discover some method of reorganisation of this House. If I understood the theme of his argument properly, the one thing he was searching for, and rightly searching for, was that your Lordships should be in sympathy with your fellow-countrymen throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain. I do not believe that you will achieve that result by any mere cloudy verbiage in an Act of Parliament or by the reconstitution of this House in any way or form that you like.
<col>338</col>
If you wish to be in harmony with the wishes of the British public, any re-organisation necessary must take place, first of all, within yourselves. The noble Lord dwelt upon the success of his campaign in the United Kingdom in addressing large audiences, and also reminded us that the House of Commons had now given us the priceless privilege of being allowed to confront and be confronted by our fellow-countrymen at times of General Election. I cannot help feeling that in the periods between one election and another it is really impossible for a Peer to come into close contact with his fellow-countrymen on any very big problem. People are apathetic and do not care. But at General Elections we are given an opportunity of meeting our fellow-countrymen at times of political excitement, when the British public have been pushed forward by demagogues to attack members of this House. I believe the fact that we can now grapple with our adversaries and can show that we are prepared to do what we can to solve those social, political, and Imperial problems which are before us, will do much to remove the impression that your Lordships' House is out of sympathy with the feelings of the general body of the community.<lb/>
The noble Marquess reminded us last night that the power of the House of Commons was passing away. We know that the Executive to-day exercises an influence in the House of Commons which was unknown in previous years. We desire to preserve a check in this House which will counterbalance the lack of check which now exists in the House of Commons. I agree with my noble friend that we ought not to possess co-ordinate powers with the Lower House, but I desire to see this House as a complement to the Lower House. All we desire to do is to exercise a check at moments of crisis, and I do not believe that any noble Lord with any feeling of self-respect would dream of exercising functions in this House, if the so-called Veto was taken away from us. But surely, my Lords&#x2014;and this is the point I wish to emphasise&#x2014;the moment you declare that the basis of this House should be elective you weaken that check, and you weaken it at the very moment when it should be strongest. It is at moments of excitement that public opinion is excited and exasperated; and it is at
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0195"/>
<col>339</col>
such moments that it would be said, if the House were elective, that it was out of touch and sympathy with the source of its authority. One of two things will then happen&#x2014;either your Lordships' powers will be entirely swept away, or we shall be told that we have to strengthen the sources of our authority, and, consequently, we shall have to broaden the basis of the electorate which elects us.<lb/>
Then observe what will follow. If we decide to derive our authority from a more comprehensive electorate, the members of this House will claim co-ordinate powers with the Lower House. Then indeed, my Lords, we may look forward to a deadlock. The composition of this House will be entirely changed, and it will be no longer what I desire to see it&#x2014;the complement of the Lower House of Parliament. Instead we shall see a great number of the members here representing bureaucracy and plutocracy. And upon my soul I do believe that it will be a very bad day's work for the democracy of England if they exchange the present composition of your Lordships' House for the nominees of the plutocrat and the bureaucrat.<lb/>
Before I sit down may I say one brief word with regard to the hereditary principle? It is now asserted by many that personal service to the State should be the standard by which you should select noble Lords for this House. I confess that I do not very much like the principle of personal service to the State. I think it is a changing and ambiguous term, subject to constant changes as generation follows generation. I infinitely prefer the hereditary title. I believe it is far more in harmony with the inclinations and the wishes of the nation as a whole. I will tell your Lordships why. The individual himself has no natural rights whatsoever. All his rights are inherited rights. All the great Charters of liberty assert the hereditary rights and privileges and liberties of the British public. The lawyers who drew up the Charters were much too clever to base the liberties of the British people on anything except hereditary rights. The power of the House of Commons itself is based upon hereditary rights. What did the House of Commons assert last year when this House took upon itself to consult the people with regard to the
<col>340</col>
Budget? The House of Commons asserted, rightly or wrongly, that they alone were entitled to initiate and control the finances of the country. They did not say they had an actual right, they asserted that they had a historic right, and they appealed to the precedents of three centuries.<lb/>
My Lords, the conclusions I arrive at are these. You have on the one hand the hereditary rights of the people, and on the other hand the hereditary privileges and prerogatives, and I may add also the Veto, of the Crown. Why, then, are we to believe that our own title to a voice in the administration of the country is not as firmly established on the principle of heredity? If the noble Earl the mover of this Resolution tells us that the qualification for membership of this House should be based upon personal service to the State, and, as I understand, that is rather the view contained in the Committee's Report&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

But the noble Earl goes to his fellow-countrymen and says, "You have only rights," and he comes here and says, "You have only duties."</membercontribution></p>

<col>341</col>
of his argument and invite the British public also to contribute some personal service to the State.<lb/>
I frankly confess that I am in favour of the present composition of this House. I believe it works very well in practice. There may be a few criticisms to pass upon it, but I do not know that they are very weighty or very serious. I have grave doubts whether it is possible to combine the hereditary and the elective principle. I believe that that process is bound to break down eventually, and you will be driven to the absolutely illogical position of making this House into an elective Assembly on a broad franchise, thus turning it from an aristocratic into a bureaucratic and plutocratic body. I do not believe the democracy is going to be well served by that change. I for my part desire to accept the first Resolution which the noble Earl has brought forward, but I sincerely trust with regard to the other Resolutions, which seem to me rather to be based on the shifting shoals of expediency, that noble Lords will ponder deeply before, alter a few nights debate, we permit the noble Earl, pen in hand, to write the epitaph on the work of six centuries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00732"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should have hesitated very much, as a new and recent member of your Lordships' House, to intervene in what is a full dress debate, a debate of primary and cardinal importance, a debate which is bound to have very far-reaching consequences, had it not been for some remarks which fell from the noble Earl when he was introducing the subject and moving the Resolution that is attached to his name, remarks in which he animadverted upon and criticised a certain communication which I recently made, short in character, to one of the London daily papers. Upon those grounds I venture to make a few observations. I can only say that they shall be as brief and contracted into as narrow a compass as possible.<lb/>
This debate has travelled over a very wide and a very interesting field. It has ranged over topics so various in their form that it is almost difficult now to select any one that is not already worn and
<col>342</col>
threadbare, and I venture to suggest to your Lordships that a large number of those topics might well have been left over to have been more fully debated when the proposals of His Majesty's Government with regard to the House of Lords were before the two Houses of Parliament. The great bulk of the noble Earl's speech was directed to a discussion of the comparative advantages or demerits, and also the relative characteristics, of one Chamber as apart from two-Chamber government. I propose to leave that topic almost entirely alone. It seems to me that upon it we are arguing very much in the dark. We are fulminating against and demolishing hypothetical bogies which may never have had an existence or may never be brought to light. I do not think we can take it for granted throughout this discussion that it is the object of His Majesty's Government to propose anything akin to a single Chamber form of government.<lb/>
I am well aware of, and recognise fully, the declaration of the Prime Minister which was cited to the House by the most rev. Primate last night upon the question of the Veto. That was a text upon which many a sermon might be preached and Resolutions founded, but even if that were not the case I think your Lordships are men of the world enough to know that the contents bill of a newspaper is often very much more blood-curdling than the columns of that paper itself when perused. I am fortified in that opinion after reading the speech of Sir Edward Grey, which was published in yesterday morning's newspapers. The Foreign Secretary is one of the most important members of the Government. Sir Edward Grey is one of the coolest-headed members of the Government. Indeed, my Lords, so cool-headed is he that I sometimes think that his brain is a kind of cold-storage department from which ideas and phrases are derived in a congealed and frozen state, and were the Foreign Secretary ever to give utterance to a foolish or hasty or excitable sentiment I should almost lose faith in humanity. Sir Edward Grey has said himself that he was in favour of a two-Chamber form of Government. Therefore I think in a measure we can leave any discussion of that point on one side. I may say this, that if the Government were to propose anything in the nature of one-Chamber government, or any Legislature that was
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0197"/>
<col>343</col>
limited to one Chamber, I should myself oppose it just as much as any noble Lord upon that side of the House, and I believe it would find very few supporters likewise upon this side.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred in his speech to some imaginary entity that he called a a Chief Whip's conscience. I can assure the noble Earl that such a thing does not exist. Any Chief Whip worth his salt has no political conscience whatsoever, nor does he hold the conscience of his Party in his hands, as was suggested by the noble Earl. He is a very valuable piece of Party mechanism. He does what he is told. When he is instructed to go he goeth; when he is instructed to come he Cometh; and when he is told he must whip for any self-evident proposition, such as that black is white, he does so with the same alacrity and eagerness as if he believed it. Therefore, my Lords, so far as the actions of the Chief Whip are concerned, no conclusion must be drawn from them. The noble Lord, Lord Newton, as is his wont, hurled across the floor in friendly fashion sneers at certain Lords elected to your House, who immediately they got their seats here lost all their previous habits and customs and political convictions, and could not help assimilating their views with those of noble Lords opposite. I, my Lords, am not one of those individuals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00733"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has not been here long enough.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00734"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: It is true that I have not been here long, but however long I remain in this House I can assure the noble Lord that I shall always remain a very ardent and earnest, and, I hope, a progressive Liberal. Every week of my life, I may inform him, I become more Liberal and Radical in my opinions. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, in introducing this debate to-night, said that I had in my letter to the paper&#x2014;I hope noble Lords will permit me just to refer to one paragraph of it&#x2014;denounced the Campbell Bannerman Motion in the House of Commons. My Lords, I did nothing of the kind. I only referred to it incidentally to say that I was then in disagreement with it, as I am now, and that was then known to the leaders of my Party. I only
<col>344</col>
expressed those views in order to attach to them a further expression of my opinion, in perfect good faith, an opinion which I desire to put forward as a humble and respectful warning to the Government and the Party to which I have the honour to belong, that anything in the nature of a single-Chamber proposal emanating from them would, so far as our Party is concerned, entail upon us untold perils and disasters whenever we were to endeavour to translate it at a General Election before an audience of our fellow-countrymen.<lb/>
I desire to point out that there was in my humble judgment a plan, practical and feasible in character, not infringing the dignity of this House, not trenching on any of its liberties, whereby Liberal principles embodied in Liberal Bills could be got through both Houses of Parliament; and, further, I thought by the adoption of that scheme Liberalism would be greatly benefited and buttressed throughout the country, and candidates standing as Liberals would be greatly advantaged thereby. I have, as the noble Lord said, only been a member of this House for a very brief period, but two things I have learnt to appreciate here. First of all, the great ability with which the debates are conducted, an ability of quite as high a level as we had in the House of Commons, that is, perhaps, praising it as much as I, as a House of Commons man, can; secondly, the fair-mindedness that seems to actuate every member of this Assembly.<lb/>
But I wonder if noble Lords have ever realised the position of Liberals and Liberalism both in the House of Commons and throughout the country. I wonder if it would be too much to ask noble Lords on that side of the House to put themselves in the position of Liberals at the present juncture and under the present form of Government. The position of Liberals at present is absolutely intolerable. It could not possibly continue. No Party with any shred of self-respect, with any pride, with any dignity, with any sense of responsibility, would continue to occupy the position which the Liberal Party has been obliged to occupy during the last four or five years. We are engaged in continuous political warfare with noble Lords upon that side of the House, and with what I will call, I hope in no disagree-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0198"/>
<col>345</col>
able way, the Tory Party in this country. Throughout the whole of that warfare the dice have been loaded against us, and noble Lords on that side of the House, and Tories throughout the country, are playing this game with us on the principle of "heads I win, tails you lose." We cannot possibly win. We go down to the electioneering sea in ships, and we strive, and we work, and we contend, and we fight, and we canvass, and we do all we can to secure a majority, and sometimes, my Lords, we do secure a majority in the House of Commons. During the last Parliament we had a phenomenal, a record, majority, the greatest that has ever existed, something like 300; but, my Lords, even if we had been able to secure Liberal representation in every constituency throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, had we been able to return one solid homogeneous Liberal Party, we should have been no nearer our ends or our goal than we were during the last Parliament, and than we are at the present time. The Tory Party in the country, you noble Lords sitting upon that side of the House, are permanently in power, and you can prevent at any time our Bills from passing. You can alter them; you can distort them; you can maul and mutilate them, as we think; and you can reject them, and now you go so far as to think that you can send us back to the country whenever you, in your lordly wisdom, think right.<lb/>
I ask you, my Lords, is that a fair state of things to continue, or to be allowed to continue? To use a familiar phrase, it is not what I call political cricket. I know the House of Lords have frequently expressed their willingness to bow to the will of the people whenever that will is made manifest. First of all, I would say the Liberal Party never did allow that the House of Lords ever had the right to send us to the country, or to force a Dissolution. But even if I were to allow that contention for one moment, you cannot have a Dissolution upon every Radical or Liberal Bill that comes up here from the House of Commons which is repugnant to your Lordships' feelings. Let me take one little instance. I am pursuing this line of argument&#x2014;it may not seem very closely connected with the Resolution before us&#x2014;in order to prove
<col>346</col>
as far as I can that, however you reform this House from within, and whatever the constitution of this House may be so long as you have a Conservative&#x2014;a Unionist&#x2014;majority in it, and so long a it fails to be a reflex and a mirror of political opinion and public opinion outside, you cannot remove these grievances and these injustices under which Liberalism suffers at the present time unless you deal with the question of the Veto.<lb/>
Let me take one small instance. Almost the first Bill that your Lordships rejected in the last Parliament was a Bill entitled the Plural Voting Bill, a Bill minor in its character, but for us Liberals a Bill of very great and vital importance. One can hardly conceive, amongst the numerous great topics that exercised men's minds during the last Parliament, that we could have a General Election on that Bill, important as we considered it; and on how many occasions would the House of Commons have had to send that Plural Voting Bill up to your Lordships in order to get it passed, even though your Lordships were assured by the fact that this Bill was continually coming up that the feeling of the country was in favour of it? I am an electioneerer of old standing, and I have spoken on as many political platforms as probably any noble Lord in this House, and not only on one side but on both sides, because I sat in two Parliaments as a Conservative Member. Perhaps I might borrow the noble Lord, Lord Ribblesdale's, phrase the other night when I mention that I do not see that that has anything to do with the subject we are now discussing. My Lords, I have seldom found any really unbiassed Conservative in favour of the continuance of a system by which rich men who had a multiplicity of this world's goods should go about the country purchasing voting power wherever they choose, and swamping the opinion of local electorates when elections are with us. Is it to be wondered at that Liberals rebel and chafe against this state of affairs, and that they cannot agree that a solution of it is found by having an election on all these minor topics?<lb/>
The noble Earl says that all this is to be solved by the reform of your Lordships' House. I cannot see myself how reform pro-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0199"/>
<col>347</col>
ceding from within this House can remove these great and glaring injustices that the Liberal Party suffers. I believe it has been quoted before in your Lordships' House that the late Lord Salisbury said, and it will bear quotation again, that there is only a certain amount of political power in this country, and that that is now enjoyed in the greatest degree by the House of Commons, and anything you grant to the House of Lords will act in depreciation of the powers of the House of Commons. I think there is a great deal to be said for that. But I think what we Liberals require first of all, and it seems a platitude to say it, is by statutory enactment&#x2014;not by voluntary concession on the part of noble Lords, or by their permission, or from their kindness of spirit, but by Statute&#x2014;to prevent this House from continually rejecting Liberal Bills, even when it is discovered that the country is in favour of those Bills. If that were once gained, and if we could in some measure devise a plan by which this Veto question could be dealt with, then I say reform ourselves, and do whatever we like in this Assembly; but the House of Lords should not stand against the continued wish and will of the people. I think we are all agreed upon this, that a Second Chamber should not be obliged to bow to any fleeting or spasmodic idea which catches the people and rushes them off their feet. Every great reform in this country ought to fight every inch of its march of progress; every great reform ought to work out to the fullest extent its own salvation. I venture to suggest that that has been done, and that your noble House ought not to stand in the way.<lb/>
We are told that the House of Lords represents a national bulwark. With the greatest respect to it, I say that is not its function. It ought to be, to borrow a phrase from the great game of golf, a national bunker, difficult to get over, big and broad and hard to negotiate, but one which we ought to be able to negotiate under certain circumstances. So, my Lords, I venture to suggest that the province of this House is to delay, obstruct, oppose, retard, criticise, and thrash out Bills to the utmost extent of its ability; but the Liberal Party should have a statutory right, not only by Dissolution, to secure its own measures when its Bills are found to be the express wish of the country, great and small, passed into law. Therefore, the first step should not be exactly the reform of the House of Lords,
<col>348</col>
but the devising of some form of machinery which should give effect to this great object and purpose.<lb/>
I venture to think that your Lordships yourselves on that side of the House are willing and anxious to find out some method and some such plan. You cannot conceive your present position to be a satisfactory one. You cannot be comfortable; you cannot be happy, possessing the sense of fairness which you do, in the perpetuation of the present inequitable system between the two great Parties in the State; and I am sure it ought to be the wish of every noble Lord on both sides of the House to possess powers of criticising and dealing with Bills without the great paraphernalia of a General Election. In that way they might find a happy exit from an untenable position when they find that the will of the country is against them. I have no doubt that most of your Lordships have seen a plan adumbrated in one of the Liberal morning papers regarding the operation of a great Senate. Any such plan as that would have my most sincere support and assistance. But failing such a plan as that by the Government, which would be almost cataclysmic in its character, I venture to suggest that the plan I have elaborated is the only plan by which, suffering some delay, we Liberals could get our Bills through the House of Lords, and it is still my belief that it would be the wiser one at the present juncture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00735"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not going to quarrel with the noble Lord who has just sat down on account of his belief in the infallibility of the new leaders to whom he has so lately attached himself. We may feel glad that his political doubts are now at rest, and that he has found peace for his political conscience. I shall have occasion to express real sympathy with the grievance of the Radical Party, to which the noble Lord devoted the greater part of his speech, but all that I wish to say with regard to the noble Lord's remarks at the present moment is that it seems to me that his conception of the functions of a Second Chamber is as faulty as the metaphor by which he illustrated them. He chose a metaphor from the game of golf. I am not a golf player myself, but I have always understood that the object of a bunker was to punish a faulty player. In that case, if the metaphor be a true one, then the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0200"/>
<col>349</col>
Second Chamber is perfectly justified in punishing unconstitutional action on the part of the popular Chamber.<lb/>
I hope the noble Duke who opened the debate after dinner this evening will not think I am discourteous if I do not follow him into the mazes of his argument. His interesting speech, which was certainly not lacking in courage and was nothing if not original, seemed to me, if he will forgive my saying so, rather wide of the mark. As I understand it, the only question before us at the present moment is whether or not it is expedient that we should discuss the question of House of Lords reform. We have not even got to the stage of considering whether or not reform is desirable. The question which the noble Earl has put to us is simply whether we should discuss that question, and it seems to me altogether irrelevant and inappropriate to enter into a discussion of possible schemes of reform and their possible effects. I shall confine myself, therefore, to a few remarks on the question whether or not we should consider the subject of reform.<lb/>
My reasons for intervening in the debate are, I hope, not immodest. I do not hope to be able to contribute anything to the argument on the question, but I have two distinct reasons for asking your Lordships' indulgence. The first is that I am one of those who have spoken on public platforms and on public occasions during the past few months, and in doing so I have advocated, after full deliberation, the reform of the House of Lords. I desire, therefore, to take an early opportunity of making good what I have said, and giving the best proof I can that I was sincere in saying it. My second reason is this. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Stradbroke, in his remark that this is an occasion above all others when all sorts and conditions of members of this House should express their opinion. I imagine that it is a case of <i>quot homines tot sententiae</i>, and that it is only from the mass of varying opinions of the members of this House, whether the most eminent or the most insignificant, that it will be possible to deduce any general principle upon which most of us are agreed.<lb/>
I think it is all the more desirable that as many of us as possible should express our
<col>350</col>
opinions because it is perfectly certain that whatever we do and whatever we decide we shall be grossly misrepresented. I do not doubt that the noble Earl the Leader of the House will say of our decision, as he has said of a former decision, that it is an imposture. We shall not easily forget that remark of the noble Earl in spite of the polished phrases and the smooth professions which he uses in this House. I dare say also that the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War, who I regret is not in his place, will say, puffed up with all that knowledge and wisdom which are generated spontaneously in the brain of a half-fledged Under-Secretary, that he has noticed with astonishment and dismay the crass ignorance which prevails among the members of your Lordships' House, and I am afraid that there are other noble Lords opposite who will feel obliged also as a sacrifice to political consistency to indulge in the practice of fouling their own nest.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, those misrepresentations, I think we can see already, will be of a threefold character. In the first place, we shall be told that those of us who advocate reform are insincere in our expression of willingness to submit to changes. Secondly, we shall be told that we are putting forward a new intolerable pretension or arrogant claim in saying we ought to carry out our own internal reform; and, thirdly, we shall be told, as we are being told already, that any expression of willingness to undergo reform is a confession that the action of the House of Lords in the past was mistaken and unjustifiable, that the House of Lords as an institution is indefensible, and that our opinions have undergone a complete transformation. In regard to the first of those misrepresentations we can only prove our sincerity by our actions, and that is why I agree with the noble Earl who introduced this question and those who support him in the view that prompt action is most important and desirable. I think that the second misrepresentation has already been disposed of so far as this debate is concerned. It has, of course, never entered the heads of any of those who are engaged in this movement for considering reform that any change will be brought about by Resolutions of this House. That extraordinary notion only exists in the imaginations of noble Lords opposite, and of the writers in the Radical Press. But the third misrepresentation demands, I think, some further argument. I confess I was
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0201"/>
<col>351</col>
very much surprised that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India should have adopted a gibe which forms the stock-in-trade of the crude writers in the Radical Press. I must admit that when I first saw it I regarded it as a somewhat feeble gibe, but since it has been adopted by the noble Viscount we must treat it, I suppose, seriously.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said that any expression of willingness to submit to reform was a transformation, that it was a confession that our action in the past had been wrong, that it was an admission that the House of Lords, as an institution, was indefensible, and so forth. Well, my Lords, our answer to that is that we do not admit, not one of us admits for a single moment, that the House of Lords is indefensible either from the point of view of constitutional theory or on the showing of history and our past record. We are ready, every one of us, when the time comes, to defend the hereditary principle as it exists in this House at the present time. We are ready to defend it both in theory and in practice, even though we may be willing, on grounds of national expediency, that it should be limited to a certain extent. Our position is this. We admit, on the principle that no human institutions are perfect and that changing circumstances oblige corresponding changes even in the best of institutions, that there are things about the constitution of this House which might, with advantage, be changed. We admit that it would be possible and we believe that it would be desirable to effect improvement by some changes of the kind which has been suggested. Our position, further, is that we admit that this House is unpopular with a large section of the nation, and that that unpopularity is not likely to be transient. Recognising as we do that that unpopularity diminishes the authority of this House and impairs its usefulness as a national institution, we are willing to consent to changes which will enable us to discharge our functions without that friction which is so disastrous to national unity. I am speaking for those with whom I agree, of course, and I say that we are anxious to do so at the present time because we believe that there never was a time when national unity was of more vital importance.<lb/>
It is agreed by men of all parties that the nation has reached a great and grave crisis in her destinies and we are meeting
<col>352</col>
that crisis, not as a united people animated by one sole idea as to what is best for the nation as a whole, but as a conglomeration of bitterly contending factions; and feeling that the present constitution of this House is an obstacle to the attainment of that national unity, we are willing and anxious to submit as soon as possible to a change. That attitude, I maintain, does not in any way involve an admission of incompetence or of failure in the past. It is merely a recognition of the existence of changing circumstances and an expression of willingness to conform to them. It is an expression of our desire to avoid disaster, not to ourselves as individuals or to this House as an institution, but to the nation and the Empire at large. A business firm may change its methods or its system without in any way implying that it has been a failure in the past or that its work has been conducted on mistaken lines. We may take to building "Dreadnoughts" instead of the more antiquated form of battleship without in any way laying ourselves open to the charge that in years gone by our Fleet was inadequate and defective for its purpose.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, what are these changing conditions which have brought us to this opinion? I think, in the first place, there is a profound modification in the old system of two Parties. That modification seems to me to be due to the disappearance of the old Liberal Party. There are Liberals, my Lords, but they sit on the Unionist side of both Houses, and the most prominent among them is the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think anyone can deny that the old balance of Parties in the State has disappeared, and its place has been taken by a coalition on the one side of different Parties who have no real fundamental political principles in common. Whig and Tory, Conservative and Liberal, were agreed on fundamental principles; they did not wish to alter materially, certainly not to break up or destroy, the constitutional machine. They wished to continue to work it, and the only difference between them was one, not of principle, but of degree. The difference of opinion between them was in regard to the rate at which progress was to be ground out of the political machine, or a difference of opinion as to the order in which the material for manufacture should be subjected to the pro-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0202"/>
<col>353</col>
cesses of reform. But now, my Lords, the differences are, I think, fundamental. Some of the new Parties which have arisen aim at the radical, fundamental reconstruction, not only of the Constitution, but of society at large.<lb/>
In this respect I was very much surprised at a remark which was made by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, to which, to the best of my belief, no reply has yet been made. The noble Viscount said that the policy of a strong and efficient Second Chamber is the taking back of extended political powers given to the people. That seemed to me, my Lords, a very surprising argument, and my answer to it is this. You want a stronger brake on the powerful motor-car of to-day than you wanted on the stage coach of days gone by, and yet by putting a strong brake on a motor-car, a considerably more powerful vehicle than a stage coach, you do not weaken it. The argument of the noble Viscount seemed to me to ignore the fact that the power of the people has been advancing and making progress. Those are the changed circumstances to which I was referring, together with the disappearance of the old Liberal Party and the substitution for it of a coalition of Parties of fundamentally different principles, which have brought about this great disproportion of Parties in your Lordships' House which is at the root of the whole grievance. And that is why this disproportion of Parties would be permanent if the present constitution of this House were to continue as it is.<lb/>
As I said before, the unpopularity of your Lordships' House is not a transient one. I know there are some who pin their faith to the hope that it is merely a passing feeling, and that this House will once more stand exactly the same in the estimation of the nation as it did some years ago. Personally, I cannot believe that the unpopularity is transient. I do not see how it can be, unless the existence of these new Parties, the Radical Party and the Socialist Party, is also transient. On the contrary, they are growing in strength; there can be no denying that, and it seems that a fissiparous tendency is firmly established in the Party which favours more rapid progress or even revolutionary change. The old two-Party system, in my humble opinion, cannot possibly return
<col>354</col>
to re-establish in this House the more or less equal proportion of representatives of the two Parties. Further, my Lords, I maintain that the unpopularity of this House is based on the most persistent and malignant of all human passions, that of jealousy, and that jealousy has been fanned into flame by the campaign of class hatred which has been so persistently and unscrupulously pursued by the friends of noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
There are still further causes for the unpopularity of your Lordships' House. One of them, by no means a negligible one, is that the decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeal are associated with the whole body of your Lordships' House. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack was urging us some time ago to be content with what he called, and rightly called, if I may say so, a noble attribute of this House&#x2014;the fact that your Lordships' House is the highest Court of Appeal in the country. Yet I think there is no denying the fact that it is that very noble attribute which as much as anything else is getting this House into unpopularity. The decision of the noble and learned Lords on such questions as the Taff Vale dispute, or the Church question in Scotland, or the more recent Osborne case, have done, in my humble opinion, as much as anything else to bring this House into unpopularity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00736"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord excuse me? I was not a party to any one of those decisions. It Was my noble and learned friend, my predecessor, who was concerned in those.</membercontribution></p>

I venture to think that if there are to be any changes it is worthy of consideration whether the highest Court of Appeal in the land should not cease to be called the House of Lords, so that there may be no further possibility of any such misunderstanding.<lb/>
I now wish to state, quite briefly, why I desire reform. I desire reform because I wish to disarm that jealousy to which I have referred, and to mitigate that unpopularity. I desire reform because I recognise the validity of the grievance which arises out of the permanent alteration in the balance of the Parties. Since we are governed by a Party system, and since there is no question whatever of altering that system, it seems to me obvious that the permanency of an overwhelming majority of one Party in this House will never find favour with the people at large. It certainly will never find favour with at least half of our fellow countrymen. I think it is incumbent upon those who say they are in favour of reform to indicate at least in principle what they mean. I think I can do so very briefly by saying that I agree in principle with the propositions by which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has explained his Motion. While I agree with the noble Earl that it is vital that historical continuity should be preserved and that the House of Lords should be reformed rather than that a new Second Chamber should be established, I am forced to recognise that no alteration of any kind is possible unless there is some sacrifice of the hereditary principle. Therefore, my Lords, I am willing, after long and anxious consideration, to see the hereditary principle limited, whether it be by qualification, by selection, by nomination, or by a system which embodies all three principles. I think that some such change would be a compromise thoroughly in accordance with the spirit of our laws, our customs, and our institutions, which to the best of my belief have all grown up and been formed by that spirit of compromise.<lb/>
But I am bound to add that I regard it as of supreme importance that the hereditary principle, however it may be limited or qualified, should be kept alive. My reasons for that belief can be stated in
<col>356</col>
a chain of propositions which I will not delay your Lordships by explaining. The argument which impresses me is briefly this. It is a proposition which nobody disputes that our very existence as a nation depends upon the maintenance of the Empire. I imagine that there are very few who would dispute the proposition that the maintenance of the Empire depends upon the maintenance of Monarchy. Personally I cannot for the moment believe that we should be able to preserve the bonds which unite the Mother Country with her Dominions overseas or our peaceful association with the peoples of India if the golden link of the Crown were removed. I have never yet heard any argument to shake my belief that Monarchy cannot exist unless it is supported by an aristocracy, and I think it is self-evident that an aristocracy, to preserve its very existence, must have sufficient political power to enable it to hold its own against the overwhelming majority of the democracy. In brief, then, my Lords, I accept in principle the recommendations of the Committee which was presided over by the noble Earl, but I go a little further and say that we must make some substantial concession to the democratic demand for the elective principle.<lb/>
Let me say that I desire to associate myself most strongly with the plea of my noble friend who opened the debate this afternoon, that this should be treated as a national and not as a Party question. To the best of my belief, we who are advocating reform are taking a step which makes it possible that this should be treated as a national question. What is the object of reform? The object of reform surely is to meet that very Party grievance of noble Lords opposite. Do noble Lords opposite think for one moment that we should have raised this question at all if we had not recognised that they had that grievance, and if we were not animated by a desire, which I claim is a generous desire, to remove that grievance? And yet noble Lords opposite meet us in a bitter Party spirit. We have all been disappointed by the attitude of the noble Earl the Leader of the House. His remarks have been quoted more than once. But I think even more disappointing was the utterance of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey, when he said that no limitation of the powers of this House could be too stringent for the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0204"/>
<col>357</col>
purposes of the Radical Party. I have not got the words here, but to the best of my recollection that is what he said. Anyhow it is substantially what he said, and I think his words show an absolute failure to recognise that there is a national aspect of this question. It is more than disappointing to us that Sir Edward Grey of all people should regard this merely as a question which concerns only the advantage of the Radical Party.<lb/>
Then we had the noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, who displayed the same spirit yesterday when he said, "If you begin to use your power to penalise legislation"&#x2014;that was his view of the situation created by our action with regard to the Budget&#x2014;"you must have your power taken away." It seems to me to be analogous to saying to a man who for forty years has not had occasion to use a fire-arm in self-defence against the assault of a burglar but is obliged to do so in the end, "You have used this power which has been lying dormant for forty years, and therefore we must take it away from you, and if you are ever attacked again you must not defend your life." Of course, the noble Lord supported his argument with the usual diatribe about the arrogant pretensions of this House to control finance, and so forth. It is easy to retort to the noble Lord that the arrogant pretensions, if any there were, were on the side of the House of Commons. The noble Lord seemed to forget that months and months ago the Prime Minister caused it to be understood that the Finance Bill would be used as a weapon against this House and as an instrument for bringing about a constitutional revolution. He also seems to have forgotten the famous utterance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer admitting that the Finance Bill was a trap designed to bring about the fall of this House. I earnestly hope that better counsels will prevail in the Radical Party, and that the friends of noble Lords opposite will see that those of us who favour reform do seriously wish to meet their grievance. And to noble Lords on this side of the House I would say, with all deference and submission, that if we are going to do anything at all, if we are going to convince our political opponents that we do wish to remedy their grievance, that we do wish to remove friction, that we are anxious to bring about national unity, whatever we do must be a substantial concession, not to
<col>358</col>
democracy&#x2014;for I deny absolutely that the Radical Party represents the democracy or the people of this country; it represents at most only one half of the people of the country&#x2014;but a concession to that half of the nation who are in such bitter disagreement with us on this important and anxious question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00742"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the hour is getting late and this debate has been considerably protracted, I hope to earn the gratitude of your Lordships by compressing the few remarks that I have to make into the smallest possible compass. The first thing I wish to do is to express my gratitude to the noble Earl on the Cross Benches for making this Motion. I concur entirely in the propriety of the remark which he made that he possibly was one of the best persons to make this Motion, because he sits upon the Cross Benches, and that the introduction of a discussion of this kind could be made and conducted with more propriety and with less Party feeling if it were started by him rather than by any of those who sit on the two Front Benches. I heartily concur with, and shall gladly support, the Motion to go into Committee, because I think that it is absolutely necessary to agree to that Motion. I think the very least everyone can do who has any real desire for reform and who does not look upon the constitution of this House at the present moment as absolutely perfect, is to agree to this Motion with the intention subsequently of discussing the Resolutions which the noble Earl says he is going to bring forward.<lb/>
I do not intend to detain your Lordships by enlarging or giving the reasons why I am in favour of reform. I am one of those who have been in favour of reform for a long time, although, of course, I have seen all its difficulties; and Lord Curzon, I thought, spoke very appropriately when he said that reform of this House must be a matter of long time and could not be started unless there was some propelling force behind it. The time, I think, has come, and I quite concur that the noble Earl has embraced the first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity, which has offered of bringing the matter before the House in order that this House may, if it sees fit, reform itself and initiate changes without waiting for what comes from the other House. Our task, then, at least as I
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0205"/>
<col>359</col>
regard it, is how are we to provide the best possible Second Chamber for the country as a whole, and without any reference to Party or persons. That is the way in which I regard it, and at the same time&#x2014;though I speak for myself only, of course&#x2014;I am sure that I am expressing the opinions of a great many of your Lordships when I say that personal privileges and prerogatives and matters of that sort ought not in any way to influence our judgment. Certainly I hope they do not influence mine. I am perfectly ready to cease to be a member of your Lordships' House, but on this condition only, that I see a Second Chamber substituted for this Chamber which is a real Chamber&#x2014;no sham, no mere registry office, but a Chamber which is so constituted as to be likely to act for the benefit of the nation as a whole.<lb/>
Let me say at once with regard to the hereditary principle, which is always the first matter that comes up, that I contend that this House, constituted upon the hereditary principle, has done its work well. If you take the history of the last twenty years, where there has ever been a difference between the two Houses, the nation, when it has been called upon to pronounce, has pronounced on your Lordships' side and not on the side of the House of Commons, I even go so far as to say that the action of this House in regard to the Finance Bill, which your Lordships suspended last year, has been proved to be right. I am perfectly well aware that noble Lords opposite who maintain the contrary say that the present deadlock which exists is owing entirely to the action of your Lordships. One of the things which strikes me so much in this Government is their power of looking past all facts which are not convenient to them. In regard to this matter the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and the noble Earl who leads the House made speeches, but I should never have known, no one would ever have known, from either of those speeches that there had been a General Election, or that there were such persons as electors in this country. Pray, why has such a change come over the House of Commons? Did your Lordships make that change? Your Lordships merely stated that you yourselves considered that the Finance Bill contained in it a number of provisions of which you could not approve, and which you did not feel sure that the country would approve. The result was a General Election. What happened?
<col>360</col>
Are you responsible for what the electors did? And when we are told that this deadlock exists and that it is all our fault, I say put it down to the right cause&#x2014;put it down to the action of the electors. The Finance Bill last year was read a third time in the House of Commons by 379 to 149. Can you do that now? If you cannot, pray by whose action is it that you are unable to do it? Is it not by the action of the electors? How can it in any way be attributed to this House? I leave that subject.<lb/>
When you come to discuss this hereditary principle from the point of view of logic, I frankly admit I do not think you can defend it. The hereditary principle exposes us to all sorts of remarks in the country. Every Radical orator, and every Radical who feels possibly some want of confidence in his opinion about other things, feels certain about one thing at all events&#x2014;that he knows and understands all about this House; and there is a confusion about coronets and gilded chambers and nonsense of that sort, which your Lordships know well form a large part of the stock-in-trade of orators on Radical platforms. We in this House know how absurd all that is. But there it is. It is perfectly true you may say those sort of things about this House, and therefore from the point of view of advantage of this House it appears to me that we ought to do anything that we can to put a stop to and prevent arguments of that kind. Then the enemies of a Second Chamber&#x2014;and this is the point where I think the hereditary principle hurts this House&#x2014;appeal to the defects of the constitution of this House as an argument which they apply to the disadvantage of a Second Chamber at all. They argue that because your Lordships are hereditary, therefore a Second Chamber has no right to have any powers&#x2014;indeed, they go further.<lb/>
This House is unfortunate in another particular. It is unfortunate in its title as a Second Chamber because of the word "Lords." We know that the mere word "Lords" can be made the occasion, and is made the occasion, of saying all kinds of things which are unflattering to the Second Chamber. Then with regard to another point which was taken just now by the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill. He said&#x2014;and the Duke of Northumberland called attention to it also last night&#x2014;that the fact that the judgments which are pronounced by by the House of Lords sitting as the highest
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0206"/>
<col>361</col>
Court of Appeal are constantly accepted by large bodies of persons in the country as being the action of this House sitting as a whole has added to the unpopularity of your Lordships' House. I need not point out that if you can only change the term by which the highest Court of Appeal is known, at all events you will take away one of the causes which exists of raising unfounded objections against this House.<lb/>
Now with regard to a Second Chamber. There are no fewer than three parties with three different opinions with regard to a Second Chamber. I am speaking now of the various sections of the Liberal Party. First of all, there are the Labour Members. They would end this House altogether, for they are entirely opposed to a Second Chamber of any sort or kind. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in a speech the other day, said that a Second Chamber is inconsistent with democratic responsibility; and he said, further&#x2014;
<quote>"I am in favour of the abolition of the House of Lords, but if I cannot get abolition then I will take the Veto, because that is the second best. Let us take away the Veto; let the Peers stay where they are; give them no power, but keep them as decoration."</quote>
I respect the Labour Members for the frankness with which they always speak. I always understand what they mean. I own I find great difficulty at times in understanding the meaning of the Government. But there is no doubt about the meaning of the Labour Members.<lb/>
What is the view of the Cabinet? It appears to me that what Mr. Ramsay Macdonald said very frankly and openly&#x2014;"Keep them as decorations, but give them no powers"&#x2014;is the view of the Cabinet. The Cabinet seem to me to be united against one thing, and that is against having a real Second Chamber possessing powers. I heard Lord Marchamley say just now that he thought a Statute ought to be passed to prevent your Lordships from stopping Liberal Bills. But why Liberal Bills only? Then, again, Mr. Asquith himself has spoken quite openly on this matter; at least, I thought it was open. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I myself am in favour of a Second Chamber. I see much practical advantage that may arise from the existence aide by side with the House of Commons of a body, not indeed of co-ordinate authority, but suitable in numbers and by its composition to exercise impartially in regard to our general legislation the powers of revision, amendment, fuller deliberation, and, subject to proper safeguards, of delay. We are not pro-
<col>362</col>
posing the setting up of a single Chamber. We are going to ask the electors that the House of Lords shall be confined to the proper functions of a Second Chamber. The absolute Veto of a Second Chamber must be abolished."</quote>
My Lords, that is a cloud of words, but what is the only meaning of it? It means that the Second Chamber is to have no power, and Mr. Lloyd-George spoke very much in the same way, only rather more fully. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"This Cabinet is determined not to hold office unless full powers are accorded to it to pass Liberal and Progressive measures in the course of a single Parliament, either with or without the sanction of the House of Lords. That does not mean a single Chamber, but it does mean that if and when there is a conflict between the two Houses and the House of Lords persists in resistance after full opportunities are afforded to both Houses for reflection, then in the course of a single Parliament the will of the House which represents the people must and shall prevail."</quote>
What is that except a single Chamber? Indeed, I do not know that I can adduce any stronger evidence against the wisdom and propriety of the proposal of the Government than that afforded by Sir Edward Grey. We were told just now that Sir Edward Grey's brain was like a cold-storage chamber, from which ideas issued in a refrigerated form, or something of that kind. He is so very cool and so very calculating that he seldom says anything. It is hardly possible, we were told, to get anything out of him at all, he is so reticent and so cautious. But what does he say? He says&#x2014;
<quote>"I say that to confine ourselves to a single Chamber issue would result for us, politically speaking, in disaster, death, and damnation."</quote>
Well, my Lords, this comes from a person whose brain is like a cold-storage chamber. I wonder if he had been a little more like ourselves what language he would have used. I should have said myself that there was a certain amount of strength about those expressions which he used. But having thus disposed of the proposal which, as I understand, is going to be submitted to this House, though why in the world the Veto and the Reform of this House cannot be treated together passes my wits, Sir Edward Grey says&#x2014;
<quote>"As far as the House of Lords as at present constituted is concerned, no limitation of its powers can be too stringent."</quote>
What for? For the general good? No. For the needs of Liberal policy. That is exactly what Lord Marchamley said&#x2014;that a Statute ought to be passed to prevent your Lordships from interfering
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0207"/>
<col>363</col>
with Liberal Bills. That is the question, Sir Edward Grey says, at the moment for this Parliament. He goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"But remember that the limitation must be regarded, in my opinion, as preparatory to, and without prejudice to, a full consideration of what should be the proper constitution of a Second Chamber, and what powers should be allowed to a Second Chamber so constituted."</quote>
He proposes, in the first place, that your constitution should be abolished and your Lordships' power, and then he and his colleagues would proceed to create a new Second Chamber, and to decide what powers it was to have. Surely those words will bear only one interpretation&#x2014;that the present Government or the present House of Commons is not only going to destroy the present constitution of the Second Chamber, but absolutely to create a new Second Chamber according to its own wishes, and to suit its own purposes. At all events, that has not happened yet, and I think that some time will elapse before it does happen.<lb/>
The Secretary of State for India the other night showed us quite clearly what his intention is. He said he would do nothing to strengthen this Chamber. He indicated very clearly that it is his desire to weaken it. The greatest difficulty in carrying out his desire is that I do not see how this Chamber can be weakened unless you take away its powers altogether. May I ask your Lordships, if you take away the legislative powers from this House what powers has it got left? I am not aware of one. I should be very glad if the noble Earl, when he is speaking to-morrow night, would tell us what powers he is going to leave to this House when he has taken away all its legislative powers. We have heard of revision, consideration, and things of that sort, but all that is the province, as Lord Newton said last night, of a debating society; it is not the primary object of a Second Chamber.<lb/>
My Lords, I have said quite enough for the purposes of to-night. We shall have a good many opportunities, I have no doubt, for discussing this matter both in Committee and hereafter, when, as I hope, it will take the form of a Bill. But in the meantime I entirely concur in one remark&#x2014;I think it was the only remark of Lord Morley's with which I did concur&#x2014;that your Lordships' constitution is a matter of comparatively secondary importance,
<col>364</col>
and that what is of importance, not to your Lordships but to the Second Chamber of this country, is its powers. Those powers are at this moment very small indeed. You cannot find a Second Chamber belonging to any other nation which has powers so small; and I venture to hope&#x2014;certainly I myself in my humble way shall do my best when these matters are discussed to ensure it&#x2014;that at all events such powers as we have are neither taken away from us nor in any way diminished.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00743"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, some noble Lords have given this House the benefit of their reminiscences of Oliver Cromwell. I wondered why none of them reminded the House that Oliver Cromwell, though a staunch Nonconformist, was also a brewer, and that he would certainly have voted against the Budget and the Licensing Bill had he been a member of last year's House of Commons. The Long Parliament in 1640 consisted of about 500 Members; yet in February, 1649, when only about fourteen months older than an ordinary Septennial Parliament, there were only seventy-three Members present at the Division which abolished the House of Lords by forty-four to twenty-nine. The greater part of the absentees had been expelled from the House from time to time, or were afraid to be in London while the House was in a murderous mood. The same thing might happen again if there was no other institution which could insist on an appeal to the people. That Parliament had the unenviable distinction of re-establishing slavery in England. With all its talk of freedom, it sold thousands of freeborn Englishmen as slaves to the West Indies. After the battle of Worcester, in 1500, Englishmen were sold as slaves to the Coast of Guinea, the white man's grave. Its tyranny was ten thousand times worse than that of Charles the First, yet when it first sat its intentions were excellent.<lb/>
In Greece at the present moment a single Chamber has to render obedience to a group of mutinous soldiery, though there are hopes that the Greeks may regain their freedom if a counter revolution can be organised by the Navy. I think that Servia may also be looked upon as a single-Chamber country. Its Council of sixteen is not the equivalent of a second Chamber. Its methods of dealing with a recent constitutional crisis are, it is hoped, not
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0208"/>
<col>365</col>
likely to be adopted by any other country. I do not wish to repeat historical statements already made by other noble Lords, but I think that I can safely say that this debate has shown that single Chambers have always led to unfortunate results that were never contemplated by the kings and peoples who established them. As there were no legal means of getting rid of single Chambers violence was the only remedy available. The tyranny of one man was preferable to the tyranny of the many, and the news of the dispersal of a single Chamber was generally received with delight by the people most interested. If once a single Chamber is established in England, I feel certain that before ten years have elapsed it will either be dispersed by an indignant mob or by the troops of a foreign invader. Human nature being what it is, single Chambers require an outside power to protect them against themselves.<lb/>
It is well to look round and to consider the reasons that have brought the question of the Veto of the House of Lords into practical politics. There is a Budget that is said to be dead by some people, because the Government, notwithstanding all their threats, have not as yet dared to bring it before a newly-elected House of Commons, and there is a Home Rule question that was thought to have been killed by the General Election of 1895. These two political corpses are by an unhallowed union, certainly not one of affection, to be brought into contact with one another and galvanised into political life, and to be transformed into living laws, which are to be imposed on people who have already shown by their votes at the last Election that, if consulted, they would refuse to pass both these measures if put before them in a straightforward and simple manner. The referendum is the only means by which the people can be saved from the tyrannies and usurpations of a single Chamber. The House of Lords as it stands is not strong enough to do this. If considerably strengthened by being made elective it will be perpetually over-ruling
<col>366</col>
the Commons, and there will be no convenient method of deciding their disputes any more than there is now. Automatically the Referendum would give that redistribution of power according to population that the country is so much in want of, and redress many of the injustices of the single seat system.<lb/>
It takes three wagon loads of Romford voters to equal the vote of an Irish peasant at Kilkenny, but when a Referendum takes place the voter at Romford will feel that he has the same weight and importance as a voter at Kilkenny, and the large minorities of Irishmen and Welshmen who are now unrepresented, who have not even spokesmen to represent their views in the House of Commons, will find themselves restored to political life by a Referendum in which every vote will have the same value. The Referendum has been tried with success in the Anglo-Saxon community of Natal, and there is no reason why it should not be tried here. It would restore to the people much of the power that the House of Commons has deprived them of. It is not my intention to recapitulate the reasons that have been given for the reform of this House by other Peers. I rose chiefly with the intention of pointing out that the resort to a Referendum when the Houses disagree is a possible refuge from the despotism of a single Chamber and a democratic solution of the difficulties amidst which the country now finds itself.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00774"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will probably wish for one or two words of explanation with regard to this Bill. As your Lordships are no doubt aware, ancient monuments are regulated by two Acts of Parliament. The first, which was passed in 1882, empowered the Commissioners of Works to purchase and accept as gifts or by bequest monuments specified in the schedule of the Act. These were mainly prehistoric works and did not include buildings of an historic character. The Act of 1882 was amended in 1900, when the Commissioners were enabled to accept as gifts or to purchase monuments of historical or national interest, but they were not given the power to accept any such monuments by bequest. At the present moment a gentleman who shall be nameless, who is possessed of one of the finest national and historical monuments in this country, desires to bequeath it to the State, but as the law at present stands the Commissioners are not allowed to accept such a bequest. Hence the necessity for this Bill. I feel it is unnecessary for me to say anything more, and I leave the Bill in your Lordships' hands with every confidence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00779"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it may be of interest to the noble Lord and to the House if I state very briefly what occurred with regard to the use of the referendum in Natal. The draft Union Constitution was accepted by the other South African Colonies by Parliamentary Resolution, but at quite an early stage of the discussion the Natal Government promised that it should be submitted to the votes of the electors of Natal for acceptance or rejection. Therefore an Act was passed last April to enable the referendum to be taken; that Act was assented to by the Governor, and the Royal Assent was not withheld. It provided that a ballot should be taken after due notice, the electors being required to vote "Yes" or "No" on the question,"Are you in favour of the draft South African Act?" Any person who was qualified to vote in an election for the Legislative Chamber might vote once in any district in which he was registered. The ballot was held on June 10, and 11,121 voted "Yes" and 3,701 voted "No,"
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0211"/>
<col>371</col>
thus giving a majority of 7,420 for the Union. The number of electors who recorded their votes was 14,821, and the total number of electors registered in 1908 was 25,463. At the last General Election in 1906 15,152 voted. The noble Lord will see that the vote on the referendum was only slightly less than the vote at the previous General Election. I shall be glad to lay on the Table Papers embodying these facts.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00780">Debate on the Motion, That the House do resolve itself into a Committee to consider the best means of reforming its existing organisation so as to constitute a strong and efficient Second Chamber, <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00781"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there was an observation made last evening by the noble and learned Earl who spoke from the Front Opposition Bench (Lord Halsbury) with which I felt great sympathy. He said he experienced much difficulty in this discussion in the absence of a concrete scheme, and consequently did not feel that he could deal with the subject with any practical efficiency. I have felt that greatly throughout this debate, and when my noble and learned friend went on to say that he proposed to vote in favour of going into Committee I confess I thought that as that last shadow of apparent opposition to the Motion before your Lordships had been removed, we could almost dispense with these proceedings and go to the next stage.<lb/>
The discussion has necessarily been rather academic, and we might get to realities in Committee. A little reflection, however, has led me to think that that is a rash conclusion. We are not yet prepared to consider the matter in a real practical fashion in Committee. I see it suggested in some newspapers that we may go into Committee on Monday. The first, the second, and even the third Resolution may be passed, but the crux of this business lies in the way of dealing with the question in a practical manner, and we are not at all advanced, so far as I can see, with any suggestions which at the present moment could be accepted as practicable or could be put into operation. We are therefore just entering on the study of this great question, we are making pre-
<col>372</col>
parations, we are providing contributions for discussion, and we are doing very little more. What is the question which lies at the root of this debate and was the origin of the Select Committee of two or three years ago? It is the sense of the growing divergency between the two properly co-operative parts of Parliament. They ought to work together; at one time they did work together in a fashion, and of course they do work together in some fashion still; but the difficulty of working together has of late years been very considerable.<lb/>
I do not impute blame to any person or Party. It has arisen, probably, from the natural development of things. But it has come about that what I may call the plane of movement and life in this House is entirely different from that of members of the other House. The line of intersection of practical action grows more and more difficult to reach, and it is that which is driving people to consider how the difficulty of arriving at co-operation between the two branches of the. Legislature can be overcome. We are driven to the consideration of that problem. It may be difficult for some of your Lordships to appreciate the sense of separateness which attaches to the proceedings of your Lordships' House. Perhaps you will forgive me for expressing the impressions of one who came here after a more or less busy life of twenty-four years spent elsewhere. One seems to come into the presence of a land-locked pool, a place which storms cannot reach, so bounded by breakwaters, natural and historical, that the ordinary tides of life scarcely break in upon it.<lb/>
I know, of course, that many of your Lordships in your earlier years have been brought into closer contact with multitudes of men. Some of you have even special means of information as to what is the development of opinion elsewhere, but any one who watches from within the progress of your debates and who tries to enter into sympathy with the movement of the mind of this place must feel how much estranged it is from the movement of mind elsewhere. There are whole classes and more than classes of His Majesty's subjects leading lives and enduring experiences that can scarcely be appreciated in this Assembly. No voice from them reaches your Lordships except at secondhand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00782"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>

<col>373</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00783"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: Can it be denied that there is no one to speak from experience of the way in which half the population of these islands live? You can speak, of course, from a certain degree of intercourse with them. I am not imputing blame in any way, but that is one of the defects of this Assembly which has led to the difficulties of legislation with which we are confronted. No wonder that, under those circumstances, there should arise, on the part of the Liberal Party especially, a sense of the immovability and inaccessibility of your Lordships' House which causes them to question whether means could not be developed for securing some effectual result to their desires, even if those desires may not meet at once with your Lordships' appreciation and approval.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Marchamley spoke last night in a very powerful way of the experience of the Liberal Party, with whose fortunes he has been intimately connected, with regard to schemes which found a large measure of favour elsewhere but were negatived in this House. It was no wonder that, when the great election of 1906 happened, and the majority returned at that election found that projects of legislation sent up to this House were set aside one after another, the thought should have arisen whether this obstacle could not be overcome. The Resolution which went by the name of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was submitted to the other House and approved by a large majority, sketching out a plan for overcoming the difficulty which I have endeavoured to put before your Lordships. It was called the Campbell-Bannerman Resolution, but I believe that, as a matter of fact, the original suggestion came from the late Mr. Bright. The plan which he originated, and which in some measure is now before us, was a somewhat rude and crude suggestion. I doubt whether it could stand by itself. I am not sure whether it is intended to stand by itself.<lb/>
If I am thought to be disrespectful in so describing this suggestion, let me recall that Lord Marchamley has confessed that he disapproved of the suggestion as a solution from the first, although he was Chief Whip of the Liberal Party at the time it was brought forward. I confess that I find great difficulty in reconciling the suggestion, if it is to be taken absolutely and nakedly by itself, with the language
<col>374</col>
and attitude of some of His Majesty's Ministers at this moment. I am not so much alarmed about the suggestion as some members of your Lordships' House appear to be. It strikes me, indeed, as a little inconsistent that one should hear it denounced as involving perils to the character of the Legislature, and then to be at once told that it is impossible to adopt it, and that, if it were adopted, it would be repudiated and set aside again immediately after its adoption. If those conclusions are right, then I confess that the terrors excited by the suggestion are to my mind a little overstrained, and, if I might venture on the epithet, I would say that the alarms and anxieties expressed are somewhat inartistic, that they are quite beyond what is necessary or appropriate to the occasion. I do not look upon the suggestion as final. It is a contribution to the settlement of the fundamental question of reconciling in some way the character of the two Houses, and I accept it as a suggestion and as not very much more.<lb/>
There are other ways of overcoming the difficulty to which I have called attention. In former generations, as I have said, the disaccord was not so great, not so pressing as it has been of late years, and the disaccord might be abated by some development, of the composition of your Lordships' House such as is involved in the recommendations of the Select Committee, and, still more, in the suggestions which were considered, but not adopted, by that Select Committee. And, again, the disaccord may be abated by some movement elsewhere bringing the disparity and divergence between the two branches of the Legislature within a range that really admitted of practical treatment.<lb/>
We are concerned here with the composition of this House, but I shall not scruple myself to make a slight reference in passing to the other branch of the Legislature. The difficulty arises because the House of Lords deals sometimes summarily, too often in a very unfriendly way, with the legislation that comes to it from another place. When I look down the passage which separates the two Houses I sometimes think that if, indeed, we were convinced that there was sitting at the end of it the true council of the nation, we should wait upon its conclusions with
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0213"/>
<col>375</col>
much attention. But one of the causes of the divergence with which I have been dealing, one which we cannot overlook, arises from the growing conviction which is pressed upon all men of the inconclusive Authority which attaches from time to time to the Resolutions adopted elsewhere. When we have got great elements absent there, as great elements are absent from your Lordships' House, when the representation of those which are represented is distorted, and when, moreover, the final conclusion is unsteady, untrustworthy, and liable to be negatived after a very short interval, we cannot attach to the conclusions so adopted that peremptory authority which requires their being sanctioned at once when brought to your Lordships' House. It is admitted on all hands that there must be some scope of attention, of discussion, of delay, something to be got over, from time to time, before such conclusions are finally ratified.<lb/>
Will your Lordships allow me, before I pass from this subject, to mention two little facts of arithmetic which seem to me to have a very considerable bearing upon the question of authority to be attributed elsewhere? Your Lordships have seen the figures of the late General Election, and I am not going to enter into any examination of their total or into any comparison, but I am going to ask your Lordships to consider this simple aspect of them. The majority elsewhere&#x2014;not, perhaps, the Ministerial majority, but the majority against your Lordships, to put it bluntly&#x2014;is 122. If you picked out from the last General Election the sixty-one or sixty-two seats won with the least majorities by supporters of the Ministry and added those majorities together, you would find this result, that by shifting 8,000 voters from the Liberal ranks to the Conservative ranks the whole of that majority of 122 would be wiped out. You may look upon that as very encouraging to some of your Lordships who would like to have another fight soon, perhaps to get those 8,000 and wipe the majority out. But let me add another fact. If you took the same number of seats won by similar majorities returning Conservative Members, and added those majorities, you would find again that the transfer of less than 8,000 voters from the Conservative to the Liberal side would double the majority of the Ministry. With those facts in your mind, I think it would be impossible to attribute
<col>376</col>
that permanence of authority and abiding character to the decisions elsewhere which are really wanted to give them force. There remains with me the conviction that there lies, perhaps, the greatest defect in our representative system.<lb/>
I pass away from that to what is more immediately before us. The discrepancy in the two Houses may necessarily lead to legislation to bring about a solution of the differences between them, or it may be amended by an alteration in the character of the two Houses, so as to bring them more in accord with one another. The subject on which we have been engaged for two or three nights, and the subject of the Select Committee's consideration and Report, was really the amendment of the character of this House so as to bring it, if not more in accord with the other House, more in accord with the main elements of the national will, to give it more authority, and to make it an element which would work more easily in conjunction with the other branch of the Legislature. To reform this House is to increase its authority. You, my Lords, have increased your authority in recent years. No observer of public life can avoid acknowledging the conclusion&#x2014;it may be distasteful or it may not&#x2014;that the authority, not the power, of your Lordships' House has certainly increased in recent years. I am persuaded that if you went on to amend the composition of the House along the lines suggested by the Select Committee you would tend not only to remove the divergence between the two Houses, but to increase not the power but the authority of the House of Lords.<lb/>
When the Select Committee was appointed there was a refusal on the part of His Majesty's Government to take any part in its deliberations. I do not at all complain of that refusal. I think it was not only intelligible but was absolutely justifiable. It was quite their proper line of action to take. They had enough in their hands in relation to the work in which they were engaged, and could not embarrass their own political task by entering into discussions in a Committee of your Lordships' House in which their supporters would be largely out-numbered. But I felt at the same time that there was no reason why independent followers of His Majesty's Government should not join in the Committee's deliberations. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches, in his speech on Monday,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0214"/>
<col>377</col>
spoke as if some courage was exhibited by the three of us&#x2014;my lamented friend Lord Selby, my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale, and myself&#x2014;who joined in the deliberations of the Committee. I am not conscious of any particular bravery in that transaction, and I believe His Majesty's Government approved of our co-operating in the discussion of this great question.<lb/>
The work of the Committee may be roughly described as an attempt to bring this House a little more into contact with the actual life of to-day, by bringing in elements that are not at present in it and diminishing that overweight of authority and prescriptive right with which your Lordships are now really embarrassed. I think the Committee entered upon their work in a really workmanlike and businesslike spirit. My noble friend below me (Viscount Morley) made a peroration to his speech by quoting some sentences of his own from his work on Cromwell. I may say in passing that I felt how much easier it is to get near the central truth of things in writing a book than in making a political speech. My noble friend did get near the truth when he said that to call out of empty space an artificial House, without the hold upon men's minds of history and ancient association, without defined powers, without marked distinction of persons or interests, and then to try to make it into an effective screen against an elected House, to whose assent it owed its own being, was not to promote union but directly to promote division and to intensify it.<lb/>
I must confess at once that, recognising the maxims laid down by my noble friend, I put wholly out of consideration any scheme of absolute reconstruction of this Chamber, or creating a perfectly new Second Chamber, and of substituting for it something quite unlike it which I find bruited about in certain journals and among some of my friends. That is not a scheme of action which pursues historic tradition or is imbued by the spirit of past association. I do not think it would be a scheme of action which would really be in accordance with the prevailing modes of thought and ideas of this nation and country.<lb/>
The emergency does not demand such a policy, and it could not be accomplished. We must proceed in a slower fashion. But if we do not want revolution we do want something, and in my view the result of the
<col>378</col>
Committee's labours was not adequate to the necessities of the situation. We do not want a complete change, but we want something more of a change than the Committee were able to agree upon. Their recommendations were inadequate and inconclusive. There were other suggestions which might have received support from a Committee representing the whole of your Lordships, but this Committee was composed mainly of noble Lords from the other side of the House.<lb/>
The Committee felt that the numbers of this House were too large, but they did not venture to suggest what the limitation should be. When practical action comes to be adopted it will have to be laid down at starting that the number of the working body of Peers in future should be certainly under 300, and as little above 200 as can conveniently be managed. But if you adopt that as a maximum it follows that the notion of having 200 elected members from, the body of Peers at large is egregiously exaggerated. It is much too large a number. You cannot form a House of 250 members which shall contain within it those new representatives you desire to introduce, and retain within it 200 elected members of this House. With some hesitation I suggest that a number more like eighty would be an adequate contribution from the body of Peers to the composition of the Lords of Parliament. If you started with a maximum of 250, that proportion would give great, but not too great, power to the selected Peers, and it would be enough also to satisfy all reasonable claims.<lb/>
I think the Committee were too liberal in their range of the qualifications to be possessed by Peers selected for membership of the Second Chamber. No doubt there are certain offices of weight and authority the holders of which are <i>prima facie</i> extremely well qualified to assist in the deliberations of the House; but I think that in their list of qualifications the Committee descended too much into details. On the other hand, I think the Committee might have been more liberal in the matter of life Peerages. To trust to the good sense of the Minister in the selection, or to require some declaration on his part that he would select on the ground of fitness by reason of experience or service, would be much better than to attempt to tie the Minister down by drawing up a list of specified qualifications.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0215"/>
<col>379</col>
But the real crux of the matter lies in the answer to the question&#x2014;How are you going to define those persons who are to come in from the outside and in what fashion are they to enter? On that point the Committee were pretty evenly divided. In my opinion, until we get some distinct proposition from one side or the other put forward with authority, as to the definition of the persons to be brought in from the outside, we may go into Committee of the Whole House on the Resolutions and yet have gone but a very little way towards a solution of the difficulty. It is suggested that there should be a grouping of county councils and county borough councils who should be entitled to send a Peer to the House for every quarter of a million or half a million of the population. But that proposition involves a difficulty which I should like to avoid&#x2014;that is, the carving out of new constituencies and the bringing together for the election of Peers persons who had been chosen for purposes entirely different.<lb/>
There was a third solution laid before the Select Committee which would certainly bring into the House a new and vital element and at the same time would avoid these difficulties of election and the parcelling out of fresh constituencies. It was suggested by Viscount St. Aldwyn that at the commencement of every Parliament the House of Commons should be entitled to address the Crown to appoint, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, eighty Peers as an addition to the House of Lords. These eighty Peers were to be chosen from different parts of the United Kingdom, and to represent all the great spheres of commerce and manufacture, labour as well as capital, working men as well as employers, and it was well said that a House of Lords containing these elements would command respect and ensure sympathy, for it would have within it representatives of every form of activity and energy throughout the kingdom. That proposition was lost by only seven votes to eleven. In my opinion it is somewhat on that line we shall have to proceed when the question of reform comes really before us. At the same time the suggestion is open to obvious objections. For one thing, you would have to entrust a great deal to the discretion, capacity, and public spirit of the Prime Minister in the selection of the eighty Peers, and it might be difficult to ensure that his selections would realise
<col>380</col>
the ideal of the noble Viscount who made the suggestion.<lb/>
I venture to make another suggestion. It is not my own suggestion, but a suggestion that was derived by putting together the thoughts of two or three friends with whom I have discussed the matter. It is that at the commencement of every Parliament the House of Commons should be entitled to nominate fifty persons to sit in the Second Chamber, who would be chosen by the method of proportional representation, so that every section of opinion in the House of Commons should have its proper share. These fifty persons so selected should be recommended to the Crown to be summoned as Peers to sit for two Parliaments. If that were done you would have 100 Members in the second and subsequent Parliaments, for fifty would be nominated at the commencement of each Parliament. The nomination of these fifty persons would work out at something like one person for every thirteen members of the House of Commons. Under such a system, in the case of the present Parliament, the thirty-nine Labour Members in the House of Commons would be able to send three persons to the Second Chamber; the Nationalists would be able to send seven; the Ministerialists twenty; and the Opposition twenty. But if the system were in operation at the commencement of the last Parliament, the disposition of the fifty would be different because the last House of Commons was composed differently from the present. You would, in fact, have had thirty Ministerialists, ten members of the Opposition, seven Nationalists, and three Labour Members; and, putting the two together, you would have had serving in this Parliament, fifty Ministerialists, thirty supporters of the Opposition, thirteen Nationalists, and six or seven Labour Members, making up 100. In that way you would have a representation of every part of the country, and a representation of Labour and Capital. If we had such a composition as that the authority of this House would be greatly developed, and the weight attached to its co-operation would be immensely increased. The scheme which I have outlined involves no creation of constituencies; and you would not have to call persons to act together who were not accustomed to act together. The county councils have been chosen for
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0216"/>
<col>381</col>
totally different purposes, and, if they were made the elective bodies, their election in future might be affected by the fact that they would be called upon to perform this duty. They would be free from that.<lb/>
My Lords, I have nearly done, but I should like to add one thing more. I have not overlooked the fact that some solution of what is called the deadlock must be in some way devised. If we had got this Assembly reconstructed in the fashion I have suggested there would at least be open to us the mode of settling differences between the two Houses which is familiar to the Colonial Secretary, since it is found in our latest colonial Constitution&#x2014;the mode which is familiar to students of other Parliaments&#x2014;that of bringing on critical occasions the two branches of the Legislature together to vote on the question at issue. If the House of Lords were recast in the fashion I have suggested, keeping up, as it would largely, its connection with the past, you would be able to avoid that crude and rude, and rough and ready way of overbearing one House by the simple authority of the other, by bringing them together and letting the majority of both determine what should be done. It could not be done now, because the majority of your Lordships' House is so overwhelmingly on one side as to repel the suggestion at once, but if this House were recast and reduced the scheme might be put into force. It may be that some other mode will have to be adopted. At all events, I have submitted to you my own thoughts, and I hope that, whatever happens, some solution will be arrived at which will make this and the other House long continue to co-operate as branches of the Legislature&#x2014;something which shall enable them in the future to maintain the pride that they have had in the past in the working of our Constitution, something that shall make them perhaps feel that it is not altogether a mockery when they are asked to join in the petition for increasing, maintaining, and preserving the efficiency of the great council of the nation now assembled in Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

House. I have followed the debate as carefully as I was able, and I have not detected in the speeches which have been delivered any note of dissent either from his Motion that we should go into Committee, or, indeed, I think, to certainly two out of the three Resolutions which he has put upon the Paper. After hearing my noble and learned friend (Lord Halsbury) say last night that he did not intend to raise any objection to my noble friend's Motion, I think we may take it for granted that up to that point at all events the way is clear.<lb/>
And I confess that I can scarcely myself conceive a frame of mind in any member of the House which would make him go to the length of voting against the Motion of my noble friend on the Cross Benches. To vote against that Motion would really be equivalent to a declaration that the person who so voted believed that we could dispense with a strong and efficient Second Chamber; and that your Lordships' House, as we know it at present, is so perfectly constituted as to be incapable of any improvement of any kind. However devoted your Lordships may be to the service of this House, I can scarcely imagine that any of you will go to the length of affirming those two propositions.<lb/>
I would myself go rather further and say that everything that has lately happened&#x2014;every incident in the political life of this country, almost every speech that is delivered&#x2014;goes to show how essential it is that we should in this country have a Chamber which is strong and efficient. Have we not been told within the last few days that owing to the temper of the other House of Parliament it is impossible to arrive at a reasonable adjustment of the financial difficulties which we are at present encountering? Have we not been told that there is a state of war between the two Houses&#x2014;a state of war precluding the kind of reasonable accommodation to which, but for that state of war, we might have looked forward? And only in the debate last night a remarkable statement was made to the House by no less an authority than the late Whip of the Liberal Party&#x2014;the noble Lord opposite, Lord Marchamley. What had the noble Lord to tell us? Some one had, I think, referred to the existence of the conscience of the Whips. The noble Lord was here last night to tell us that there was no such thing as the conscience of a Whip.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00788"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am content to leave the matter there. Now, my Lords, at this particular moment, this uncompromising organisation is to dictate that the Constitution of this country is to be pulled to pieces; under its dictation, a Legislative Chamber which is already, according to the Secretary of State for India, virtually all-powerful, a Chamber which is more easily swayed by political passion than your Lordships' House, is to order not only that the Constitution is to be fundamentally altered, but that, as the most rev. Primate pointed out to us the other night, for the first time in the history of this country, the functions of Parliament are to be modified by Statute. And this use of the power of the House of Commons is to take place at a moment when the Government of the day has just received at the hands of the electorate of the country a slap in the face which I take it many Governments have not experienced in the course of our political history; and all this is to happen at the instance of the majority&#x2014;I think my noble and learned friend (Lord Halsbury) would call it a sort of a majority&#x2014;which was so mercilessly analysed by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, which was also severely dissected by the noble Lord to whom we have just listened, and which is of such a precarious character that His Majesty's Government do not dare to put their forces in the field, and probably will not venture to put them in the field unless the arts practised by the successors of the noble Lord opposite are freely applied. All these things seem to go
<col>384</col>
far to justify my noble friend on the Cross Benches in his desire that this country should be provided with a strong and efficient Second Chamber.<lb/>
May I, although reluctantly, say one word with regard to my own attitude towards this question? I cannot pretend to have worked in the field of House of Lords reform as long as the noble Earl or as long as some of my noble friends behind me; but, at any rate, this is no death-bed repentance on my part. I was a member of the Committee presided over by the noble Earl and I signed more than two years ago the Report containing that often-quoted Resolution which, unless I am mistaken, forms the basis of all the proposals put forward by my noble friend. I ask your Lordships to remember that that Report was signed long before the Finance Bill of 1909 was dreamed of by anybody. I say, then, let us not be deterred from following the course on which we then embarked, nor, on the other hand, let us be terrified by alarmist impressions into proposing to this House far-reaching and reckless schemes of a kind to which none of us would have listened two or three years ago. We on these benches desire at any rate to take this question up, and, learning whatever there is to be learned from recent events, to deal with it according to the best of our powers.<lb/>
The noble Viscount opposite expressed some curiosity to see whether I should support my noble friend on the Cross Benches because, as he correctly reminded the House, when I was speaking in the debate on the Address a few weeks ago, I suggested that your Lordships might be well advised, before putting forward any proposals of your own to examine the proposals which were about to be submitted to the country by His Majesty's Government. The noble Viscount seemed to think that I had shifted my position. But it is not I who have shifted my position so much as His Majesty's Government who have shifted theirs. When I made the speech referred to we had in our hands the gracious Speech from the Throne in which it was clearly indicated that His Majesty's Government intended to deal not only with the powers of this House but with the constitution of this House. I was therefore ready to wait and to see what the proposals made by His Majesty's Government with regard to the constitution of the House might be. But,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0218"/>
<col>385</col>
my Lords, those proposals have faded away. They have been relegated to a very dim distance and I think my noble friend on the Cross Benches was unanswerable when he gave the House the reasons for which in his opinion it was extravagantly improbable that we should ever hear any more of them.<lb/>
At this moment we are face to face with the original proposal of His Majesty's Government, a policy which will give us what we have a right to describe as Single-Chamber Government in this country, and that being so I feel we are entirely at liberty to produce and to discuss any suggestions which we may have to make as to the manner in which the separate question of the reform of this House might be dealt with. I have observed that it is a common feature in all the many proposals that have been made for the reform of your Lordships' House that the working House should be greatly diminished in numbers, and that with that object a very considerable proportion of the number of Peers who now sit in it&#x2014;a proportion which I suppose would vary from one-fifth to one-half of the total number&#x2014;should be relieved of their duties and deprived of the privileges which they now enjoy as members entitled to sit and vote in the House. That is a very serious proposal, not only when regarded from the constitutional point of view, but also when regarded from the personal point of view. It is suggested that we are to ask a great number of the members of this House, for no fault of their own, to surrender privileges to which undoubtedly most of them attach the greatest value. I believe that that sacrifice would be deeply felt&#x2014;I believe it would be deeply resented by many members of this House. It is all very well to say that a great number of the members of this House are irregular in their attendance. Judging from a recent return, they are much less irregular in their attendance than some people would have us believe. But, surely, the explanation is not far to seek. They have many other calls upon their time; they know perfectly well that if they come here they will on many occasions find either not much work to do or not much opportunity of taking part in the work which is proceeding, and they therefore prefer to attend to the many calls and the many duties which require their presence in other parts of the country.<lb/>
<col>386</col>
My noble friend Lord Newton dealt with this question of the expulsion of what, I think, he called the undesirables in that light, humorous vein which always delights the House; but as I listened to him I could not help feeling that there was a tragical side also to this part of the question, and I wondered whether among the Peers who listened to him there were not many who were proud of the circumstances in which they had been called upon to take part in our business, anxious to transmit that great position intact to those who will come after them, and who would feel something like dismay at the prospect of seeing the doors of this Chamber suddenly shut in their face. At any rate, I feel, and I feel strongly, that common decency requires that a proposal of this sort should not be encouraged, certainly should not be imposed upon the House by members on this Bench until those whom it most affects have had the amplest opportunity of informing us of the manner in which they regard it. For that reason, among others, I am glad that my noble friend on the Cross Benches has taken up this question. His connection with it, as he told the House, is one of old standing. I think he rather prides himself upon his complete detachment from Party ties. He is free from that incurable obliquity of vision which my noble friend Lord Newton attributes to the occupants of both Front Benches&#x2014;an obliquity of vision which I think he will continue to attribute to them until he himself finds his way to one Front Bench or the other.<lb/>
I must also say that I think my noble friend's procedure in this matter should commend itself entirely to the House. It is a deliberate and a respectful procedure. He asks us to-night to advance one short stage and one short stage only. Next week he will ask us to accept from him the three Resolutions which are now upon the Paper; and I understand that when he has ascertained your Lordships' views, when he has had the opportunity of considering what has been said during the course of these discussions, he will proceed to put other Resolutions before us and endeavour to obtain our adhesion to those. That being so, I feel that to-night it is not necessary for us to deal minutely with questions of detail, and that all we need consider is the general and broader outline of the issue before us. For that reason I must decline the challenge, if
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0219"/>
<col>387</col>
it was one, thrown down by the noble Lord who spoke last, when he said that we really should not be able to advance matters until we had a fully developed and concrete scheme to lay before the House.<lb/>
May I, however, indicate in the most general terms one or two of the conditions which it seems to me should be fulfilled by any scheme of reform which would be likely to find general acceptance by your Lordships? In the first place, I venture to say that in voting for this Motion I do so looking forward, not to the abolition of this House, and the substitution for it of a wholly different House of Parliament, but to a scheme of reconstruction which shall maintain the fullest continuity between the House us we now know it and the House as we may know it hereafter. I trust that that continuity will be preserved, and that those traditions to which many of us cling will not lightly be tampered with. My noble friend on the Cross Benches has always recognised to some extent at all events, considerations of that kind. I take one sentence from the Report of his Committee, a sentence which, unless I am wrong, was drafted by his own hand. He expressed his view that we do not require a new and symmetrical Senate, but that it should be our object to preserve, as far as possible, the fabric and position of the House of Lords within the Constitution with such modifications as the circumstances of the time and the needs of efficiency seem to require; and I notice that in the Resolutions which he will move next week, he speaks, not of the abolition of this House or of the creation of a new Senate, but of the "reform and reconstruction of the House of Lords."<lb/>
I fully admit that it is not always easy to draw the line between changes which you can describe as reforms and changes which could be more properly described as revolutionary in their effect. All I can say as to that is that I hope we shall keep well on the right side of the line which divides the two. I hope that, if I may use a homely simile, we shall regard the present House of Lords as a going concern, possessing a substantial and valuable goodwill which ought not lightly to be sacrificed or thrown aside. I hope that, if we get rid of some of our superfluities and if we bring in new blood, we shall at any rate not part entirely with the old House and the old traditions, and for that reason let me say in passing that I should greatly regret any alteration in the name by which the Second Chamber might
<col>388</col>
hereafter be known in the Constitution of this country. It is a name with which many honourable traditions are associated. It is not a name, I venture to say, of which any member of this House need for a moment be ashamed.<lb/>
I know we are told that we have to reckon with a widespread antipathy to the hereditary principle. I venture to doubt whether that antipathy is quite so widespread as is supposed by some people. I know we shall be told&#x2014;I think the noble Earl told us that in certain parts of the United Kingdom with which he is familiar that antipathy is deep-rooted and irreconcilable. It may be irreconcilable in certain parts of the country; but if it is I do not believe for a moment that you are going to buy it off merely by tampering with the constitution of this House and adding a few members of the learned professions or a few county councillors to its strength. The irreconcilable antipathy which we are told exists will continue, and under some of the plans which have been suggested to us it will concentrate itself upon any survival of the hereditary principle which we agree to leave still in existence. But, apart from this irreconcilable antipathy, there is a great deal of what I may call suspicion, natural suspicion, of the hereditary principle and of the manner in which it operates in your Lordships' House; and I cannot help hoping that it is possible to deal with that kind of antipathy, that natural suspicion, on the one hand, by proving to the country by our legislation that we are able, in spite of the hereditary principle, to understand the requirements of the people of this country, and to meet them in a reasonable manner, and also by so adjusting our system of reform that the hereditary principle alone and without other tests of fitness shall not hereafter suffice in order to qualify a Peer to sit and vote in this House. That is the effect of the third Resolution to which the noble Earl will ask us to assent next week.<lb/>
It is upon those lines that I am ready to advance, but I am not prepared to renounce the hereditary principle in the sense in which I see that Sir Edward Grey has lately renounced it, nor am I prepared to admit, nor, I think, is Sir Edward Grey prepared to admit, that the recent verdict of the country can be regarded in any sense as a verdict against the hereditary principle. I go so far as to say that if, after appealing to the country, as we did last autumn on the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0220"/>
<col>389</col>
Finance Bill, we were to proclaim, because those feelings have been encountered by some of us in the country, that we were prepared to surrender the hereditary principle, we should stultify ourselves in the estimation of a great many of those whose opinions are most worthy to be taken into account. I will only add that in my opinion a scheme of reform will not fulfil the conditions which I have endeavoured to lay down if it is one which would merely leave to us a small and insignificant group of hereditary Peers submerged by other Lords of Parliament collected from various sources&#x2014;a small knot of Peers which might be exhibited hereafter as an interesting but impotent survival of a bygone political age.<lb/>
I would venture to suggest that there is a second characteristic which I should like to find in any scheme of reform accepted by your Lordships. It should be, if possible, a simple scheme and one which could be readily understood by the people of this country; and for that reason I greatly distrust many of the proposals which I have seen for collecting in this Chamber a number of interesting and conspicuous personalities taken either from public bodies or from the arts and sciences or from different religious denominations. What I think we have to remember is that eminence of this kind does not necessarily imply aptitude for the everyday work of Parliament. There is all the difference in the world between the expert and the legislator. I should not like to see this House composed largely of experts.<lb/>
I am afraid I must add that there is another apparently attractive suggestion which does not, however, greatly attract me. I mean the suggestion that we should add to our ranks a number of representatives of our Dominions over seas. Surely an Imperial Parliament is one thing and a Second Chamber another thing. I should moreover like to ask those who are most familiar with public opinion in the great Colonies whether those Colonies themselves would greatly care to be associated with us in the everyday work of our legislation. They have their own public business to attend to and we have ours, and although I yield to no one in my desire that these Colonial statesmen should receive every honour that we can offer them, I cannot help thinking that this particular honour is one of the least appropriate. I do not think the Colonies would part with their
<col>390</col>
best men in order that those men should attend regularly in your Lordships' House, and I do not think the Colonies would be grateful for the amount of representation which from the force of circumstances we should be able to give them by admitting what must necessarily be a small number of their public men to this Assembly. That is a proposal which I admit is picturesque and attractive, but I do not regard it as really a practical one.<lb/>
I turn to a third characteristic which I hope will be present in the reformed House. I trust we shall insist that it shall be so constituted as to be as independent as possible. We may be&#x2014;we are constantly taxed with it&#x2014;we may be a one-sided Assembly now, but we are independent. We are sometimes told of the manner in which the Whips control our proceedings. Those of us who are, so to speak, behind the scenes know how very little truth there is in that allegation. A Peer no doubt often owes his admission to this House to Party considerations, but once in this House he takes his own line, and is very apt to disregard the attempts of others to steer his course either to the right or to the left. I dwell upon this because it does not seem to me that the independence of the House would be likely to be increased if we were to carry out one of the proposals which I remember came before the Committee&#x2014;I mean the proposal that there should be a certain number of Lords of Parliament who would come in and go out with the Government. It seems to me that it should be <i>a sine qua non</i> that, whatever different categories of Peer you admit to this House, the tenure of their position as Lords of Parliament should be sufficiently secure to render them thoroughly independent. For that reason I should hope that any Lords of Parliament so appointed would be allowed to retain their position as Lords of Parliament, if not for their lives, at any rate for a term of years sufficiently long to give them what I think Mr. Gladstone once called durability of tenure.<lb/>
I come now to the size of the reformed House. I think there is pretty general agreement that this question requires consideration, and that in order to be efficient the House must be made considerably smaller. Its unwieldiness in point of number seems to me to be one of the most serious difficulties with which we have to contend. Since I have been a
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0221"/>
<col>391</col>
member of it something like 140 Peers have been added to our ranks, and I do not think it would be inaccurate to say that it probably never has occurrred to those who have bee responsible for these additions to the roll of Peers that it was desirable to take into account not only the fitness of the individual, but also the dimensions of the Assembly of which he was to be made a member. I do not know of any other case in which additions are made to public bodies&#x2014;big or little&#x2014;without any reference whatever to their existing numbers and to their efficiency from that point of view. A reduction in the number of this House would beyond all question have the effect of increasing the feeling of responsibility of each individual Peer, and for that reason alone would, I think, greatly add to its strength and authority.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, may I say one or two words as to the constitution of the reformed House of Lords, and I shall certainly, with the permission of the House, avoid details, because these clearly would be more appropriately considered when this discussion advances to its later stages. I wish in the first place to express my strong hope that in any new scheme it will be provided that a considerable portion of the reformed House shall be elected by the hereditary' Peers themselves. I will tell your Lordships why I press this proposal. I know that it is open to objection, I know that we may be told that if the hereditary principle is objectionable this arrangement would give you a kind of quintessence of the hereditary principle. But I recommend this suggestion, because, as I said a moment ago, I feel very strongly the extent of the sacrifice which we are asking those whom, for the sake of convenience, I will describe as the back-bench Peers to make, and this seems to me to be the only concession that you can make to them in return for that great sacrifice. I feel that the more strongly because I believe that unless you do something of this kind there will be no door open to the House through which we shall be able to admit that very valuable class of Peer who is, perhaps, not very widely known in public life, but who holds a useful and honourable position in his own neighbourhood, who is engaged in the local affairs of the county in which he lives, or perhaps in the affairs of the Territorial Force, and who might possibly disappear altogether from our midst unless there were some opening of this kind through which he
<col>392</col>
could have a chance of gaining admission to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
In the next place let me say that I entirely concur with what has been said by some of those who have addressed your Lordships as to the expediency of allowing a certain number of Lords of Parliament to hold their seats by virtue of what we commonly speak of as qualifications&#x2014;I mean official experience and position in public affairs. But I am bound to add, and I do not think the noble Earl will differ from me, that we found this one of the most difficult problems which we had to deal with when we were framing the Report of this Committee. The preparation of an adequate list of qualifications is an extraordinarily puzzling task. The further you go the more intricate become the problems which confront you, and I am, on the whole, disposed to believe, and there I am in agreement with the noble Lord who spoke just now, that the schedule of qualifications should not be too long, and that it should comprise only those whose antecedents and experience make it perfectly clear that there is no occasion to require them to submit themselves to election by their fellow Peers.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to what I suppose is the most difficult of the points which we shall have to take into consideration. I mean the question of the manner in which this House might be reinforced by additions from outside. And let me say at once that I am deeply convinced that, unless some proposal of this kind finds a place in our scheme of reform, it is really not much use to continue the discussion of the matter. But there will no doubt be a wide divergence of opinion both as to the source from which we should draw what the noble Earl aptly called "the breath of fresh air" and as to the volume of that breath. Is it to be merely the reviving current which come in when we induce the officials of the House to open one of these windows on a warm evening, or will it be the fiercer gale which, when the doors are opened at both ends, sweeps along these benches and causes untold misery to many of us?<lb/>
It may perhaps be desirable that we should consider and endeavour to clear our minds as to the objects for which this reinforcement from outside is held to be desirable. I think there are two. In the first place, it is necessary that we should have
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0222"/>
<col>393</col>
such reinforcement in order that we may do something to remove the disastrous disparity in number between the two sides of the House. It is becoming more marked as years go by, partly because of the increase in the total number of Peers, and partly on account of the large number of Peers who take an active part in our affairs. But the result is that, however sincere and impartial we may be, the country is profoundly convinced that we are not impartial. As my noble friend Lord Newton said, appearances are against us. It seems to me that we must do something to remove that disparity. And it is a disparity, remember, not only in number, but consequentially in debating strength. We can not only outvote you, but we can out-talk you. The result, I am afraid of the relative weakness of your Benches, is that on many occasions the other side of the case is not quite adequately put forward. We should greatly prefer to be encountered by a little more resistance and to have fuller statements than we sometimes obtain of the merits of Government proposals rather than to be allowed the kind of walk-over which too often is the end of our debates. The second object for which it seems to me we require an outside reinforcement is&#x2014;I use the word in fear and trembling because my noble and learned friend (Lord Halsbury) is behind me&#x2014;in order that this House may be brought into closer connection with political opinion outside these walls. I am persuaded myself that we are, in fact, much less out of touch than people suppose. but I do not think the country quite realises it, and, therefore, I for one am in favour of a change which shall bring us outwardly and visibly into closer touch with the democracy of this country.<lb/>
How is this closer connection to be brought about? We have had suggestions, very important suggestions, from the noble Earl (Lord Rosebery) and from my noble friend Lord Curzon, as to the possibility of having recourse to election. I desire, and I do not think it is an unreasonable request, to await the precise proposals which, no doubt, at some future time, will be submitted to us. I cordially appreciate the caution with which my noble friend behind me treated the question of outside election. He was, I think, at pains to explain that he did not contemplate any thing like popular or direct election. He sketched to us an ingenious scheme of indirect election, on which he proposed to rely. I only desire to suggest, for the consideration of the House,
<col>394</col>
that there are one or two difficulties inherent in these proposals which we shall have to examine, and which we shall have to meet. In the first place, I would ask whether it is quite clear that, by resorting to indirect election of this kind we should do very much towards redressing that disparity in numbers to which I referred a few moments ago. It seems to me quite likely that your eighty elected members would not by any means all represent one political Party. They might be equally divided, in which case the disparity would remain as bad as before. Then, I suggest that we should think very carefully before we import into the affairs of the great municipalities a political element which most of us desire, if possible, to keep away from them. It would be a disservice to our great municipalities, supposing any other way of arriving at the desired end is open to us, if we were actually to go out of our way to encourage them to take sides in the politics of the day, and I own to some feelings of misgiving as to the possibility of working side by side a system based partly on heredity and partly on election. I do not feel convinced that the two systems would run kindly and operate smoothly side by side.<lb/>
I would add one further word with regard to this matter of election. When we are told, as I think that we have been told, that it is commonly resorted to in the case of Second Chambers in foreign countries or in our own Colonies, we should bear in mind that in the case of many of those countries we are dealing with communities which have a Federal system, a system under which it is the duty of the Second Chamber not only to act as a check upon the popular and elected Chamber, but also to watch over and protect the interests of the Federated States, and to guard them against encroachment on the part of the central Government. That is, of course, a state of things which, unless noble Lords opposite are successful in carrying out the federation of the united Kingdom we do not contemplate in this country. I do not, however, desire to press these objections too far. All that I do suggest in this discussion, which is necessarily a preliminary discussion, is that these are points which we shall have to consider and face before we arrive at a conclusion; and, be that as it may, I remain of the opinion that some means must be found of reinforcing the new House of Lords from outside.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0223"/>
<col>395</col>
Is it quite dear that it is only in the direction of election that we can look for this purpose? I own that it seems to me that there are other modes which deserve to be considered. In the extraordinarily interesting speech delivered by my noble friend Lord Curzon I thought no passage was more interesting and instructive than that in which he showed that the House of Lords in its origin was not purely an hereditary Chamber, and that at the present moment it is far from being a purely hereditary Chamber. No less than one-fourth of the members of this House, as my noble friend pointed out, owe their presence in this building not to what is called the mere accident of birth, but to a different title. Should it not be possible to strengthen this non-hereditary element in your Lordships' House? At present all the appointments to the Peerage rest with His Majesty the King on the advice of his Ministers. Why should not it be possible that prerogative to be exercised hereafter in pursuance of some well-thought-out and reasonably restricted scheme for the purpose of bringing into this House from time to time a number of members who might adequately represent that particular set of political opinions which happened at the time to be inadequately represented in the House? Is there any reason why the Ministry of the day should not have fuller opportunities of advising the Sovereign to create Peers and also of nominating them to serve as Peers of Parliament? Again, I make the reservation that such Peerages would no doubt be held by a tenure which would give to every Lord of Parliament a position sufficiently secure and permanent to make him perfectly independent.<lb/>
And closely connected with this question is the question of life Peerages. I have always been an advocate of life Peerages. I have never been able to see why, if it is desired to recompense an individual by the grant of a Peerage, it should be necessary also to ennoble his descendants for all time. And it does not seem to me beside the mark to suggest that, if the practice of creating life Peerages were to be resorted to, it would in that manner be possible without difficulty to add members to this House who might be adequate representatives of any schools of political thought, or of any great interests which it might be desirable to represent. And in that manner also, it would surely be possible, if
<col>396</col>
you wish to recognise the great municipalities, to single out for preferment gentlemen who have distinguished themselves in local administration, to make them life Peers and to call them up to this House for a term of years. All these are suggestions which one can only indicate in the most general terms, but which I cannot help thinking we ought to consider as the discussion proceeds.<lb/>
To-night, all we can do is to indicate our attitude towards the proposal which is actually before us on the Paper, the proposal that we should go into Committee as suggested by the noble Earl, and in that respect I venture to think that the attitude of those who will support the Motion of the noble Earl compares not unfavourably with the attitude of the supporters of His Majesty's Government. The part taken by His Majesty's Government in the history of this question is, I cannot help thinking, not entirely creditable. They gave us no assistance when the Committee was appointed, and their present plans, so far as we are aware of them, are of the most elusive and unstable character. It is scarcely necessary to recapitulate the quick changes which have taken place in the policy of His Majesty's Government. We had at first the proposals connected with the name of the late Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, which would have had the effect of depriving us of all power except perhaps that of delaying for a few months the passage of a dangerous measure. Then upon these they superadded the proposal to deprive us of all power of dealing with measures connected with finance, but we have never yet elicited from them a definition of their views as to what is or what is not a finance measure, or as to the means which it would be possible to adopt in order to enable us to obtain a decision when there is a doubt whether a particular measure is or is not a measure dealing with finance. Up to that point, however, the Government avoided altogether touching the question of the composition of this House.<lb/>
Then came a change. During the course of the election campaign the Government discovered that for platform purposes nothing was so valuable to them as denunciation of this House and of the hereditary principle, and they realised that there was something almost grotesque
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0224"/>
<col>397</col>
in using that language on the platform and in refusing to touch the hereditary principle when they came back to Parliament. Accordingly they made the proposal embodied in the Speech from the Throne, under which they were to deal not only with the powers but also with the composition of this House. But their more extreme supporters were not prepared to undertake the question of dealing with the constitution of this House, and before the ink was dry on the Speech from the Throne His Majesty's Government abandoned the proposal to deal with the constitution of the House, and fell back on their old position of dealing with the Veto alone.<lb/>
There is a still later phase&#x2014;because it is, I think, a new phase&#x2014;that indicated by Sir E. Grey in a speech recently delivered by him. From that speech most of us inferred that the proposal to deprive the House of Lords of its powers is limited to the House, of Lords as at present constituted; and that it is his intention, when the House of Lords has been deprived of the Veto <i>ad hoc</i>, then to reconstitute the House and to restore to it some of the powers of which it is now sought to deprive it. My Lords, it is to these contradictions and changes that you have been driven by your desire to make terms with supporters whose support is such an unstable and inconstant quantity. To-night, after all this dodging, after all these attempts to shelter yourselves first in one position and then in another, we of the Opposition find ourselves face to face with this situation, that the Government are going in the space of a few days to ask us to concur with their proposals for depriving this House of all its powers and for setting up what will virtually be a system of Single-Chamber Government. That is a tremendous innovation. It means the virtual destruction of a House which, as has been truly said, has not only a great tradition in these islands, but looms large in the estimation of the British Empire. I ask your Lordships which policy is the more reasonable, the more patriotic, the more straightforward of the two? You, the Government, think, and we think, that this House is badly composed. We are ready to consider the question of its composition and to compose it better if we can. We are ready, when that has been accomplished, to deal if need be with the relations between the two
<col>398</col>
Houses, and to endeavour to devise means of extrication whenever an apparently insoluble difficulty may arise between the two Houses. That is our policy. That, I imagine, was your policy as lately as February 21, when the King's Speech was put on the Table. Between the two policies we are ready that the country should judge. We are content, to-night, as the first step towards the accomplishment of our policy, to support the Motion of the noble Earl to go into Committee, and, speaking for myself, I am prepared&#x2014;and I believe many others are also&#x2014;to support him not only to that extent, but to the extent of voting for the three Resolutions which he has put on the Table of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00789"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need hardly repeat what was said by my noble friend behind me, that we do not propose to offer any opposition to the Motion. Any Motion brought forward by my noble friend on the Cross Benches with his unrivalled force of eloquence is bound to receive the respectful consideration of this House, and in this particular case we know that the cause is one to which he has for many years devoted close attention and profound thought. On general grounds we on this side of the House are perfectly satisfied that this question should receive as full discussion as your Lordships may desire to give to it.<lb/>
Allusion has been made to the fact that we did not as a Government take part in the deliberations of the Committee of 1907. My noble friend behind me, Lord Courtney, has given an accurate description of our reasons for refraining from doing so, and he was also quite accurate in saying that, far from discouraging those who think with us from taking part in its deliberations, we were thoroughly glad that they should do so. I am bound to say that, after carefully reading the Report of the Committee, I do not regret our action. I do not think we should have been able to render any substantial service to noble Lords opposite. The variety of views expressed in the Committee was quite great enough without adding to those divergent opinions others which might have been propounded from these Benches. At the same time, there was a class of persons who might perhaps more appropriately have sought places on the Committee&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0225"/>
<col>399</col>
those whom it is proposed, as the noble Marquess gracefully put it, to relieve of their duties in this House. They did not find any very strong representation on the Committee. In fact, I do not know that in any of the schemes which are put forward the noble Lords who composed that Committee would not all find themselves members of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
In our view the primary and urgent question at this moment is that concerned with the relations between the two Houses, but certainly, speaking for myself, I have never at any time disregarded the possible effect of the composition of the House, either as it now is or might be, upon those relations, and I have never, therefore, desired to check any such discussion as this, even if it had been in my power to do so. I do not propose, in the remarks I am going to make, to enter in any way into the discussion of the various schemes which have been alluded to in broad outline in the course of this debate. They have exhibited, I think, considerable divergences of opinion. The most rev. Primate spoke of that as inevitable, and seemed to be sanguine that all the differences of opinion which had been expressed might in some manner be reconciled, but I am not sure that he was not too sanguine, because on the Benches opposite we have heard different expressions of opinion which seem to me to cut very deep indeed as regards the principles on which you desire to reform this House. Neither do I propose to devote to-day any part of my speech to the discussion of the question which occupied so large a part of my noble friend's speech and was also alluded to by the noble Marquess and other speakers&#x2014;namely, the Resolutions which were originally introduced in another place by the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x2014;or to argue now the question as to whether those Resolutions, if brought into effect, would as a fact constitute anything approaching single-Chamber government. I do not argue that now.<lb/>
But I wish to say this quite categorically, that His Majesty's Government are in favour of a bi-cameral system in this country, not merely because we are convinced that the two-Chamber system is the one that suits this country best, but also for the very good reason that we are convinced that the great majority of the inhabitants of this country hold the same view. We have to consider, in dealing with this question, the House as it is. My noble friend's Motion
<col>400</col>
speaks of a strong and efficient Second Chamber. I think the House of Lords, as it now exists, fulfils both these conditions. Surely you are strong enough in all conscience! Look back on the history of the last four years. You have succeeded in getting rid of two, at any rate, of our most important projects of legislation, if not the most important. You have also very summarily disposed of various minor measures. You have introduced Amendments which in many cases we were unwilling to accept, but which we did accept. And finally, as the end of your exhibition of fireworks, you had what I think is technically termed a set-piece, which involved the rejection of the Finance Bill of last year. I do not know whether there is any Second Chamber in the world, however constituted, which can or does exercise more power. Therefore, if only strength is required, I submit that you are strong enough already. I have never been one of those who have spoken, in or out of the House, as though the House were anything but efficient. There is no need to labour that point. It seems to me that this House does its business well. It contains, as we know, a large number of members of the highest distinction, and Lord Onslow, as Chairman of Committees, will agree that its conduct of private business is beyond reproach. If strength and efficiency were all you require, you may well leave the House alone.<lb/>
But we are told the hereditary principle is unpopular. I do not think the hereditary principle in itself is in the least unpopular in this country. Quite the contrary. I believe it is extremely popular, whether those who like it found their opinion on the lessons of history or on the analogy of the stud-book. Pedigree in itself is considered to be something of a recommendation to any man in this country, whether he be a member of your Lordships' House or not. Lord Curzon spoke yesterday of the number of eldest sons of Peers who obtained seats in another place. I thought that in some respects that was rather a dangerous argument for him to use. But it certainly confirms the opinion which I hold, that the members of your Lordships' House are far from being unpopular in the country. But, my Lords, what is unpopular is the uncontrolled exercise of hereditary power. It is that which, no doubt, has given your Lordships some pause, and has caused you to desire some measure of reform.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0226"/>
<col>401</col>
I was struck by an observation which fell from the noble Marquess, and I think it is one which your Lordships may well take to heart. It is this&#x2014;that when you begin to combine in this House the hereditary element with an element of an entirely different character, the slightest exercise of hereditary power will, as the noble Marquess said, concentrate criticism upon that element in this House if that power is used in opposition to the wishes of any large body of people in this country. Then, again, on the hereditary principle, we have been taunted, very often good-humouredly enough, on the fact that the not inconsiderable additions of Liberal Peers which have been made from time to time to this House have not resulted in any permanent change, in anything like the same proportion, in its political composition. But it seems to me that involves not so much a charge against the noble Lords as a charge against this House, because it implies that the atmosphere of this Chamber is so asphyxiating that unless a man comes here fortified by at least a double dose of Liberal antitoxin he may in his own person succumb to its influence, and that, so far as his son is concerned, he is likely to be Torified into obscurity on the benches opposite.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, in defending the hereditary principle, spoke of what would be the opinion in the Dominions over sea, and also in India, if there were a serious departure from that principle. What he said about the views of the Dominions was, I confess, new to me. I do not know from what experience he spoke. I have no doubt he spoke from some. But I confess that during my communications, which have not been infrequent, with Colonial statesmen of eminence, I have never heard that point of view put forward. I have no doubt the noble Lord speaks by the card, but, as I say, that point of view has not fallen in any way within my experience. Then my noble friend on the Cross Benches, speaking of our Resolutions, asked what sort of a position should I be in if I had to write a Despatch to South Africa informing them that we were setting up a powerless Second Chamber, whereas we had recently assisted them in setting up a powerful one. But my experience of the Dominions is that they like to mind their own business and to leave us to mind ours. We most carefully and avowedly refrained from any inter-
<col>402</col>
ference or suggestion in the South Africa Act in regard to such matters as the composition and powers of the two Chambers; and, speaking generally on the Imperial aspect of the question, I say that if this question of the House of Lords is really an Imperial question, I should like to ask&#x2014;would you desire to have the question of the composition of this House appear on the agenda paper of the Imperial Conference? The composition of the Imperial Parliament is an entirely different thing from the question of a Second Chamber, and I think that, so far as I am able to judge, the ultimate form which the House of Lords may take will not be regarded by the self-governing Dominions as a matter which can in any way inflict any grievance upon them.<lb/>
As regards India, I speak with great diffidence in the presence of the noble Lord and the noble Marquess. We all know very well that India, unlike Adam and Eve, does not smile at the claims of long descent. But I should have thought that what India regarded most in looking westward was the illustrious position of the Sovereign, of that unequalled line which goes back through Stuart, Tudor, and Plantagenet Kings for 1,100 years to the dim ages of the Saxon Monarchy. I can quite believe that in India the <i>novus homo</i> is less thought of than the man of descent. But it had not struck me that the special fact that this House was of a purely hereditary character would be regarded in India as a matter of great and Imperial importance.<lb/>
Now I pass to the consideration of a different aspect of this question. What is really at the back of these plans for reforming the House of Lords? What is the supposed necessity for it? I believe I know what is in the mind of my noble friend on the Cross Benches. My noble friend is convinced of the mischief of Party government as now carried out. To borrow that well-known and often stolen saying of the second Lord Shaftesbury, my noble friend thinks that all sensible men are of the same politics, and he might go on to say that what those politics are sensible men never tell. That is where the silent voter comes in, no doubt. I am perfectly certain that if my noble friend had his way he would place all those benches on a turntable and turn them into a position facing the Throne. I do not think I am wronging
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0227"/>
<col>403</col>
my noble friend in saying that his idea of reforming the House of Lords is to obtain a House which would be entirely of a cross-bench character. That is to say, it would take an impartial view as between Parties&#x2014;which, of course, is the most any Assembly can take, for an Assembly is not a tribunal and therefore cannot take an impartial view of a subject&#x2014;and its composition would be such that it would not unduly favour one Party or the other. I fully admit the attraction of such an idea. I fully admit that if you could get a Second Chamber so minded it would be valuable in any Constitution, and I think I have been able to perceive from some of the speeches made opposite that that idea to a certain extent appeals to some noble Lords. At any rate, I may say that in some of those speeches we have had a great deal more of sweet reasonableness&#x2014;of what I may call patriotic detachment&#x2014;than I have had the advantage of enjoying during the last four years during which we have been sitting on these benches. In fact, while one or two noble Lords were speaking we on this side, I think, almost felt as people do when they are listening to a fine organ in a great cathedral. They feel elevated to unaccustomed heights of moral grandeur and capable of almost unheard-of possibilities of self-sacrifice. But you walk out of the church into the grey streets and the work-a-day world, and you find that, after all, you have to do the best with the tools that you have ready to hand.<lb/>
Well, the tool that we have ready to hand in this country in our political work is the Party system. I do not for a moment deny the faults of the Party system. I sympathise with a great deal of what was said by the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury. It is quite true that in the conduct of elections, as now carried on, and, I suppose, as always carried on, there is much that is hateful to a man of fine honour and absurd to a man of fine humour. But we hear just the same lament when we are discussing religious questions. People say, "Oh, why must we suffer these controversies of Church and Chapel and why, when we are discussing such a question as education, cannot people take a detached view and speak of the really great things of this life and the next?" But the churches are the instruments, in the belief of those who belong to them, for carrying great moral ideas into operation. And so it is that we cannot in this country, situated
<col>404</col>
as we are, get rid of the Party system, which, after all, has its good side. It means common action between men who in the main agree; it means the contact of mind with mind; it means loyalty between one set of men and another set of men; and it also means that searching kind of self-examination which enables one to see that what one takes for principles are often only preconceptions or prejudices. What I ask is&#x2014;Are you proposing, in reforming this House, to break up the Party system altogether? I fully believe that my noble friend on the Cross Benches and some other noble Lords would do so if they could. But is this proposed reform in that respect going to make any real difference?<lb/>
I noticed in the speech of Lord Curzon yesterday that after speaking of the too great numbers which by agreement are to be found in this House, he said,
<quote>"The second feeling is a feeling of regret that no machinery has ever been devised by which the Liberal Party, when it is in a great majority in the House of Commons, can obtain adequate reflection of its predominance in this House."</quote>
I do not, I confess, exactly know what is meant by an adequate reflection of its predominance, but I attach a general meaning to the words. Then the noble Lord went on&#x2014;
<quote>"I believe that if any scheme could be devised&#x2014;and I think such a scheme is a necessary part of any measure of reform&#x2014;by which the Liberal Party could be assured of a more permanent representation in this House it would meet with the most ready acceptance of those who sit on this side."</quote>
That statement was received by noble Lords opposite in gloomy silence.</membercontribution></p>

This seems to me to be the real position&#x2014;the live question with regard to this matter of reform. Are you going to try,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0228"/>
<col>405</col>
and, if you try, can you, turn this House into a Second Chamber of which the actions on any particular subject cannot be precisely foreseen in the manner in which they are at this moment? During all the time that we have been in office the majority in this House has worked in absolute rhythm with the leaders of the Opposition in another place. That, I think, cannot be disputed. Are you going to turn this House into something of which that can in no way be said? I notice your Lordships claim full powers with regard to finance&#x2014;at any rate, with regard to the rejection of all Bills containing money provisions, and those provisions themselves. That, of course, we contest, but I do not dwell upon that at this moment. Well, are you going to create a Second Chamber which, by any conceivable possibility, could deal with a Tariff Reform measure sent up by a large Conservative majority in another place in the same manner as you have dealt with our land value proposals? I confess that so far as I am able to study any of the schemes of reform which are put forward it does not seem to me that you are going to create a Second Chamber of such a nature as that.<lb/>
Many speakers opposite have spoken of the independent character of your Lordships. I am speaking, of course, solely and simply of political independence&#x2014;independence which is the result of study of a particular subject, and a conviction thus formed. If there is much such independence in this House I must say that we do not see many visible signs of it. The noble Marquess in speaking just now seemed to imply that dark struggles sometimes take place behind the scenes&#x2014;grapplings between him and his supporters who insist upon steering their own course. But, my Lords, they never steer it our way. I think if there was anything in this House that could be called political independence it must surely lead to a few more protests against the strong action often taken by noble Lords opposite, and, I should have thought, to a little more cross-voting. I remember that on the first Education Bill of 1906 we had the great advantage, which I always recollect with pride, of securing in the final Division the vote of a man who, I think, carried more weight than anybody in the House&#x2014;the late Duke of Devonshire. He brought with him, I think, one noble Lord to swell our
<col>406</col>
attenuated ranks. Then there was the independence of a noble Lord from Scotland, who recorded a vote&#x2014;not in favour of the Budget, but against the proposal of the noble Marquess to refer the Budget, as he said, to the country. <i>Post hoc</i> is not always <i>propter hoc</i>, still it is the fact&#x2014;whether <i>pour encourager les autres</i> or not I cannot say&#x2014;that that particular noble Lord found himself at the election to the present Parliament relegated to that state of suspended animation peculiar to Scottish Peers which was so well described by Lord Curzon.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00795"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: He was a representative Peer. He is also an hereditary nobleman. I am speaking of the encouragements which are dealt out by noble Lords to independent action. Somebody, I rather think it was my noble friend Lord Rosebery, spoke of the superior independence of this House as compared with the other House, where a man could not speak his mind freely. In the last twenty-five years there have been three great political convulsions&#x2014;in 1886 upon Home Rule, in 1899 about the South African War, and in 1903 on the subject of Tariff Reform. On all those occasions, so far as I can recollect, many men in another place spoke their mind with the utmost freedom, very often, I take it, running the risk of losing their seats, and in one case confronted with the most odious of all charges, that of lack of patriotism. The only occasion, it is quite true, on which a man could not speak his independent mind in another place was in 1903 on the subject of Tariff Reform, when it happened not to suit the book of noble Lords opposite and their friends to allow the question to be discussed.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said&#x2014;and I do not for a moment question his sincerity, of course, in this matter&#x2014;that he lamented the disparity of numbers here and that he would like to see a little more resistance both in speaking and in voting. I am quite conscious how often it happens that, speaking for myself, I am not able to cope with the quality and the quantity of the eloquence of the Front Bench opposite. Nobody could be more conscious of that. But does this mean&#x2014;I am really asking for information&#x2014;that noble Lords want victory to be a little more creditable, but desire it to remain
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0229"/>
<col>407</col>
equally certain? I cannot say that my noble friends behind me have always received the fullest encouragement from noble Lords opposite to take part in debate, even in this debate, but setting that aside, I am quite certain that the greater number of our supporters in another place and those who agree with us in the country believe that the object of noble Lords opposite in desiring to reform this House is to go on exactly as you have been going on as regards dealing with our measures, but to do so with less exposure to criticism, which, after all, is very often of a trivial kind&#x2014;founded, I mean, on the existence in your Lordships' House of what are known as the black sheep, or of the supposed incompetence of some noble Lords to take a proper part in the business of the House. Those arguments are galling to noble Lords opposite, but they need not be anything more, because everybody knows that the absence or presence of those noble Lords never really affects your decision upon any political question.<lb/>
However much you may wish to get rid of it, the deliberate opinion of a large number of people in the country will be that your Lordships, being Party men and having acted, not the least to your discredit, as such, merely desire to consolidate the power of the Unionist party, which you believe to be the best engine for good that could be politically devised, on a somewhat sounder foundation. And you are claiming more power, because all these schemes are calculated to limit the prerogative of the Crown in the creation of Peers. You may say that it is a weapon which could seldom be used, and which in many cases it might be difficult to use; but every writer who has written on the Constitution speaks of that power as the one check on the uncontrolled supremacy of the House of Lords, and with that check you are asking the country to part.<lb/>
I come back to the real point at issue, which is the deadlock that exists between the two Houses. No one, I think, except my noble friend Lord Courtney has suggested any method of dealing with the subject of deadlocks, and I think it was evident that the method which he proposed would not commend itself to noble Lords opposite because it could be brought into operation only by a serious diminution of the numbers of your Lordships' House. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Halsbury, in speaking last night, was not far off the
<col>408</col>
mark when he said that such schemes of reform as appeared to be favoured on the bench opposite must have the effect of increasing rather than diminishing the number of deadlocks between the two Houses in future years. Surely one reason which has been in people's minds when they have hesitated so long to touch this question of reform of the House of Lords has been that any considerable reform must destroy, or at any rate weaken, in a great degree the unwritten understandings which have obtained between this House and the other. It may be that those unwritten understandings have been so rudely shaken by recent events that some who desire to reform your Lordships' House may think that they have been ignored and that, therefore, it may be possible now to proceed with reform.<lb/>
But when you have succeeded, if you do, in reforming the character of your Lordships' House, if you put your scheme into writing, will not the House of Commons say, "How do we stand with regard to the privileges which we have explicitly claimed for more than 200 years as being the practice from immemorial times?" Take the Resolution of 1678, partly recognised and, though grumbled against, accepted in some degree by your Lordships' House. What guarantee is there, and who is going to give such a guarantee, that the new House will recognise in any way the Resolution of 1678 or any other Resolution which members of the new House of Lords might be entitled to say was directed against an entirely different Chamber in a different set of circumstances? Nobody could give that guarantee. The noble Marquess would not take so false a step, because it would imply that he possessed the same control over the new House as over the present one, and that is what I imagine the noble Marquess would not desire us to believe.<lb/>
But, surely, it is a very serious consideration that in altering the House of Lords in this way you are tearing up, if it is not a bull to say so, this unwritten Constitution as it exists between the two Houses. I think for that and other reasons the House of Commons will undoubtedly claim to have its say in the manner in which this House is to be reformed. You have always claimed a very considerable say in the proceedings of the House of Commons with regard to its reform. In 1832 and 1884 your Lordships took strong steps to obtain your wishes with
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0230"/>
<col>409</col>
regard to the manner and in some degree the character of that reform. It is no desire of ours to discourage full discussion on this subject. Like the noble Marquess, whose history of recent events and of our proceedings in this regard I cannot admit to be accurate, we say that we must take our own line, and we leave the outcome to the judgment of the country, setting our case before the country because, as we all know, it is for the benefit
<col>410</col>
of the country, and for that alone, that our whole Parliamentary system exists.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00832">House again in Committee (according to order) to consider the best means of reforming its existing organisation so as to constitute a strong and efficient Second Chamber.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00833">[The EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00834" align="center">THE FIRST RESOLUTION.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00835"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move the first Resolution that stands in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00836">Moved to resolve, That a strong and efficient Second Chamber is not merely an integral part of the British Constitution, but is necessary to the well-being of the State and to the balance of Parliament.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Rosebery.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00837"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether this Resolution, or, indeed, any of the Resolutions, is likely to lead to a very extended discussion. I think, perhaps, I ought to repeat the opinion which I stated on the original Motion of my noble friend, to the effect that
<col>414</col>
in our view&#x2014;our view is well known to your Lordships&#x2014;the more urgent question is that of the relations between the two Houses. With regard to this first Resolution, again I need only repeat what I said on that occasion, that His Majesty's Government are of opinion that a Constitution of two Chambers is the one best suited to the needs and requirements of this country. But as regards the wording of the particular Resolution, it seems to me to be a case, if I may quote the saying of a well-known sage, in which "the bearing of the observation lies in the application of it." From one point of view everybody would desire that the Second Chamber should be strong and efficient&#x2014;that is to say, that the people who sit in it should be strong in the sense in which you speak of a strong Committee. For instance, the Committee which was originally formed to consider this whole question on the Motion of my noble friend was undoubtedly an extremely strong Committee, although its terms of reference were not very wide. In that sense we should all of us agree that the Second Chamber should be strong and also it should be efficient. But, of course, we on this side of the House must guard ourselves against its being supposed, if we raise no objection to the Motion, that by a strong Second Chamber we mean a Second Chamber which is to possess and to exercise more power against the House of Commons than your Lordships have at present. If that is the meaning which it is desired to imply in the terms of the Resolution, of course we should not agree to it. For instance, what is called a strong Second Chamber might insist upon a supposed right to examine the details and amend all manner of financial provisions in different Bills. But subject to its being clearly understood that we do not desire to increase the powers of your Lordships' House, which some of us may be disposed to consider already excessive, I do not wish, on behalf of my noble friends behind me, to offer any opposition to this Resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00838"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had no intention of taking part in this debate when I entered the House, but one or two observations fell from the noble Earl the Leader of the House which, I think, justify us in asking for a little explanation. The noble Earl has told us that he does not desire to oppose the Motion of the noble Earl on the understanding that the reformed House of Lords is not to be a stronger Chamber than is your Lordships'
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0233"/>
<col>415</col>
House at the present moment. I must say I do not think the noble Earl has ever led us to believe anything else. So far as I gather from the proposals of his colleagues, the idea is to weaken this House and to turn it into a Chamber with no power of any sort or kind in controlling any action of the House of Commons&#x2014;a Chamber which would not have the power of rejecting any measure sent up to it by the House of Commons. In those circumstances I can quite understand the noble Earl saying that he does not desire to have a stronger Chamber. What is proposed is that the Second Chamber should eventually become a House of absolute nonentities. There was another expression which fell from the noble Earl which I would notice. He told us that he and his colleagues were in favour of a Second Chamber. I conclude that it is the Second Chamber to which I have alluded. But I read in this morning's newspaper a speech by the Home Secretary at Manchester in which he stated that he would in no way object to the country being governed by a single Chamber. Consequently, if the right hon. gentleman was speaking for the Government I find it somewhat difficult to reconcile the statement of the noble Earl who has just sat down with that of the Home Secretary. And I find it more difficult to reconcile the statement of the Home Secretary with that of his chief at Oxford, who a short time ago made a statement entirely different from that made by the Home Secretary on Saturday last. It would be interesting to know who really represents the Cabinet at the present moment&#x2014;the Prime Minister, the noble Earl, or the Home Secretary. So far as I can see, we are entirely in the dark as to the views of the Government with respect to the proposals of my noble friend Lord Rosebery, and with regard to the future which they intend for your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00839"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help thinking that at this stage the House is in rather an unsatisfactory position. We are asked to affirm a Resolution which may have I do not know how many meanings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00840"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00841"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It may mean that strength and efficiency, which are most admirable qualities, should be present in this House, as I trust they will always be present in either House&#x2014;it may mean that,
<col>416</col>
in which case it would be the affirmation to a commonplace, which I am far from supposing could possibly be the object of the noble Earl. On the contrary, from his speech in the previous debate it is obvious that he had some genuine and quite distinct proposals in his mind. What are those proposals? It can be of no particular value to the House to make a general affirmation of this kind unless it is filled out with sufficient detail&#x2014;I do not say with minute detail&#x2014;but with sufficient matter to enable us to know what it is that we are asked to affirm and what it is that those who may dissent from this Resolution are asked to deny; because when a Resolution of this kind has been passed it will be open to any number of interpretations upon the intention and meaning of the House. It seems to me that our position is simple enough. Our position is this. We are, I believe, a Government in favour of a Second Chamber. The real point upon which we differ from noble Lords opposite is not in regard to the composition of the Second Chamber, as to which we know nothing at present of the intentions of the Government, but in regard to the powers of the Second Chamber, on which we know there is a distinct and acute difference between us. I venture to suggest that it is not we who have to offer explanations, although we shall before long, I hope, put definite and specific proposals before the House for their consideration; but I cannot doubt for a moment that after the Report of the Committee of this House which sat eighteen months or two years ago, and after the speeches, full of suggestions of different kinds, that were made during the debate last week&#x2014;I cannot doubt that there is some plan in the mind of the noble Earl or in the minds of other noble Lords who supported the proposal to go into Committee, and ought we not as soon as possible, in order to facilitate the usefulness of our discussion, to know what those proposals are? I mean so far, at all events, as they are proposals on which the body of the House represented by the noble Marquess are agreed. I hope we may be able in that way to obtain some early and fruitful results from the discussion which has been initiated upon the Motion of the noble Earl to go into Committee to consider this question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00842"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the attitude of the noble and learned Lord is, unless I misunderstand him, considerably more critical towards this Resolution than the attitude of the noble Earl who
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0234"/>
<col>417</col>
leads the House. We understood the noble Earl to regard the Resolution as at any rate an innocuous one. The noble and learned Lord, on the contrary, sees danger in it in consequence of the ambiguity of its language, and he insists particularly upon the ambiguity of the word "strong" in the phrase "strong and efficient Second Chamber." I am not responsible for the drafting of these Resolutions. At the same time I think my noble friend on the Cross Benches made it clear, and I think some of those who spoke on this side of the House made it perfectly clear, that when we spoke of a strong Second Chamber we meant not a strong Second Chamber in the sense of a Chamber which was strong in point of numbers, or indeed, in point of ability, but a Second Chamber which would be strong in the authority which it possessed&#x2014;authority which it could only derive from the amount of public confidence which it inspired. It is interpreting the formula of my noble friend on the Cross Benches in that sense, and in that sense alone, that I shall vote with him for this Resolution. In regard to the question of the powers of this House, I do not think it has occurred to any of us to suggest that the powers which we now possess should be in any way increased. What we do protest against, and we protest as strongly as we can, is that those powers should be reduced&#x2014;I may almost say nullified&#x2014;by the Resolutions which we understand will shortly be presented to Parliament by His Majesty's Government. The powers of the House of Lords are of so modest a kind that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, who will forgive me for again referring to him, told us the other evening that we had in effect already in this country a system of single-Chamber Government. Therefore I think we are right in assuming that our present powers are not of an inordinate character or of a character which should be tampered with. The other criticism of the noble and learned Lord was, I think, this, that he took some objection to this House being asked to commit itself to a somewhat vaguely worded proposition of this kind, and he said he thought it would be fairer to the House if the details were somewhat more copiously filled in. I agree that we must make up our minds to face the more detailed aspects of this important question. But there, again, the plan of campaign of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches seems to me to be a reasonable one. It is to obtain the adherence of the House in the first place to general
<col>418</col>
propositions of a preliminary kind, and then to build on those other propositions which he will elaborate as time goes on. Therefore, I shall without any hesitation give my vote for the Resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00843"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only rise for the purpose of correcting the noble Marquess's representation of what I ventured to say in the course of my speech on Monday evening last. I certainly did not mean to say that already we are governed by a single-Chamber Government. That would have been obviously absurd in face of the fact that your Lordships have thrown out a very important Bill, following other important Bills which your Lordships had rejected. All that I said was this&#x2014;and I think it is worth consideration in the debates that are coming on in this House and in the country&#x2014;that I am against a single-Chamber Government. I think there are mischiefs in it which we ought to prevent. But I wanted your Lordships not to be frightened by the mere phrase single-Chamber Government, because to the great intents and purposes of Government we are now under a single-Chamber system, and I read out from Mr. Balfour's address to his constituents in the City of London an enumeration, which was by no means a full or even an adequate enumeration, of the enormous powers now possessed and exercised without dispute or contention by the House of Commons. It is not disputed, in spite of what happened in November last, that the ultimate control of finance, the direction of taxation, and so forth, lie with the House of Commons, and even your Lordships, in your action which I thought at the time, and still think, lamentable, did not mean to say more than that the voice of the people should be heard. It was not contended that your Lordships had any right or power, for example, to amend a Finance Bill, and you only rejected the Finance Bill because you were not sure that the country's views had been heard upon it, or that the country's mind was in favour of it. Not one of your Lordships, not even those who take most high-flying views of what ought to be the powers of a Second Chamber, would say that you have the right to or could displace an Executive Government. I only want you to remember how far you have already gone, and where you stand in respect of single-Chamber Government. It seems to me that it would be quite impossible to look forward
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0235"/>
<col>419</col>
to the time when you could hope, as you are doing by this Motion of my noble friend, by some process of attrition to lessen the powers of the House of Commons so long as that House retains the authority of removing or appointing the Executive Government, and so long as it retains the whole control of the taxation of the country and of all Government affairs. The Foreign Secretary and the Cabinet may take a most disastrous step in foreign policy. Your Lordships may condemn it. The Foreign Secretary, no doubt, would regret that, but it would make no difference to the course of policy actually being carried out. Those are a few of the undisputed powers possessed by the House of Commons. I could go through the whole catalogue, but I only rose to correct the noble Marquess in the representation he gave of what I said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00844"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: May I say one word in answer to what has fallen from the Government Bench? There is no idea in this very innocent Resolution to alter in any way either by attrition or by any other process the powers of the House of Commons. I have not arrived, nor have noble Lords who sit behind me, however young they may be, at that time of life to be able to credit those who sit in this House with such a degree of sagacity as might imply an attempt to diminish the powers of the House of Commons. I venture to say that that idea has never occurred to a single man in this House. Then, on the question of foreign policy. The noble Viscount thinks that the Foreign Secretary or the Cabinet might embark on the most daring flight of foreign policy without the control of this House. So they might without the control of the House of Commons. There is nothing whatever in that suggestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00845"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: If he did a Vote of Censure would be moved, and if the Party of noble Lords opposite were strong enough it would be carried and he would be dismissed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00846"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: Any Minister would be equally under the censure of the House of Commons, but as it happens I think that the Foreign Minister of this country is more independent of Parliament in his acts than any other Minister that exists. For all we know the Foreign Minister at this moment may be entering into an agreement of which we shall never hear, or may not
<col>420</col>
have an idea for months and years, and when we do he may be far beyond the criticism of the House of Commons. If my noble friend will examine his own proposition he will see that it does not extend beyond this, that any Minister who undergoes the censure of the House of Commons, whatever his Department may be, must necessarily disappear. It is not confined to the control of foreign affairs. If my noble friend looks back over past years he will find that all the principal debates on foreign affairs have taken place in this House, and that it is only owing to the great principle of the continuity of foreign policy that those debates do not occur here now. I venture to say that if those debates did take place in this House now they would be quite as influential and as eagerly read in the country as debates in the House of Commons. Now I come to another class of idea. I only rose entirely to deny such an insane and preposterous idea that it is in the thought of anybody here to desire to limit the powers and functions of the House of Commons. If I may say so, our intentions are rather of a preservative and defensive character. I heard with some astonishment from the Government Benches of all places in the world that there is some ambiguity in the proposition I have ventured to set out that a strong and efficient Second Chamber is necessary to balance the Constitution. I cannot conceive a proposition so absolutely free from ambiguity as the one embodied in the Resolution. From whom does the charge of ambiguity come? From a Government every member of which whenever he speaks expresses a different view of policy on the question of a Second or a Single Chamber, and from whom we have laboriously to gather stick by stick the faggot of Government policy. I do not attach so much importance as the noble Marquess did to the speech of the Home Secretary the other day. The Home Secretary said that so far as he was personally concerned he felt no great apprehension at the thought of a Single Chamber. I think that in far-away days I heard something of the same kind from the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India. That is what we call a pious opinion. But on the general proposition the Home Secretary sounded no uncertain note. We do not know what the propositions of the Government are, in spite of the Government constantly telling us. That is part of that freedom from ambiguity which is the boast on which the Government plume themselves
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0236"/>
<col>421</col>
The Home Secretary told us that the proposals of the Government are the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions stiffened up and fortified by the present Prime Minister. As the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions pulverised this House what remains for the Prime Minister to do in the way of strengthening and fortifying them is far beyond my comprehension. And this is the moment when we are asked in this Second Chamber, which is menaced with practical extinction by the Government, what right we have to put on our Journals a declaration that we think that a strong and efficient Second Chamber is necessary to the Constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00847"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may with deference say so, I do not understand how the views which the noble Viscount opposite has given us of the position of this House&#x2014;views which those of us who recognise his constitutional authority and have been accustomed to look to his name as our guide in many historical matters must recognise as being supreme&#x2014;I do not understand how his views as to the comparatively small powers now exercised by this Chamber can be consistent with his strong support of a policy which is destined to further weaken those powers; and I cannot understand how the views he holds can be reconciled with the views of his followers, and other sections who are not his followers but who are co-operating with His Majesty's Government, entirely against the principle or use of any Second Chamber at all. I hope that his followers and the allies of the Government throughout the country will take note of the strong views which the noble Viscount holds as to the present functions of the House of Lords and that we shall not hear any more in the country of the extravagant assumption of powers, which is the foundation of the whole campaign against the House of Lords at this moment&#x2014;the assumption that this Chamber is endeavouring to arrogate to itself powers which the noble Viscount says we do not arrogate. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has criticised the noble Earl on the Cross Benches because he has not put down in detail on the Paper the full plan of what he proposes to do. Surely the noble Earl gave a very fair indication of the main outlines on which he proposed to work. Surely these three preliminary Resolutions supply a clear and succinct proposition of the beginnings of this movement, and the procedure the noble Earl is adopting bears a very close similarity to the procedure which
<col>422</col>
the Government are themselves adopting. I understand that His Majesty's Government propose to proceed by Resolution in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00849"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to hear from the noble and learned Lord that we shall have something explicit from His Majesty's Government, but I venture, with all due deference, to express the opinion that whatever may be said about the Resolutions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches they are at least explicit. It is perfectly clear what they mean, and if the Government, with all the resources at their disposal, choose to proceed by Resolution, I do not see why the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, who has not got those resources at his command, should be criticised for proceeding by exactly the same method and laying on the Paper these clear and concise expressions of opinion. I support the Resolution with all the strength in my power. Though noble Lords opposite support, and though, as I understand, His Majesty's Government support, the attribute "strong and efficient" for a Second Chamber, they must realise&#x2014;every member of this House must realist&#x2014;that there is a section of the community in this country which not only desires that the Second Chamber should not be strong and efficient, but that it should not exist at all; and it is something that, with the general consent of all parties in this House, there should be placed upon our Journals the opinion that there should exist a Second Chamber of a strong and efficient character.</membercontribution></p>

I have no desire to offer any definite opposition to this Resolution, but before giving a whole-hearted adhesion to it I confess I should like to see the plan. We have heard a great number of plans outlined, but it has not been shown that a satisfactory Second Chamber&#x2014;without dwelling once more on the possible meanings which can be given to the words "strong and efficient"&#x2014;can best be obtained by the reform and reconstitution of the House of Lords. Those terms are very wide, and before giving adhesion to them I should like to know what the precise plan is. I think this Resolution is open to the charge of putting the cart before the horse. I have, however, no desire on behalf of my noble friends to offer any opposition to it, but I do not think this is one of the cases where a general proposition is of much value, because everything depends upon the precise nature of the Chamber which you propose to create.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE THIRD RESOLUTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00855"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the third Resolution&#x2014;
<quote>"That a necessary preliminary of such reform and reconstitution is the acceptance of the principle that the possession of a Peerage should no longer of itself give the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords,"</quote>
I desire to take the opinion of your Lordships as to your own convenience. As to the first and second Resolutions, I had no doubt whatever that your Lordships would pass them practically without discussion, because, after all, they are maxims which, whatever my noble friends on the opposite Bench may say, are practically incontrovertible, I think, to the vast majority of persons inside this House. I did not desire to prolong the discussion on the second Resolution, because I was anxious to get both Resolutions through with as little discussion as possible&#x2014;a practical measure which I am sure would recommend itself to my noble friends in every part of the House. But I must not allow it to be supposed that I pass without demur the proposition of my noble friend the Leader of the House that because I and those who agree with me think that a strong and efficient Second Chamber could best be found by the reform and the reconstitution of the House of Lords we are bound thereby at once to table a detailed plan of reform and reconstitution. In the enormously
<col>424</col>
long and dreary speech which I delivered in bringing forward these Resolutions, I detailed very carefully the course of action we proposed to take. It was not for me as an individual in any way whatever to bring forward a detailed scheme. It was no part of my plan that I should put myself forward as the reformer of this House. I wished only to act as the mouthpiece, the agent, as it were, of the House, in reconstituting and reforming itself, and therefore I urged upon your Lordships that you should proceed slowly in this matter, so that every Resolution might be carried, as the first two have been, with the almost universal assent and support of the House. I hope that the course the House will pursue will be the one which was recommended on that occasion&#x2014;that, not being able to produce a Bill, as the Government are able, for the reconstitution of this House, not being in that position of official authority, the House should confine itself to passing broad Resolutions of principle on which it thinks the reform of this House should proceed, and on which, when a Government able to deal with the question in both Houses shall have come into power, they may found a Bill. I believe that that view of the strategy of the situation recommended itself to this House, and I hope your Lordships will pursue it. But I demur altogether to the idea that because we have passed these two Resolutions, which I think are of an unquestionable and innocent character, we are at once bound to lay detailed schemes on the Table. The Government, after meditations of many months, possibly years, on this subject&#x2014;the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions were passed some years ago&#x2014;have not yet found themselves in a position to lay any plan at all. That we, three weeks after the commencement of the session in which first we began to move, should be required by the Government to do this thing which they themselves, in all this time, have hitherto been unable to do, strikes me as going a little beyond the equities of the situation. What I do invite on this present occasion is an expression of opinion from the House as to whether we should proceed with the third Resolution now, or to-morrow, or the day after, or immediately after the Easter recess. Whichever course the Government wish to adopt will be agreeable to me&#x2014;I mean, whatever course the House may wish to adopt, a very broad distinction.</membercontribution></p>

<col>425</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00856"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not rise immediately after my noble friend because I hoped that some member of the House on the Benches behind me would have something to say on this particular point. As far as I am myself concerned I subscribed to the third Resolution when I was a member of the Committee presided over by the noble Earl. Therefore I am committed to it and I am prepared to subscribe to it again whenever necessary. But as the noble Earl I think truly said, this is a matter in which the convenience of the House generally ought to be considered. I have endeavoured, with such opportunities as presented themselves, to make inquiries as to the general feeling amongst noble Lords who sit on this side. I cannot pretend to say I have ascertained what the universal feeling amongst them is, but I have certainly been made aware of a widespread desire that the third Resolution, which is regarded, rightly or wrongly, by many of my friends as more controversial than the first two, should not be taken immediately&#x2014;that is, not to-day or tomorrow. Whether it would be more convenient to take it next week, immediately after the short holiday which I understand is to be accorded to us, or at the beginning of the following week, I really do not know. Either date, so far as I am concerned, would suit me perfectly, but it may be more convenient that the third Resolution should not be taken till either the 30th instant or the fourth of next month.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00857"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I suggest that, if the general convenience of the House is to be consulted, surely the simplest plan would be to go on with the Resolution now. This Resolution may be extremely disagreeable to many members of this House, but it will not be any less disagreeable if it is taken next week instead of the present; and I venture to suggest, if we really are going to consider our own convenience, it would be more appropriate to go on with the Resolution now. We have plenty of leisure, whereas if it is put off we shall be brought back next week for the purpose of discussing a thing which we could perfectly well discuss at the present moment; and it is possible, in view of the extremely uncertain condition of affairs at the present time, that we might have a General Election sprung upon us before we had come to a decision
<col>426</col>
at all on this matter, and where should we be then?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00858"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entertain a strong view that we ought not to go on with the third Resolution now. I cannot pretend to have gauged the opinions of all members who sit on this side of the House, but certainly a considerable number of them were of opinion that it would be inexpedient and undesirable to proceed with this Resolution at the present moment. The two first Resolutions might well be passed without any hesitation. They are pious opinions, and I can quite understand, particularly after the explanation of the noble Earl the Leader of the House, that they may be understood very much according to the taste of the person who has got to interpret them. But certainly I am not prepared to discuss now and to dispose of the question of the right of a Peer to succeed to his father at the tail of this discussion. I think we require a little more consideration. It is not desirable, upon a question so important, that this Resolution should be passed like the preliminary Resolutions and that we should get rid of a constitution of this House which has existed for some centuries by a discussion of some minutes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00859"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the discussion will be proceeded with now. There are a number of noble Lords who are not here primarily as politicians, but who do take an interest in the debates of your Lordships' House, and who give a great deal of their time to the business in their various counties. This is a very busy time of the year; and if you do not proceed with this Resolution to-day or to-morrow, I venture to say that you cannot, if you wish to have a full House, get on with it for another fortnight. County Council meetings, Quarter Sessions, and the Territorial Association meetings are all taking place within the next fortnight. I do not know whether it is generally known, but eighty per cent of the chairmen of the County Territorial Associations are members who sit on this side of the House, although we have been told at different times that Peers are no good for business or anything eke. Those Peers cannot be absent from the meetings of the County Associations because there is no one who can take their place. I therefore do wish, if we are not to take the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0239"/>
<col>427</col>
consideration of the third Resolution now, that at any rate we shall know very distinctly when it is that the Resolution is to be brought on again. I myself hope that the House will be allowed to give its opinion pretty strongly now as to what it wishes. I cannot help thinking that the noble Marquess has only heard one side of the case. So far as I am concerned, since I have been here I have heard only one opinion, and that is that it is a great pity to waste time, and that it is quite possible, if we do waste time now, we may never get an opportunity again of considering the third Resolution because we may have a General Election sprung upon us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00860"><member>LORD STANMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there is one point on which your Lordships may be said to be generally agreed, it is that the number of Peers attending as legislators should be diminished. Now, how can that diminution possibly be effected without some restriction of the hereditary principle? It seems to me that those who think, as I believe almost the whole House does, that we should limit our numbers must consent to some limitation of the hereditary principle, and therefore I cannot see why the third Resolution should not be passed at once, seeing that it only proposes that the hereditary principle should not be the only and sole qualification for a seat in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00861"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it not be possible to take the opinion of the House on the special point whether we should proceed now or not? I endorse what Lord Heneage has said. I think it would be extremely inconvenient to a great many of us to be called up here again next week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00862"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe there are a good many of your Lordships who are anxious to proceed as quickly as possible in this important matter, but who at the same time have, either justly or unjustly, some doubt as to what the third Resolution would commit the House to. Those noble Lords who hold this opinion wish that the Resolution should be thoroughly discussed and that a hasty decision should not be come to upon it. I also signed the Report of the Committee, and I had my own idea as to what was meant. I think it would be unfortunate if there was any feeling that the
<col>428</col>
matter had been rushed to-day. At the same time we are all here now, and why the debate should not be commenced I cannot see.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00863"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I may say that I came down to the House with the idea that the general understanding was that only the first two Resolutions were to be taken this week. I may be wrong, but I am conscious of more than one Peer who had intended to take part in the debate but who was under the same impression. I feel that it is most important that the Resolution should not be passed without the most general assent that this House can command, and I deprecate proceeding at too great haste.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00864"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are two, or rather three, questions before the House&#x2014;first, whether we are to proceed now; secondly, whether we should proceed to-morrow, which I think would meet the objection of the noble Viscount who has just sat down; or, thirdly, whether we should adjourn the discussion until after the Easter holiday. On this particular question the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury, if he will allow me to say so, carries less weight with me than on most questions, for I think an unlimited postponement of this question would meet his views more completely than even a postponement until after Easter. If I may offer an opinion on a subject on which I did not mean to offer an opinion, I do not think it would be quite fair to many Peers to proceed with the third Resolution and conclude the discussion to-night. I know one or two noble Lords who meant to speak on this third Resolution and who put off coming up until to-morrow. It is for the House to decide whether they will go on with the Resolution to-morrow or postpone it until after the Easter holidays. [Opposition cries of "To-morrow" and "Now."] I am glad in the circumstances that I am not leader of either side of the House. But to bring the matter to a head, I beg to move that we take the third Resolution tomorrow.</membercontribution></p>

I support the noble Earl, and I hope your Lordships will agree to postponing the commencement of the discussion until to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00868"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may have rather a bad effect if, after passing the two somewhat colourless Resolutions which we have already adopted, we should appear to shirk the discussion of the third Resolution. I do not think it is very material whether we go on to-day or tomorrow, but I think it might have a very bad effect in the country if it appeared that we were going to postpone the discussion on the noble Earl's first important Resolution until after the Easter holidays, especially when, as has been already remarked, the state of political affairs is such that we do not know when a crisis may occur. Whether we commence the discussion of this Resolution now or tomorrow, I would urge that we should enter upon it before the Easter recess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00869"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very unwilling to intervene; but I confess it does seem to me somewhat singular, in view of the unusually crowded state of the House as compared with its ordinary condition, that this debate should not be proceeded with now. As to the time when it ought to be concluded I express no opinion, but I confess I do not see precisely what would be gained by the adjournment of the discussion until to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00870"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the proposal is that the discussion of the third Resolution should be commenced, but that it should not be finally disposed of until to-morrow. That is a compromise which does not commend itself to me, for this reason. We understand that there are a certain number of noble Lords who desire to take part in this debate, but who were under the impression&#x2014;how derived I do not know&#x2014;that the third Resolution would not be taken to-night. Considering that we are
<col>430</col>
dealing with the interests of a great number of members of this House who see themselves threatened with a deprivation of their hereditary rights, I think the least we can do is to give those noble Lords a few hours more, if they desire it, in order that they may hear the whole of the discussion that the third Resolution may give rise to, and, if necessary, take part in it. I do not see what we should gain by beginning the discussion this evening and carrying it on to-morrow. Therefore, if we have to divide between that proposal and the proposal to adjourn and begin the third Resolution to-morrow, I shall vote for adopting the latter course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00871"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was far from my wish to impose any view on the House, and for the reason that I have no knowledge how long this debate is likely to last. It seems to be in the mind of the noble Marquess opposite that if it was started to-day it would be certain to be finished to-morrow. I do not know how many of your Lordships will desire to speak, how many noble Lords will wish to say <i>morituri te salutant</i>, but I think they should have an opportunity of doing so, and, if possible, of choosing their own day. If the noble Marquess is right in thinking that the debate is not likely to take more than two afternoons, I should withdraw my proposition to proceed at once on the grounds stated by the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0005P0I0242"/>
<col>433</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00882">VISCOUNT RIDLEY said: My Lords, I demur to this proposition being put through without debate. I am perfectly certain there are a great many who would have desired to express an opinion upon it, and who have not had an opportunity for one reason or another. Although those members who served on the Committee which made certain recommendations as regards your Lordships' House arrived at general conclusions, one of which was practically the embodiment of the noble Earl's third Resolution, yet to commit the whole House to it is committing it to a very considerable proposition, which really is the beginning of all the reforms which must or may bring this House into more direct touch, if that be desired, with what is called the democracy. I speak, if I may, for myself, because the other day the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition expressed the greatest solicitude for the fate of those Peers who, as a result of the suggested plan of reform, might be excluded from this House in the future. Every scheme which I have seen, and every plan which I have had an opportunity of looking at, would have excluded my humble self from being of necessity a member of your Lordships' House, and I should have had to take my chance. Notwithstanding that, I feel so strongly that there is a need, and an immediate need, of reform which will bring a fresh current of air into this House that I can assure the noble Marquess that the scheme which he has outlined does not in the least alarm me. It is realised by your Lordships that the membership of this House is too large for effective debate, that there should be opened to it sources of fresh inspiration which at present are denied to it, and although no friend of this House would desire it to have acted in any other way than it has done, although we may believe fully that the existence and the actions of this House have justified the hereditary principle to the full, yet it needs to be more deeply rooted in the general confidence of the people than it is at the present moment. We need to be stronger in the sense, not of containing stronger or more efficient numbers, but in the sense of being stronger in the confidence of the people. That is why I am anxious to see this fresh current of air introduced. When on subsequent occasions the noble Earl places, as I gather he will do, further Resolutions on the Table, that, I suppose, would be the more appropriate time to discuss any suggested details. But I do
<col>434</col>
venture to express one hope, and that is that when proposals as regards the election of any Peers of Parliament from any source are put forward, due consideration will be had to safeguarding the status and the position of such Peers as can be elected. I am very anxious that the hereditary principle, which has worked well in practice, should form the main feature still of the constitution of this House. I trust that this third Resolution will command a wide and general acceptance in the House, because it is necessary at this stage of the twentieth century that we should march with the time. I sincerely hope that Lord Rosebery will lose no time in putting upon the Table Resolutions, so that the House may proceed at once to discuss the main outlines of the plan which may form the basis of future legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00883"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KILLANIN</member> had given notice to move to add at the end of the Resolution the words "to those who hereafter succeed to Peerages or who are created Peers." The Resolution, as proposed to be amended, would read&#x2014;
<quote>"That a necessary preliminary of such reform and reconstitution is the acceptance of the principle that the possession of a Peerage should no longer of itself give the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords to those who hereafter succeed to Peerages or who are created Peers."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00884">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have ventured, with considerable hesitation, to put on the Paper an Amendment to the noble Earl's Resolution. I hesitated to do so, not because I doubted the merits of my proposal, but because I felt that your Lordships might possibly think it presumptuous on my part to put down an Amendment at all to these important Resolutions. I am encouraged, however, to move my Amendment because the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, has invited us, especially us backwoodsmen, to give full expression to our views on the matter. I will therefore rely upon your Lordships' indulgence while I endeavour to give some reasons for the Amendment which I put down.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00885">The meaning of the Amendment is pretty clear. It is that, in my opinion, it would be wiser and also juster, in bringing about reform in this House, not to interfere with the existing House. I will give your Lordships some of my reasons for that view. In the interests of the good name of this House and of its Parliamentary authority and responsibility, I cannot for my part
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0243"/>
<col>435</col>
adopt the Resolution of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, because it seems to me that, if we agree with that Resolution, we are confessing our own legislative un-worthiness; we are, to a large extent, condemning ourselves as a House of Parliament, and saying in effect that a number of us ought no longer to be in this House. I think that that is a very dangerous proposition for us at this time of day to adopt, and one that is not true. We should remember that when this Resolution, which the noble Earl proposes, was originally passed in the Select Committee, over which he presided, it was merely an abstract general statement, with which all noble Lords might probably have agreed, and with which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, as he says, agreed; but I do submit to your Lordships that it is a very different thing when that abstract general statement comes before you as a specific, substantive proposal which you are asked to adopt as applicable to this living, acting House to-day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00886">I think that this is a very different situation, and that you cannot adopt this Resolution as it stands without announcing to the British public and to the world that in your opinion a number of the members of this House are unfitted to be legislators. ["No, no."] In the course of the debate last week, the noble Earl and the noble Lords, Lord Curzon and Lord Newton, said most distinctly that, if this Resolution were passed and legislation, based on it, followed, it would mean that a considerable number of your Lordships would be relieved of your duties in this House as being "black sheep" ["No, no."] or "undesirables" ["No."] or some such term. Those were the most flattering designations I heard. That was to be the necessary effect of this Resolution as interpreted by its leading supporters. Some said one-fifth should go, some one-half. I therefore submit as a proposition, which I shall be glad to hear refuted, that your Lordships cannot adopt the noble Earl's Resolution without thereby announcing that in your opinion a considerable number of your Lordships are unfit for your position as legislators and ought not to be any longer in this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00887">My Lords, I go further. If that is the state of affairs, if that is the character that you are going by this Resolution to give this House, that reflection will not merely apply to the <i>personnel</i> of this House to-day but it
<col>436</col>
will also apply to its actions three months ago and during the last few years. It is only three months since the House took a very important action, which was greatly criticised in various quarters. This House says it was right. I think the country has supported your Lordships in that action, but I think it will be a very curious commentary on the situation if the next step that this House takes is to say that the fact that we voted for or against the Budget was immaterial, and that the real truth is that we are not competent to a large extent to vote at all on any legislative question. The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, indeed analysed that subject in the course of his speech on the Budget. In the middle of that speech, he actually turned round to your Lordships and said that in his opinion the question was not whether we should vote for or against the Budget, but whether we were fitted to vote at all on the matter. I remember the noble Earl making that as his most practical suggestion as to the course which should be followed in reference to the Budget. [The Earl of ROSEBERY dissented.] The noble Earl does not think he said so, but my recollection is that he did. However, the noble Earl now comes forward with his proposition, and I do submit that you cannot pass it without taking into account the effects of so doing which were clearly described by the noble Earl and by Lord Curzon and Lord Newton in their speeches last week, the consequences of your action and the inferences that will be drawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00888">That is my main objection&#x2014;and I think it is an important objection&#x2014;to the adoption of this Resolution as it stands on the Paper. I do not agree with that condemnation of the existing House which it involves, but it will be most certainly turned against you by your enemies. I think it is a libel, but it will be used against you, and it will be said that you have declared that a great number of the members of this House are really not fitted to legislate at all. That is my main objection. But I have other objections to the Resolution of the noble Earl as it stands. If a number of noble Lords are to be eliminated, are to be given notice to quit, the next question one comes to consider is this. Are the modes by which this elimination is to be carried out likely to lead to satisfactory results? I am perfectly certain that if noble Lords on this side of the House, or in any part of the House, thought that it was for the good of the country to give up
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0244"/>
<col>437</col>
their rights and privileges, they would be willing to do so; but I think the suggested modes would not be satisfactory and would even be injurious.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00889">In the course of last week's debate two ways were suggested by means of which the numbers of this House were largely&#x2014;some said to the extent of one-half&#x2014;to be reduced. One was by the test of qualifications, and the other by means of selection amongst the Lords themselves. With reference to qualifications, I do not see that that would work well. It would result, I believe, in some being included who ought to be excluded, and <i>vice versa</i>. I think it is a preposterous suggestion in the case of a living, existing House to set up arbitrary lists of qualifications and then march about testing members as to whether they have ever been, say, Governor of Ceylon, and, if they have not, telling them that they must go. A noble Lord in reply to the question might say: "No, I was not Governor of Ceylon, but I was offered the position and refused it." You would have to say, "You must ome out; you have had no official experience." Are you to ask noble Lords whether they have been in the House of Commons? One might say he had. Another might say he had not, but that he had stood twice, and the second time was only beaten by sixteen votes in some big constituency. But he should go, because he had had no experience in the House of Commons. I believe that such a process of elimination in the case of an actual, existing Assembly would be misleading, inequitable, and invidious.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00890">As to the other method by which it is proposed to reduce the numbers of this House, by means of selection, I think it would be a most unfortunate principle to introduce. The great advantage of being an hereditary legislator is that you are dependent upon no electorate and nobody's vote for your seat. But if you introduce any form of selection you will at once impair, if not destroy, the independence of the members of this House; for unless a noble Lord is orthodox in every respect, unless he echoes whatever happens to be the dominant view of some league or caucus, he will not have the slightest chance, of being selected as a representative Peer. If the House puts a value on its political independence and wishes to preserve it inviolate, it will avoid this injurious mode of elimination.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00891">There is one other remark which I would like to make in support of my proposal.
<col>438</col>
I venture to submit that members of this House, as it is an existing body, have really some vested rights and privileges which should be respected. Noble Lords have not merely their rights and privileges; these also involve and have involved a number of duties and responsibilities which members have for the most part fulfilled in various ways. The mere fact that you have been a Lord of Parliament for a certain number of years has made you suffer also from limitations and disabilities, which have prevented you following other pursuits and other interests with honour and advantage. As Lords of Parliament you have been hampered and circumscribed in many directions. So that noble Lords have not alone got rights and privileges in this House; they are a counter part of duties and responsibilities and limitations. I submit that the vested rights and interests and privileges of any such members of this House ought not to be ignored.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00892">These are some of the reasons why I ventured to put down the Amendment standing in my name. I consider that these are reasons which ought to make this House very wary about interfering at all with the existing House. But it may be said, "Then you propose to do nothing?" I am far from proposing to do nothing. It is indeed because I am an advocate for reform that I see an additional reason for not interfering with the <i>personnel</i> of the present House. There is nothing that would more clear the ground and enable us to judge the question solely on its merits in a purely impersonal and unbiassed fashion and without having recourse to so injurious a process as selection or attempting to draw up arbitrary lists of qualifications than the fact that we had removed from consideration the question of the present House, and that we deliberately set to work to consider what reforms could nevertheless be carried out now or in the near future. It may be said that would be too slow. I do not agree. In so far as it would be gradual, I think that that would be a good thing. I am not in favour of sudden and ruthless reform. Unfortunately, also, mortality will thin our ranks only too quickly. Since this House has assembled two of our number have died. And assuming there were qualifications for successors to Peerages and for new Peers, the numbers of this House would be gradually, perhaps quickly, reduced. An elective element could also be introduced at nceo,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0245"/>
<col>439</col>
and a life Peer could be appointed, until a certain number were appointed, for every two vacancies that occurred in the hereditary Peerage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00893">As I have said, I cannot agree with the Resolution of the noble Earl as it stands, because I think it is based on a damaging and mischievous criticism and condemnation of this House, and I hope your Lordships will not adopt it. Furthermore, I think the suggested modes of reducing the numbers of this House will not conduce to the improvement of, but be injurious to the character of this House. If you avoided many unnecessary difficulties by not going into the question of the present House you would be able to do far more easily what is required&#x2014;namely, consider constructive reform for the future which would restrict indiscriminate hereditary additions to the House and which would introduce new blood into this House and bring it more in accord with modern requirements and ideas as regards legislative responsibility and authority. And so, this House, without sacrificing its prestige, and without condemning its past without too much speed and without being too slow, would go about the important task of renewing itself and readapting itself to the necessities of the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00894"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member><membercontribution>: I did not call upon the noble Lord to move his Amendment immediately after the Resolution, because in the way it appears on the Paper it is not, strictly speaking, an Amendment. It is an addition to the Resolution. But inasmuch as I think that whether these words are added or not might very largely influence some members of your Lordships' House as to the manner in which they would vote on the main Resolution, I suggest to the noble Lord that he should put it in the form of an Amendment by moving to insert the words of which he has given notice after the word "give." The Resolution would then read in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"That, a necessary preliminary of such reform and reconstitution is the acceptance of the principle that the possession of a Peerage should no longer of itself give to those who hereafter succeed to Peerages or who are created Peers the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords."</quote></membercontribution></p>

<quote>To insert, after the word "give," the words "to those who hereafter succeed to Peerages or who are created Peers."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Killanin.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00899"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I confess that as the mover of the Resolution I have no reason to complain of the tone in which the noble Lord has moved his Amendment, but I cannot honestly advise your Lordships to accept it. The noble Lord's arguments, I think, are rather of a kind that would not look well if exposed nakedly to the country as the views of your Lordships. I heard him speak in the debate last week, and therefore I was not surprised altogether to see his Amendment on the Paper. He used the expression "vested interests" rather freely on that occasion, and also again to-night. I am bound to say that if it goes to the country that the House of Lords considers that, whatever the effect may be on the country, a Peer has a vested interest in the right to legislate, it will have rather a damaging appearance. We sit here, presumably, for the good of the country and if in our opinion it is well that we should divest ourselves of certain hereditary rights for the good of the is not pleasant, I think, to consider ourselves as a going concern for the goodwill of which we must require some compensation.<lb/>
The noble Lord has completely misunderstood the basis upon which this Resolution rests. He says it is a reflection upon the present constitution of your Lordships' House, but I am wholly unconscious, at any rate, of any such reflection. He says that Lord Curzon and myself last week used the words "black sheep" and "undesirables." Well, I spoke a long time, and I cannot swear to every syllable I may have used, but I am totally unconscious of having touched upon that line of argument at all. It was not in my mind. The object of the limitation of the hereditary principle, at least, one of the objects, was the limitation of numbers, and though the noble Lord holds out to us the genial prospect of a speedy reduction by death and intimated that two Peers have already been taken from us in the course of this session, I think that is not the most attractive view to take of the subject. The noble Lord made great play with the Report of the Select Committee, and said it was all very
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0246"/>
<col>441</col>
well when it was merely a Resolution in Committee, but it was a very different thing bringing it forward as a substantive proposition. I ask what is the idea of the noble Lord about the good faith of the Committee that passed that Resolution. Does he think it a sort of valentine, or that the Committee honestly believed what was stated in the Resolution and were prepared to bring it forward at the first opportunity. Then the noble Lord brought forward another argument. It was that this was a reflection upon the action of your Lordships in voting for the Resolution of my noble friend the noble Marquess on the Budget in the course of last November. I quite admit I did not think that a judicious proceeding, but I do not see how it enters into the consideration of the present matter at all. The Resolution on the Paper is avowedly founded on the Resolution of the Select Committee, and that Resolution was passed eighteen months before the Resolution of the Marquess of Lansdowne was placed on the Paper, and at least a year before the Budget was introduced. Therefore if any of your Lordships feel any trepidation in voting for this Resolution on the ground that it implies any reflection upon your conduct in voting for Lord Lansdowne's Resolution, you may dismiss that from your minds with perfect ease. I do most earnestly hope that the House will not entertain this Amendment to the Resolution, because I think nothing could be more damaging to our credit in the country than the idea that it was considered that we had a vested interest in the legislation of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00900"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid I do not altogether agree with my noble friend who has just spoken, nor can I altogether support the view of the noble Lord who preceded him. I am, however, not afraid to speak of the vested interests of your Lordships. You have a right to sit in this House, and I do not very well understand the difference between a vested interest and a right. But when we come to the question of how far we should claim or waive that right for the public advantage, that, I think, is a very different matter. I must say I should be very unhappy, indeed, if I thought that your Lordships' House, with its great traditions, and its reputation for consideration of the public service before everything, were to begin to haggle when you are considering whether it is or is not necessary for the public good that your number should be
<col>442</col>
reduced, whether each individual seat should be retained or not.<lb/>
It seems to me a very curious position which the noble Lord has set up. We are to be sensitive of our own vested rights; this House is to be unable to move until mortality has thinned our ranks and paved the way to further reform, but the rights of posterity do not matter at all. Those who come after may take care of themselves. I should be sorry to take such a view, and I beg leave to altogether dissociate myself from it. I beg you particularly to allow me to emphasise that, because of what I am going to say in a moment a little bit on the other side. I do not know whether I am a "backwoodsman" or not, because I have never yet heard a definition of that term. There were many propositions put forward as qualifications before the Committee which sat on this subject. Under some of them, I believe, I should be qualified, and by others I should not. But my vote will certainly not be governed by any desire to retain a seat in this House for a longer time than the House as a whole thinks it to the public advantage that I should do so.<lb/>
Having said so much on the Amendment immediately before us, perhaps I may be allowed to say one word with regard to the wording of the noble Earl's Resolution. I cannot help thinking it is unfortunate in one respect. It lays down that the possession of a Peerage should no longer "of itself give the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords." I cannot help thinking that it would have been more logical, more respectful to your Lordships' House, and more constitutional if the wording had run thus:&#x2014;"That the right to sit and vote should not be exercised by certain Peers in this House." That is a very different thing from saying that a man shall not exercise the right. Your Lordships have, I believe, at the present moment a perfect right, an inherent right, to vote in this House by proxy, but you determined by Resolution not to exercise that right. I believe that in theory every member of this House has a right to take a part in the Judicial proceedings of the House, but we know perfectly well that the House would not permit lay Lords to do any such thing. I protest against the wording of the Resolution, which implies that you are going to take away an actual right which has been handed down to us by the unwritten Constitution. It is a totally unnecessary degree of change. You
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0247"/>
<col>443</col>
may effect all that you want to achieve by a Resolution depriving certain Peers of the right to exercise their vote or to occupy their seats.<lb/>
As to the main result at which we want to arrive, I have no hesitation in saying that there cannot be two opinions in the mind of any one who has really considered the subject that the substance of the noble Earl's Resolution is an absolute necessity if anything is to be done in the way of reform. In the first place, I really do not know why we should be afraid of saying that there are some members of this House&#x2014;no doubt a very small number&#x2014;who, for many reasons, as I ventured to say the other night, are not desirable persons as legislators. My defence of the present House&#x2014;I mentioned this the other night and I repeat it now to round off my argument&#x2014;has been that those undesirables, if we are to call them so, never really affected the decisions of this Chamber upon important questions. But it is impossible to deny that they exist. They may, as I say, be very small in number; but your Lordships would be in a better position if you were able to say to the whole world, and to those people in the country who do not understand the working of this House, that there are no undesirable members who can join in legislation. If we can do that by excluding such members, by all means let us do so.<lb/>
Then there is another aspect of this question. I think your Lordships are pretty unanimously of opinion that this House is too large. There is no restriction in regard to additions to the number of its members, and, as we all know, every Government seems to be more and more prolific in recommending the creation of new Peers to His Majesty. It is perfectly evident that if this is to go on, this House will become totally unwieldy. We see what it is in the House of Commons. The House of Commons is far too large for the proper transaction of its business. It is getting pretty nearly the same size as this House, although owing to the attendance here being less, we are not quite so unwieldy as the Lower House. But there is a third reason why we must adopt some Resolution of this kind, and that is the great evil, which both sides of the House admit, of the unbalanced character of political Parties in this Chamber. I am not altogether sure, my Lords, that some of us on this side of the House are not even more anxious than noble Lords opposite to see
<col>444</col>
the two sides of the House more equal. I can assure noble Lords opposite that debating with very little reply is by no means an easy thing, and I cannot help thinking that our debates would be very much more lively if there were a larger number of noble Lords sitting opposite. But that is a very small matter compared to the importance and authority which this House would gain if the two Parties were more equal. For all these reasons I think that the noble Earl's Resolution, although I do not quite like its wording, is, in essence, absolutely necessary for us to adopt.<lb/>
I do trust, my Lords, that we shall adopt the Resolution and deal with the whole question from a public point of view. Do not let us be thinking whether or not A or B or C is going to retain his seat. Let us reform this House so that certain classes of noble Lords whom we think it desirable should have seats should retain them. We have all got our own opinions. If your Lordships will give me leave at some future time I shall venture to express my own as to whether qualification or election is the better plan, and how much qualification there should be and how much election. All these will be questions which will arise later on. As to what is called "letting in fresh air"&#x2014;I do not quite know what that means, but it is one of those vague similies which, however poetic, do not help us very much to understand what their authors mean&#x2014;I suppose it implies that we are to look outside this House for additions to its numbers. All these questions will come up for discussion later. Let them be considered from a national standpoint, having in view what will be best for the nation, and above all let us not adopt, as we would do by passing the Amendment, an attitude which would certainly be accepted by the country to mean that we place the enjoyment of our own seats and whatever dignity may be attached to those seats before the interests of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00901"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe, that by the rules of your Lordships' House the debate ought to be confined to the Amendment of the noble Lord below the Gangway. Although there is a great deal in what the noble Lord said, I could not help feeling, when he argued that what has been proposed is simply a confession of unworthiness on the part of a great many of your Lordships, that he carried his argument beyond what is reasonable or what will commend itself to your Lordships.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0248"/>
<col>445</col>
There are inherent disadvantages in this House from which we may, perhaps, free it, but I will always contend that it has done its duty well, and that it is one of those institutions which are of great practical value to the country.<lb/>
Several attacks are made upon your Lordships' House. There is the accusation that owing to the strong preponderance of Conservative feeling Liberal measures coming from the other House are never properly and fairly debated; that measures coming from a Conservative House of Commons are taken practically without comment, while those sent by a Liberal House of Commons are either rejected or so seriously altered that it is considered to be an injustice. No doubt this is a point of great importance and one which should not be lost sight of. I should like to mention one disadvantage in this House, a disadvantage which I do not think has been much noticed in the Press or in public discussion, and that is that it contains a good many noble Lords&#x2014;I cannot say exactly how many, but I suppose a good few&#x2014;who are, so to speak, members against their will. They take no interest in public life and are put in a place which they cannot properly adorn and in which they cannot make use of the talents they possess. If by any means we could get rid of those without giving offence and without prejudice, we should have gone some distance towards reforming this House. That is one of the things to be aimed at instead of debating the Amendment of my noble friend, which would not interfere with the present hereditary Peerage at all.<lb/>
I should like to see, if possible, a list made out of the membership of your Lordships House as it stands at present, and then that, in some way or another, word should be sent round practically to every Peer asking whether he would like to go on serving in this House should be be elected, or selected, or in any way appointed. I think you would find&#x2014;I may not be correct in what I say&#x2014;but I think you would find a certain number who would be rather glad to be released from what is an untenable, and, perhaps, a somewhat disagreeable position. That would reduce your list to a certain extent. As to the remainder, if we could devise some system of selection, which I cannot help thinking is the right line to go on, that would, I think, be the simplest and the safest way out of the difficulty. And if it were possible that you could select an equal number of Peers from each side of the
<col>446</col>
House according to their political opinions you would have gone some way to redress the balance. If you fixed first of all how many Peers should be selected by their fellows and then laid down an equal number of the two sides to be elected, you could not really come to a deadlock, because it would be virtually impossible to have an equality of votes on any question, and, supposing you could carry this into practical effect, you would have the very great advantage of having serious political questions debated and settled by the views of moderate men of both sides. There is considerable difficulty in this, because you would have to do what I believe is rather foreign to the Constitution&#x2014;recognise officially what has never been recognised officially before, the difference between one Party and another If that difficulty could be met, I think a good deal of ground would be got over towards meeting what has no doubt a certain amount of truth in it, although much exaggerated&#x2014;I refer to the preponderance of one political Party in this House, which does give some colour to the accusation of partiality.<lb/>
As to the idea of bringing in what the noble Duke called "fresh air," by which I presume is meant members from outside, I suppose that is not germane to the present Resolution, although I should like to make one or two suggestions upon that head. Whether or not it is thought fit that outside members should be appointed, I bog leave to throw out the suggestion that the power which exists now in the Crown to appoint Peers, which has existed for so many years and which I think it would be a very dangerous thing to interfere with, should be retained in the appointment of any fresh outside elements into this House; and that instead of adopting all the dangers of election, whether it be direct or indirect election, you should strive to get out of the difficulty by preserving that most valuable right of the Crown to appoint members of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I think that the Resolution ought, on the whole, to meet with a favourable verdict at the hands of your Lordships. There may be one or two things in the wording of it which may not altogether commend them-selves to you, and which possibly might be altered. There may be, in the opinion of some, an idea that it goes too far, and in others that it does not go far enough. But I cannot help thinking&#x2014;and I wish to endorse to the full what fell from my noble
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0249"/>
<col>447</col>
friend the Duke of Northumberland just now on this point&#x2014;that we ought to look upon this great question from a national point of view and not from merely selfish considerations. I hope that will be the frame of mind in which all your Lordships will look upon this question, and I hope that in the course of the debate we shall hear various expressions from all sides of the House which will tend to elucidate this great matter. I should like to say that, on the whole, I would be willing as far as I can to support the general principle contained in this Resolution, and I trust that it may bear some fruit and lead to a solution of one of the most important questions of modern times.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00902"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, several arguments have been brought forward against the Amendment, but I think the most fundamental one is that if it was adopted it would entirely frustrate the whole object of the third Resolution, and the vast majority of your Lordships who agree with the proposition must vote against the Amendment. It is most important at this special stage, as in all subsequent stages, of the work we have before us that this House should present as unanimous a front as possible, and therefore I think it would be most unfortunate that, through any misunderstanding or lack of clearness of vision on the part of those who vote, there should be division in our counsels which might easily be removed. I venture to think that there is some danger, as regards this third Resolution, of such a result arising. The noble Duke who spoke just now suggested a verbal alteration which tended in this direction. Whether he meant that as a distinct recommendation to the noble Earl I do not know, but if in the course of the debate any doubt is made manifest the noble Earl might do well to consider if by any slight alteration of words greater clearness can be introduced.<lb/>
We do consider that the time has come when some limitation must be introduced to the present number of those who hold Peerages and exercise the right of attending debates in this House. That seems to me a very difficult result to achieve unless the proposition of the noble Earl is adopted. But there are some in this House, not without legal acumen, who say that by carrying this Resolution as at present worded we may be regarded as having gone further than is intended; that we may be regarded as
<col>448</col>
having practically abolished the whole hereditary principle. I certainly have never regarded that as the result of carrying this Resolution. We are aware that the Peerages of Scotland and Ireland are already limited in regard to the number of their members who exercise the right to attend our debates, but I have never heard that any of them had accepted the theory that they had abandoned the hereditary principle. It seemed to me, therefore, that when I signed the Report of the Committee which embodied this Resolution, we were in no way abandoning the hereditary principle, although for reasons of national importance we did think that the time had come when the full attendance of Peers should be restricted. Indeed, I thought it might have come, without any question of agitation in the country or desire of the House of Commons, from our own unwieldiness; that it might have been found necessary, especially in view of the fact that there are so many Peers who do not care very often to attend our debates, to come to some Resolution of this kind. I certainly maintain that I have not the slightest notion of supporting any proposition for the abolition of the hereditary principle if I support, as I have every intention of doing, the third Resolution moved by the noble Earl. At the same time I do hope that some means may be taken to make quite clear how far we are going in carrying this Resolution, otherwise I see a danger of divided counsels at the beginning and of a considerable number of Peers being greatly dissatisfied with what is being done, and saying that they have been rushed precipitately on a very important question. Even if the Resolution is disposed of without any large show of opposition, there might be an uncomfortable feeling and very likely recrimination behind it. I do not know if anyone is going to move an Amendment or take any course of that kind. But if it should be urged from any influential quarter that by adopting this Resolution we are sacrificing the whole theory of the hereditary principle and this House decides the Resolution without that point having been completely disposed of, it will be accepted throughout the country that the House of Lords did regard it as the abandonment of the hereditary principle; that it was put before them as being that, and that, in spite of this warning, they decided to support the Resolution. It is very desirable, indeed, that we should come to an early decision on this important question, for it would be very unfortunate that we should allow the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0250"/>
<col>449</col>
Easter recess to come upon us without having adopted this Resolution, especially as it is possible that we may be deprived of the opportunity of going forward with the beneficent work of legislative reform by incidents in another place. It is most desirable, therefore, that there should be no feeling in the background, either that it has been unduly rushed or that every clearness has not been afforded to enable your Lordships to see distinctly how far the Resolution carries us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00903"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LAKSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am under the impression that the point immediately before your Lordships is the Amendment of my noble friend, and I think that it should be disposed of. I trust he will forgive me if I plead with him and express the hope that he will not press it. I will not examine it at length, but obviously, if it were carried, it would have the effect of retarding indefinitely that reconstitution of this House to which your Lordships have already pledged yourselves by accepting the first two Resolutions. And apart from that, I think his Amendment is open to the criticism passed upon it by the noble Duke on the Back Bench, that it strikes what I would venture to describe as a wrong note on the present occasion. It strikes a note of what will be considered outside as a somewhat selfish regard for the&#x2014;I think the expression that was used was vested interests&#x2014;for the vested interests of noble Lords who have at present a seat in this House of Parliament. If we are to address ourselves to this question of House of Lords Reform with any prospect of enlisting the sympathy of the people of this country, we must, I think, divest ourselves of that idea, and set to work according to the best of our ability to carry out that reconstitution to which we are now committed upon lines most advantageous to the public welfare.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00905">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00906"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when, an hour ago, I voted for the continuance of the debate upon the present occasion I did so upon three grounds. The first was that I felt that if this House, after passing two self-appreciative Resolutions, were to adjourn at so early an hour, when a Resolution not quite so agreeable to the feelings of some of your Lordships was to be proposed,
<col>450</col>
our action might be misunderstood and misrepresented in the country. I also felt that if we postponed action until to-morrow the plea might then be raised that we were getting still nearer the Easter recess; and a strong appeal might be made to this House to postpone action until after Easter, which I personally should regret. I am very anxious that this Chamber should give a guarantee of good faith to the nation that it is in earnest in taking up the whole task of reform, whether some, of its features be pleasing or unpleasing to ourselves. It is impossible for us to shut our eyes to the fact that the life of the present Parliament is seriously menaced, and that we may not, as my noble friend behind me said, have much opportunity of discussing possible reforms of this Chamber within the limits of the present Parliament. It is quite obvious to us all that the real serious work of discussion will begin when the noble Earl on the Cross Benches introduces those detailed Resolutions which we are not only anxious to see ourselves but which we wish to see laid before the country in such a shape as may ultimately commend themselves to our judgment; and it is quite impossible to suppose that any Resolutions which my noble friend will lay before us can be passed without very serious and prolonged discussion, in which I hope a great many members of your Lordships' House will take part. I never wished, in voting for the continuance of the debate, to suggest that the Motion of the noble Earl should be voted upon to-night. I quite realise that there are many noble Lords who did not expect that so important a Resolution would be disposed of before dinner on the first night of the debate, and I can also understand that there may be many noble Lords in this House who may wish to wait until to-morrow in order to express their matured views upon it. I would therefore suggest, if your Lordships agree, that it might be well to adjourn the debate this evening and continue it to-morrow. I beg to move the adjournment of the debate.</membercontribution></p>

There are three reasons why I should be brief. The first is that as recently as August 5 last year your Lordships were good enough to give a Second Reading to this Bill; the second reason is that I have no wish to occupy the time and attention of the House in view of matters of greater moment which are to come before you; and the third, and perhaps the most important reason is that I understand that His Majesty's Government take a more favourable view of this Bill on this occasion than they did last year, and are willing to adopt one of the suggestions thrown out at that time and allow the Bill to be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses. This Bill, which is exactly the same as the one to which your Lordships gave a Second Reading last year, has three objects. The first is the adoption of the clause which has already been inserted in some forty Water Bills and which goes by the name of the Lord Chairman's Clause. The second is to amend the law with regard to underground water by providing that wherever private supplies are injured by the abstraction of water for public supply, by means of future works, the owner shall be entitled to compensation; and the third object is to provide that where, by means of future works, water is taken from any district for supply to communities outside that district, the district whence the water is taken and through which it is conveyed shall be entitled to demand a share of such water for its own needs upon terms to be agreed or fixed by the Local Government Board.

Bill.

They are only anxious, while attempting to redress this evil, that other difficulties should not be created. The Government have no intention of raising any objection to the Second Reading of this Bill, on the understanding that it should be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, which would be able to consider the matter generally. It is recognised that in this way the points at issue, which are of very great importance, will be carefully reviewed, and it is hoped that the result of the consideration of them by this Committee may lead to some practical proposals being made to put the matter on a satisfactory footing. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will read the Bill a second time and acquiesce in the appointment of a Joint Committee to consider it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00937"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> had the two following Questions on the Paper viz.:&#x2014;(1) To ask the Under-Secretary of State for War what additional cost would be incurred by granting separation allowance to all Territorial non-commissioned officers and men during the period of annual training; and whether he would consider the advantage of such a concession in view of the facts that the Territorial Force is at present largely composed of lads under twenty-one years of age; that the majority of working men, with wives and families, cannot afford to come out for fifteen days at one shilling a day, and that the younger married men, who would impart a certain amount of stability to the various units, are thereby lost. (2) To ask the Under-Secretary of State for War whether he is aware that great difficulty exists in drilling outlying companies and sections of Territorial battalions recruited in country districts owing to the present deficiency of sergeant-instructors; and whether, without laying down a fixed scale, it would not be possible to deal more liberally in respect to the provision of permanent staff to scattered units, taking each case on its own merits.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00938">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I desire to ask the noble Lord who represents the War Office in your Lordships' House whether he can give us any information as to the two Questions which I have placed upon the Paper. The first question affects the class of men who enlist in the Territorial Force. I think the time has arrived when some consideration should be given by the War Office as to whether they could not grant separation allowances to privates as well as to non-commissioned officers. At the present moment separation allowances are given to non-commissioned officers, who, as a matter of fact, are generally in a better position to provide for their families than are privates in the ranks. To the ordinary private the separation allowance is of great importance, and I hope the noble Lord will be able to inform us that the matter will be considered by the War Office. The second Question relates to the supply of non-commissioned officers of the permanent staff for the training of units. In a town you can manage with a small permanent staff, but in country districts with scattered battalions more instructors are badly wanted. I trust that the noble Lord will be able to state that the number of instructors will be increased.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0253"/>
<col>455</col>
I hope he will also be able to tell us, in reply to a Question of which I gave him private notice, whether the War Office will consider the desirability of increasing the amount now allowed to enable outlying sections to travel in to attend drills. I am certain that unless some consideration is shown to men attending drills after they have done a day's work, it will have a disastrous effect on recruiting.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00939"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to my noble friend's first Question, I am sorry that I have no means of obtaining information as to what it would cost to give separation allowances to all the married men in the Territorial Forces. We do not have any return either of the number who are married or of the number of children the married men have, but I can assure the noble Lord that it would cost a very large sum indeed. It would also lead to increased expenditure in another direction, because we do not give separation allowances to the privates in the Special Reserve, and I think they would be entitled to them and would eventually get them if the Territorial Force were granted these allowances. It is quite true that the non-commissioned officers who get the separation allowance are very often a class of men who are in much better circumstances and require the allowance much less than the privates, but we give it to the non-commissioned officers for a particular reason. We realised very clearly when the Territorial Force was first formed that we should have to exact a rather higher standard of efficiency from the non-commissioned officers than most of them had attained at that time, and we give a separation allowance to non-commissioned officers as a payment to them for what we expect to get from them, and what, as a matter of fact, we are getting from them, in the way of increased efficiency. We expect the non-commissioned officer to be a regular attendant at camp, to attend the whole fifteen days, to be prepared to go through courses and other forms of instruction during the non-training period, and generally to be prepared, even at a certain amount of sacrifice of his time, to make himself as efficient as he possibly can in the circumstances. I would point out that, after all, it is not altogether desirable, from any point of view you like, to have too many married men in a military force. If the Territorial Force does have to go to war, it is obviously desirable that you should cause as little
<col>456</col>
dislocation of business and as little distress as possible, and you do not want to have more men with wives and families dependent upon them falling in a war of that kind than you can help. Therefore you do not want to encourage a large number of married men to enrol. I agree that a certain number of married men are desirable. You get them whether you give a separation allowance or not. But as to encouraging a large number of married privates, I think that is an undesirable thing. Even in the Regular Army, where we do give separation allowances, there is a certain fixed establishment of married privates allowed. In the Infantry it is very small indeed, only three per cent., and it is only the men who are on the married establishment who get the separation allowance.<lb/>
With regard to the second Question, which deals with sergeant-instructors, we are quite aware that difficulties do exist in certain places with regard to these matters, and if we had nothing to consider but simply the drilling of these men it would be desirable in many ways to give more sergeant-instructors than we do at the present time. But there are certain very cogent reasons why we should not. Sergeant-instructors, taking into consideration their pay and allowances and the non-effective vote as well, cost, roughly, &#x00A3;160 a year each, and therefore we cannot be indiscriminate in serving them out. We have, as a matter of fact, had a Committee sitting on the question and considering very carefully all the cases that have been brought before us. We have revised the permanent staff no fewer than eight times; we have in the last two years increased the number of permanent staff allotted by nearly 400, and we are prepared now to reconsider any case which is brought to our notice by the military authorities with their recommendation that it should be considered. There is another objection. After all, we have to see that the man who goes for service on the permanent staff does not run any risk of deteriorating, and I think if you have a man who is told off for a considerable time in charge of a very small detachment which does not occupy anything like the whole of his time, who is away from his headquarters, as he would be in the case of an outlying detachment, and who is, therefore, not under supervision, you at any rate run the risk of that man deteriorating and not being so fit a soldier as he ought to be if he is to return to the Colours. But we do
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0254"/>
<col>457</col>
realise the importance of drilling these men who join outlying battalions. They are usually countrymen, whom it is very desirable to enlist. We sanction now drill stations where you can have headquarters and accommodation for anything over twenty men, and you can have drill stations, where expense of accommodation is not incurred, for almost any number you like. We leave that to the County Associations.<lb/>
We have taken another step in advance. I refer to the payment which is given to the County Associations to enable outlying sections to travel in to drill. We have in that carried out a promise which we gave to the Council of County Associations last year who brought this question to our notice. We have asked every County Association to inform us how many men they have at a distance from their headquarters. We have taken different distances. We have asked them for the number of men at a distance of from three to five miles, from five to ten miles, and so on, and having got these figures we have taken each county separately and given them a payment based on allowing each of those men to travel in six times a year to the headquarters of the squadron, or battery, or whatever it may be, for the purpose of drill. That comes to the same thing as giving more instructors, because it means that if the instructor cannot travel out to the men we are enabling the men to travel in to the instructor. In the case of each county that figure is a different one, based on the actual returns supplied by the county. I hope that the giving of that grant will enable the County Associations to bring these outlying men in to drill and will relieve the difficulty of adequately instructing men in outlying districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00940"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the noble Lord's answer to the question as to the separation allowance, I should like to inquire whether he could not ask the Secretary of State to take into consideration the question of granting separation allowances to a certain number of men in every battalion. There is very great difficulty in the Territorial Force in getting non-commissioned officers, and we are losing a great many men who would fill these ranks with very great advantage to the force by the fact that they leave on account of their being unable to get a separation allowance. While it might be inadvisable to give a separation allowance to every married man in a battalion, it would,
<col>458</col>
I conceive, be a very great advantage if a certain percentage besides the non-commissioned officers who have it at present were allowed the separation allowance, so that you might retain some of the men to whom I have referred. I hope the noble Lord will lay this point before the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00942"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Lord who replied was speaking for himself or for the War Office, but if it was the latter I think that some of his remarks are of a singularly disquieting character. He said that if the Territorial Force ever had to fight&#x2014;and remember the only possible circumstances in which they could fight would be the event of invasion&#x2014;the object of the authorities was, I understood him, that there should be as little inconvenience and as little disturbance of business as possible. Now, does the noble Lord or do the War Office really imagine that in the event of invasion it would not affect every man, woman, and child in this country? Do the War Office really imagine that if we were invaded it would not affect and dislocate the whole of the trade of this country? I think the matter is of importance, because if those are the views which are held officially they are views which must cause us very grave anxiety and concern.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00943"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I leave the noble Lord to draw his own inferences from what I said; but one thing is obvious, and that is that every man who has a wife and several children depending upon him and goes into the ranks and fights will cause more want and distress than if that man's place was filled by a single man.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00947">House again in Committee (according to order) to consider the best means of reforming its existing organisation so as to constitute a strong and efficient Second Chamber.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00948">[The EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00949">Debate on the Motion of the Lord Rosebery (<i>E. Rosebery</i>) to resolve, That a necessary preliminary of such reform and reconstitution is the acceptance of the principle that the possession of a Peerage should no longer of itself give the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords <i>resumed</i>.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00950"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to ask the indulgence of the House for a few minutes while I attempt to explain the reasons why I intend to vote for the Resolution of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, although I have no doubt that personally I should be one of the first persons who would be swept on to the dust-heap in consequence of the legislation founded on that Resolution. But, my Lords, I am no sudden convert to the cause of the reform of your Lordships' House. I am not seeking refuge under the noble Earl's umbrella because I am frightened at the rumble of the approaching storm presaged by the Resolutions announced by His Majesty's Government for destroying all the existing powers of this House. I am supporting the Resolution of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches because I am one, I believe, of a very large number of noble Lords on this side of the House who have for many years past, or for a good many years past at all events, been convinced that a moderate reform of this House was an essential to enable us to retain in the country the full respect of the electorate and to act as that strong and efficient Chamber, a faith in which your Lordships pledged yourselves to unanimously under the second Resolution that was passed yesterday.<lb/>
In common with a very large body of opinion throughout the country, I am convinced that in order for this House to remain strong and efficient two things are necessary&#x2014;first, that an element of further strength shall be added; and, secondly, that an element of existing weakness shall be removed. The best, and, indeed, I venture to think the only, way of securing further strength to this Assembly is to add life Peers in large and considerable numbers
<col>460</col>
to the existing hereditary element. I put on one side the suggestion that county councils should be entitled to elect Peers to this House, for I think that if there is one matter on which people who have been engaged in connection with county councils on either side of politics throughout this country for the past twenty years have been more united than another, it is that politics ought not to enter into the qualifications of those who are elected to the county councils or into the business of the county councils. In the county council on which I have sat for years past the one point on which we have all been agreed is that whatever candidates come forward for the county council they shall bar politics, and I think that is the case with the majority of county councils throughout the country. As to elections <i>ad hoc</i> throughout the country for securing the election of Peers to be added to this House, I think it has been abundantly shown that there are too many elections taking place already, and that, to use a common expression, the country is rather fed up with elections. I dismiss altogether, therefore, in considering the best way of reforming your Lordships' House, any system of election by county councils or of election <i>ad hoc</i> of Lords of Parliament.<lb/>
The only remaining means, it appears to me, of giving additional strength to your Lordships' House is to allow a considerable number of life Peers to be added. The existing source of weakness in our House I think we are nearly all agreed consists in a number of Peers retaining their powers of legislation although they are unable or unwilling, except on very rare occasions, to come here and vote. Could there have been a more striking proof of that, if proof were needed, than yesterday, when only 187 Peers attended, or at all events took part in the Division? It was, I know, a Division on a minor issue, and a Division that may not have been expected by noble Lords who are present here to-day. But I am not sure that there are more than 187 Peers present in the House to-day. At all events, it was within the knowledge of every member of your Lordships' House, even those who inhabit the deepest and the darkest recesses of those backwoods which are supposed to be the places where so many noble Lords dwell, that Resolutions of the utmost importance were going to be brought up for consideration yesterday. Yet, as I say, only 187 Peers attended.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0256"/>
<col>461</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00951"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: Only 167.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00952"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: That strengthens my case. It appears that there were only 167, I thought the number was 187. I would not be so impertinent as to criticise the reasons why so few noble Lords were present, but I repeat that in the country it will be regarded as showing a considerable want of appreciation on the part of many noble Lords of their duties in this House when on so important an occasion only something between a quarter and a third of the members of the House attended. Excluding the noble Lords on the two Front Benches, I do not think there were more than a quarter of the members occupying hereditary seats in this House present yesterday. It may be&#x2014;I daresay it will be&#x2014;argued that when a general revision of the constitution of this House takes place, such a revision as will be implied by a Bill based on the Resolutions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, the constitution of the House of Commons should not be exempt from the general stocktaking, as it were, of the Constitution; and I am not at all sure that I for one do not think that a revision of the constitution of the House of Commons should proceed <i>pari passu</i> with the revision of the constitution of this House.<lb/>
We know, for the noble Earl the Leader of the House has told us, that unfortunately there is a state of war between the two Houses. The two Houses have come, into collision. The blame is put on the House of Lords. I will not venture to quote to your Lordships so old and trite a fable as that of the wolf accusing the lamb of muddying the waters when the lamb was drinking below where the wolf was drinking, but I think it is a parable that is rather applicable in regard to the accusations that have been hurled against us that we are alone responsible for the state of war and collision that has occurred between the two Houses. I should not dream of voting for the Resolution of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches if I thought that the continuity of the hereditary principle in this House was to be thereby abandoned; but I do not understand that the third Resolution which we are now discussing abandons that principle at all. As I understand, the rights of hereditary Peers in this House will probably be restricted by legislation based on these Resolutions to a representation among their own members&#x2014;that is to say, they will not all in future have the right of direct representation.<lb/>
<col>462</col>
On this side of the House we were certainly afforded a great treat yesterday when noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite twitted the noble Earl on the Cross Benches with the ambiguity of his Resolutions. The ambiguity of the noble Earl's Resolutions compared with the ambiguity of the Government's proposals&#x2014;I am not alluding to the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions but to the reforms that are some day to be proposed to us by His Majesty's Government&#x2014;is as light to darkness, and I am sure that many noble Lords on this side of the House when they heard noble Lords on the Front Government Bench twit the noble Earl on that subject thought of Satan reproving sin. I owe my seat in this House to the operation of the hereditary principle, and I am no opponent of the hereditary principle. And this I should like to say in favour of the preservation of the hereditary principle, restricted as the noble Earl on the Cross Benches proposes, as I understand, it should be restricted. I think I am justified in saying that nearly every noble Lord, either on these Benches or on the Benches opposite, who owes his seat to the operation of the hereditary principle has been brought up and trained to consider the exercise of that right, not as a personal privilege, but as a trust, in the same way as heirs to large landed estates in this country have been brought up and trained to consider that the possession of those estates, should they ever succeed to them, is to be regarded as a trust and not as a personal privilege; and I do not believe that the people of this country have considered, or consider now, that the way in which those estates have been administered or the way in which the hereditary votes have been exercised in this House has shown that the holders of those rights and those estates have exercised them in a manner unworthy of the way in which they have been trained and brought up to exercise them.<lb/>
But, my Lords, what is the existing state of things? The constitution of your Lordships' House is a structure of the thirteenth century, or at all events of a very early and remote period. Are we in the twentieth century&#x2014;I do not want to introduce politics into this question and therefore I will not say whether we are Liberals or whether we are Conservatives&#x2014;are we Peers of the United Kingdom to say that a structure that dates from the thirteenth century is incapable of improvement in the twentieth? I believe that it is foolish to say that such a
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0257"/>
<col>463</col>
structure, dating from such remote times, is incapable of improvement at the present time. I shall vote for the Resolution of the noble Earl because I believe that reforms based on that Resolution will be conservative reforms in the best sense of the word, and because I am willing and anxious to co-operate in remedying the defects and the failings of a very ancient structure, and to sweep away the cobwebs that have accumulated through all these centuries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00953"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech to which we have just listened is the strangest confession of faith on which to found a vote in favour of the Resolution I have ever heard. The noble Lord has given us a very favourable account of the mode in which the privileges of this House have been exercised and the spirit in which people have been educated in order to exercise them. The noble Lord has professed a belief in the hereditary principle and yet he concluded by saying that he was going to vote for a Resolution which, to my mind, condemns the hereditary system, though I am aware that it does not in actual words say so. I have asked more than once, when we have been discussing these questions, what is to be substituted for that which is, in itself, the most inoffensive, and, according to very high authorities, the most enduring system you could have. This is no new system. The Throne is hereditary, the succession to landed estates is hereditary, and in various forms and in various parts of the world that system is known and understood.<lb/>
I have said before, Is it not practical wisdom to know what is going to be substituted for it? No one has ever yet suggested what is to be done with what are called the undesirables. I do not believe in the existence of the undesirables in the sense in which, through the election, that word has been used. Bankrupts and lunatics form, apparently, the majority of this House according to statements made in various election speeches. That is a statement which, I suppose, the House will hardly acquiesce in, but allow me to say, as a matter of law, that bankrupts are excluded from this House. Over and over again I have heard in election speeches the loose general statements that are so easily made&#x2014;that they are all bankrupts and that there is also a certain number of lunatics in this House, but I pledge myself to the fact that bankrupts and lunatics are both of them incapable of exercising a vote in this House.
<col>464</col>
I am afraid you can never extinguish an absolute mis-statement once it has been allowed to run riot, as it has all through the election, but I desire to emphasise this, because it has been made use of very frequently in different parts of the country.<lb/>
Getting rid of that particular allegation, I want to know what is the meaning of the sort of phrases we hear. The truth is that in these times we live upon caricatures and slang phrases. What is the meaning of "Wild men?" Does it mean everybody who is not diligent in attendance, and that these persons ought to be excluded? I want to know, before we rashly, as I think, undertake this crusade against our own House, what is to be done, what is to be put in its place. I can well understand that we might arrange that, if a man did not attend for so many years or months, or what not, he should not be entitled to vote, though I doubt very much whether we would have any legal right to enforce that Resolution if we did. But, be that as it may, that is not what we are dealing with now.<lb/>
We are dealing with the reconstitution of this House and with the reconstitution of the country, for I presume it will be admitted that the House of Lords is an integral part of the Constitution&#x2014;indeed, one of the Resolutions which the noble Earl has moved affirms that very clearly. Then why is the House of Lords to be seized upon as that part of the Constitution which is to be amended, and, if amended, in what respect is it to be amended? There are too many people in it&#x2014;that is the only allegation I have heard agreed upon by those who are attacking it. Is not that true of the House of Commons? Does any one say that the present number in the House of Commons is not more than they can reasonably do business with? And if that is a reason for diminishing the numbers in this House, why is it not a reason for diminishing the numbers in the House of Commons? Has the noble Lord who spoke last ever even looked at the Division Lists of the House of Commons and observed how many of the large numbers in that House fail to take part in Divisions? I think that if the noble Lord did so he would find that the proportion who take part in Divisions in the House of Lords is not so very unreal in comparison with the other House of Parliament. But that is part of the attack on this House.<lb/>
I must appeal to the noble Earl who initiated the discussion as to whether his
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0258"/>
<col>465</col>
impression of the House of Lords and of the necessity for the revision of its constitution remains the same now as it was when he addressed his fellow-countrymen at Bradford on October 27, 1894. I am bound to say that that address was of a most bellicose character. The Ironsides were appealed to as parallels, and the noble Earl's statement then was that, in his view, it was the paramount duty of the Government to proceed to put down the House of Lords; and, although I quite admit that the noble Earl then said, as he said the other night, that he was not in favour of a Single Chamber, yet his denunciations of the House of Lords left very little to be desired by a person who wished to destroy it altogether, if his allegations against the House of Lords were true. All I can say upon that is that I had the pleasure of hearing the noble Earl the other night at the banquet to Mr. Harold Cox, and he then described what seemed to me a model Chamber. It was the only place in this country where free speech obtained and where unpalatable truths could be spoken, and the noble Earl went on to say it was a most remarkable state of things that that should be the only place where these attributes obtained. It is natural to inquire, if that is an accurate description of the House of Lords, what do you want to alter it for, what has it done wrong? This debate is not really concerned with the constitution and powers of the House. It is an electioneering debate. I suppose it is intended to get rid of something that has been said against the House of Lords. But, surely, no one who had really at heart the question of the constitution of the House would begin with preliminary Resolutions. If you want to amend the constitution of the House, or supply a new one, why fetter your hands by preliminary Resolutions? I confess I am in despair when I look around and see that unexplained phrases are put forward to take the place of deliberate and considered intentions. I do not say, and I have never said, that the House of Lords is not susceptible of improvement. It would be rash to say that of any human institution. But I ask again what has the House of Lords done that its present constitution should be altered. No doubt noble Lords on the Ministerial Bench would say it was because this House had upset the financial arrangements of the country. But if the Budget of last year had but followed the ordinary course of all Budgets there would have been no difficulty about passing it. Had not the authors of the Budget proclaimed that by it a new era
<col>466</col>
of legislation was being inaugurated? Can it be said then, that the Second Chamber is not entitled to consider whether the question of beginning a new era of legislation under the guise of the Budget should not, as a matter of prudence and equity, be submitted to the people?<lb/>
I also desire to ask&#x2014;How are you going to arrange the method by which the chosen hereditary Peers would take their seats in the House under the new arrangement? I have never been able to get any one to tell me that. Are you going to institute a system of entrance examination? In some of the United Stales of America no man is allowed to vote unless he can read and write, do the rule of three, and give a short account of the American Constitution. Are you going to adopt such a system? It is suggested that the Peers should elect representatives from among themselves, like the Scottish and Irish Peerages. But the Scottish and Irish systems were initiated at the unions of the Legislatures of these countries with the English Parliament, when it became necessary to limit by selection the number of Irish and Scottish Peers to sit in the United Parliaments. I therefore think that no analogy is afforded by the Scottish and Irish cases. The system of selection under the new arrangement should be made clear. Vague phrases about "improving" and "reforming" will not suffice. I submit that until we have a complete system before us we have no right to decide to take people's rights away. We have a House in which freedom of speech exists and the rights of property are respected, and it would be a serious experiment to destroy that House and then trust to being able to supply something better in its room.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00954"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL BATHURST</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to express the opinions of one who sits on the Back Benches of your Lordships' House. I fear that I must ask your indulgence because I have no way of wrapping up my words in pretty phrases, or putting my opinions diplomatically. I can only tell you the view of one who lives in the backwoods but who holds very strong opinions on this subject. I am afraid I must disagree with what many noble Lords have said during this debate. I cannot help thinking that when noble Lords express a desire for the reform of this House they feel very differently in their inmost hearts. It seemed to me when this debate started that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0259"/>
<col>467</col>
these proposals were the most far-reaching and the most revolutionary that had been put before the House for many a long day. There is evidently a certain feeling now among noble Lords that this is rather an academic debate&#x2014;that real business is not meant. I have heard that it is merely brought forward for some tactical reasons.<lb/>
What are the reasons for this great cry for the reform of the House of Lords? I cannot help thinking that it originated with the Socialists, who are strongly opposed to this House. Then the Irish joined in the cry. They have taken up the question of the Veto, for the reason that so long as the power of this House exists there is no possibility of Home Rule for Ireland. In this connection I should like to quote what was said only two nights ago by Mr. Redmond&#x2014;
<quote>"This question of the Veto is the supreme issue. For us it means Home Rule for Ireland. To it we are willing to subordinate everything, any number of Budgets, any conceivable issue that can be raised, and our interest is to see that the struggle for the settlement of the Veto question is conducted on lines of courage and determination."</quote>
Further on in his speech he offered terms for the settlement of the Budget. My Lords, it strikes me that had it not been for the action of the House of Lords in referring the Budget to the people, Ireland would have been suffering at the present time from those proposals which have been criticised so strongly.<lb/>
When the Irish also took up the cry of the Veto, the Radical Government saw at once their chance of making a political gain of this, and that is the way in which the matter has advanced and been put before the country. The Welsh also know that so long as the House of Lords exists they will never see the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales. Then when this great cry was started it occurred to politicians on this side of the House to start something as a counter-stroke to that policy, and at once everybody began to talk on this subject, and every paper began to write on the question of the reform of this House. The effect of advertising is well known. If a particular kind of soap or hair-dye is but advertised enough, the whole country will come to the conclusion that the particular soap or hair-dye is the very best. I contend that this cry for the reform of the House of Lords is only a well-advertised cry. Everybody has been reading or writing about it, and they believe now that it must be necessary. The result is the Resolutions which have been brought
<col>468</col>
before your Lordships' House by the noble Earl who sits on the Cross Benches.<lb/>
Is it a very sound position for us to take up to say that we do not in our heart of hearts believe that reform is necessary, but that because the Government have taken up the cry of the Veto, and because unscrupulous agitators have brought it forward, we think the best means of retaining our powers is to offer to reform ourselves on democratic lines? It seems to me my Lords,&#x2014;and this has been pointed out during the debate&#x2014;that if we reform ourselves on those lines this House will be much stronger than it is to-day. That is not what we want. I contend that this House suits the state of our politics better than any manufactured House possibly could. There is more elasticity in it, and in former days it has always passed those measures which the country really wanted. Moreover, even if we do manufacture a stronger House it will not satisfy anybody. There will still be that cry from the Irish, from the Radical Party, and from the Socialists. They will not be satisfied until they have brought in their Veto proposals, and until they have reformed the House on their own lines. My Lords, it will be a bad day when somebody else brings in reforms of this House instead of ourselves.<lb/>
My chief objection to the reform of this House is that it is tampering with the Constitution, and if we once admit that it is possible to tamper with our Constitution we do not know where it will stop. If we manufacture a strong House now it will be a precedent for others at some future date to reform it again, until our power and our prestige will have gone for ever. The greater number of the speeches which we have heard from noble Lords are to the effect that we must reform this House. I wish most strongly to protest against that. I believe also that this cry for reform comes from those members of the other House who are afraid that when they go back to their constituencies they will lose a certain number of votes, especially in the North of England and in Scotland. In Scotland they have this elective principle already. The Peers of Scotland are elected by their fellow Peers, and there is great dissatisfaction in Scotland from this elective principle. On no grounds whatever can I bring myself to vote for this Resolution.<lb/>
Before I sit down I would beg the House to consider the important changes which
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0260"/>
<col>469</col>
this Resolution may involve another day. I would ask those noble Lords who sit on the Back Benches&#x2014;descendants of noble Lords who have in former days occupied great positions in the State&#x2014;to reflect what they would say if their forefathers had lightly sold their birthright and disabled them from sitting and voting in the House to-day. I ask those noble Lords who sit on the Front Benches what will their children say of them if they lightly give away their inheritance? I would ask all noble Lords, before voting for this Resolution, to beware lest they take an action which may call upon them the bitter reproof of their descendants of the third and fourth generations for giving away so lightly that which their forefathers had so hardly won. I shall certainly vote against the Resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00955"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF GALLOWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although I am a pretty constant attendant in this House it is rarely that I address your Lordships, but I should like to do so on this occasion. The Resolution before us is, I fear, one of the most drastic ever submitted to this House, and if it is carried in its integrity most of us will probably turn round to the noble Earl on the Cross Benches and say, in the famous words of the Gladiator, <i>Ave, C&#x0153;sar, morituri te salutant</i>. Few of us will feel inclined to do this although we may admit that some reform of this House may be beneficial. We have heard that the size of the House is getting unwieldy, but the reason is very palpable. It is due to the leaders on both sides constantly adding to the number by introducing, with the consent of the Crown, many of those who have supported their political policy, and the present Government are the worst offenders in that respect, and consequently the Resolution of the noble Earl can have but a very transient effect in diminishing the numbers. I think, however, most of your Lordships will agree with the moderate proposals of the veteran Earl, Lord Wemyss, whose long experience in both Houses of Parliament is known to everybody. My Lords, the question of absentees may be dealt with when considering the reform of this House. There are those who will not, or cannot on account of ill-health or other causes, take part in the debates. I think this House would not be unreasonable in expecting that in a future Parliament those noble Lords should not occupy the position they do now.
<col>470</col>
Then, again, your Lordships may welcome the idea that the Leaders of both Parties should try to obtain from their Sovereign a promise as to future life Peerages as against hereditary ones&#x2014;that they may be more numerous. The reward given for political services is the cause of the enlargement of this House, but the revolutionary and unconstitutional character of recent legislation has had the effect of bringing the two sides of the House into such a position that on one side you will see perhaps 150 votes recorded, and on the other side only thirty. This Resolution, if carried, will, I think, be a recommendation to exclude certain members from this House, a proposal which I understand was made almost unanimously&#x2014;the only exception being the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury&#x2014;by the Select Committee. Several noble Lords objected to Lord Killanin's Amendment, that the Resolution should only be carried out in the case of future accessions to the Peerage, and indeed the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, advised him to withdraw it on the ground that, if it were passed, the action of your Lordships' House would be misunderstood in the country. Does it not occur to the members of the Select Committee that their own position is absolutely analogous? The Resolution would not affect them personally although they unanimously voted for it. They recommend your Lordships to declare that for the future an hereditary Peerage shall not necessarily carry a seat in this House as a Lord of Parliament, but they declare at the same time that it shall not affect their own personal position as such. I would point out to your Lordships the absurdity of such a recommendation. Possibly many of them would be elected if their fellow Peers thought it would be an advantage to the House to do so. Surely you must know many cases, however, within your own personal knowledge where, for political reasons, offices have been given to those who have been universally considered failures. Indeed, in many cases they have been raised to your Lordships' House or given high appointments under the Crown because they were failures. If you are going at all to abolish the hereditary principle it stands to reason that it should be done universally&#x2014;that is to say, everyone must be placed in the same position; you must do it without favour or affection, or you will be committing an act of gross injustice. Many of these exceptionally favoured
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0261"/>
<col>471</col>
individuals would never have had a chance of distinguishing themselves by holding office but for their original positions as eldest sons. Again, there are plenty of hereditary Peers who have not risen to high rank in the Services and yet have done good service to the State both in peace and war, as well as in their several districts where they are always recognised as men who have tried to do their duty to their King and country, and yet none of them have received the well-paid rewards for political Party services.<lb/>
The more you examine into the question the more I am sure you will see the un-wisdom of the action proposed. I will not detain the House longer, except to point out that your Lordships have been recognised throughout the country as a territorial influence, and this is one of the points which does not seem to have been very much borne in mind in the course of this debate. A man possessed of a large income in Funds or Stocks can any day leave the country and spend his money elsewhere, but a man who holds a large territorial position must stay here. The whole of his income comes from the land. He is obliged to do his duty by that land, and he does it. I am quite certain of this, that everybody will agree that the landlords of this country deserve well of their country. Go down to their districts and find out what is thought of them there. It is not there that the House of Lords is looked upon as an evil. It is in the great towns, where the people do not see them. All I can say is this, that the people wish noble Lords who have seats in this House to move amongst them and to be at the head of every movement, and I feel certain that a great many of those whose absence from this House we deplore are kept away by the duties which they carry out so faithfully in those parts of the country where they live.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00956"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CRANBROOK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not intend to take any part in this debate, but I cannot help thinking that even in passing this Resolution, which seems to be necessary in any reform, we seem to be putting the cart before the horse. It seems that we have been discussing the necessity of reform of this House without deciding beforehand the question upon which the necessary amount of reform will depend. It appears to me that the question of deciding in our own minds and in the minds of the country what is to be the ultimate machinery for settling differ-
<col>472</col>
ences between the two Houses of Parliament is an essential preliminary to any proper reform of this House. There have been published to-day the proposals of the Government for that purpose. I need hardly say, my Lords, that those are not proposals to which we should for one moment submit. They may be forced upon us hereafter, but they are not the kind of proposals which this House with any sense of dignity or of its responsibility to the country could accept. If we could abandon in this House the right of rejecting Bills of first importance, and if we could have the power of referring such Bills to the unbiassed judgment of the people of the country by way of referendum, I should think we might in that way provide a system under which the old Constitution of the country might go on for many a long year to come, and in that case the reform needed by this House would be very small. While I quite agree that we ought to diminish the numbers of this House, it is useless if the Government continue to reward their supporters and people whom they wish to get out of the House of Commons by giving them seats in this House. If we could get that diminution I think there would be a very hopeful outlook for the future. As far as I know, there are only two other systems which might be tried. You might, as has been suggested, diminish the numbers of this House so greatly that the two Houses might meet in one Chamber and vote upon a question. That is not an amendment of the Constitution to which I should be willing to submit, for I believe it would be practically putting an end to the powers of this House and merely making a fictitious arrangement intended to perpetuate the power of the House of Commons. You may, on the other hand&#x2014;and there is some little hope for that in the proposals of the Government&#x2014;reduce the length of Parliaments, and restrict the power of this House to reject Bills to one Parliament. You may in that way, I believe, make a compromise which might be satisfactory to the people and honourable to this House. I firmly believe, while I am going to support the noble Earl's Resolution because I think it is an essential preliminary to any reform, that it is foolish of us to proceed to any reform of this House until we have settled what is to be the mode of adjusting differences with the House of Commons after that reform has taken place.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-00957"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would ask leave to detain you for a few moments while I make one or two observations on the Resolution now before us. It appears to me, and I think I shall be echoing what is the feeling of every member of this House, that in considering the reform of your Lordships' House we should be very careful about adopting principles which are dangerous in themselves and incompatible with the whole history of the House in the past. I think, therefore, that any reform which is to strengthen your Lordships' House must be a reform which does not impair that sense of continuity which binds your Lordships' House of to-day to your Lordships' House of the past. It seems to me that a reform which enables the King to summon to the House of Lords for any Parliament such persons as he thinks likely to promote the welfare of the Empire would be quite in accordance with the original principles on which the House of Lords exists. It is true that a Writ of Summons to the House of Lords once granted has been held to be hereditary, but I imagine that that hereditary right is due to the feudal system rather than inherent in the original constitution of the House. It can hardly be denied that there are many persons outside your Lordships' House who for various reasons would be the kind of persons the King would have originally wished to summon to his Councils, and that there are members of your Lordships' House who perhaps not very perfectly fulfil the conditions which, would have originally led to their being summoned. There are two other matters which I think ought to be considered. Your Lordships' House represents the Lords spiritual and temporal, and I cannot think that any reform of this House which destroyed that character could possibly be a reform which did not destroy our continuity with the past. And I think also, to go back for one moment to the hereditary principle, that though the hereditary principle may not be, strictly speaking, as I think the noble Earl on the Cross Benches mentioned when he introduced the Resolution, an inherent part of the constitution of the House, it has been so long connected in popular estimation with the House of Lords that to sacrifice the hereditary principle or to destroy it would be a fatal mistake; and were it so destroyed nobody in the country would look upon this House as anything but a brand new body
<col>474</col>
created <i>ad hoc</i>, and not the old House of Lords.<lb/>
To apply these preliminary remarks to the present Resolution, it seems to me that your Lordships, by election amongst yourselves, could very well limit the number of hereditary Peers so as to make room for a greater number of life Peers summoned by the King, and that you could take effectual steps to exclude from this House Peers who, for whatever reason, ought not to have a vote. Your Lordships might also suggest the sort of persons who, as life Peers, would in your opinion add strength and weight to the councils of this House. These and such like things, if they are thought good, might be very well done in perfect harmony and consistency with the original character and constitution of this House. That would not, I think, in any sense be inconsistent. But&#x2014;and this is the point I wish earnestly to impress upon your Lordships&#x2014;if you gave assent to any principle of election from outside and endeavoured in that way to give this House a representative character, it appears to me it would be absolutely inconsistent with the existing constitution and the past history of this House. We are told that we ought to consider public opinion. Public opinion, however, is a shifting and changing thing, and I think we have first of all to consider whether public opinion is well-informed, and next whether in endeavouring to satisfy it we may not be endorsing principles which a little later will prove fatal to the maintenance of an Upper Chamber at all.<lb/>
In this connection&#x2014;and this is the last thing I have to say&#x2014;may I insist that there cannot be a greater mistake than to speak as though the House of Commons were alone representative. The House of Lords is also representative. It is co-ordinate with the House of Commons as a factor in the representation of the people, and as such it has its own distinctive and invaluable function&#x2014;the function of representing aspects of national life which are not represented, or are imperfectly represented, in the democratic House. Any attempt, then, to reform your Lordships' House ought to aim at enabling this House to discharge this function more perfectly, rather than to attempt to reform it upon a democratic basis, which can only make it either a formidable opponent of the House of Commons or a pale reflection of it. To adopt that principle is simply to play into the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0263"/>
<col>475</col>
hands of our opponents; and to accept principles which in the long run mean that you cannot be representative unless there is election from outside to put you in touch with public opinion, would deprive us of our power and would reduce this House to impotence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00958"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my rising has reference to the remark of the noble Lord who opened the debate this afternoon with regard to the poor attendance of Peers yesterday. I should like to say that when we left on Thursday in last week I fully understood that, very properly in my opinion, the consideration of this important Resolution would be postponed until after Easter, and that opinion, I believe, was held by a great many Peers in this House. Speaking for myself I went away to Scotland, and I quote myself as typical of a great number of Peers and of their actions. They have numerous duties to perform not only in this House but outside. Saturday I spent with the Yeomanry; on Monday I was engaged in county business; and these are duties which the Leader of the Opposition said accounted for the absence of a number of Peers from this House. We have numerous duties which call us away from Westminster. Not only on this but on every occasion Peers have their local duties to perform in various parts of the United Kingdom, and many of them are also engaged in military and naval services. Some have important posts abroad throughout the Empire; and I venture to say that any Peer who has had a seat in the House of Commons will frankly allow that in the matter of attendances the attendances in this House compare very favourably with those in the other House. On a big night in the House of Commons the House is crammed, but as soon as two or three important speakers have finished the attendance evaporates; and on the occasion of an important discussion on Indian matters or on the Estimates you will see the House with only a handful of members present. It is not fair that it should be bruited about that to consider this important topic yesterday there was not a proper attendance of Peers. I did not intend to make a speech on this occasion, but I am in hearty accord with what has just fallen from Lord Halifax. I think that we ought to proceed with great caution. I do not believe in surrendering a great principle. It seems to me the worst tactics in the world to give up a big position to the enemy and not think that he will not
<col>476</col>
afterwards also occupy the less important position. It is a matter of tactics. If the nation at large wishes to see elected members sitting alongside of us so as to bring us more in accord with popular feeling, it is for the nation itself to express that opinion. I hope that full support will be given on the lines laid before us by the noble Marquess the Leader of this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00959"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who took a somewhat active part in what was known as the "Peers' Campaign" prior to the General Election and met a good many audiences of various complexions I do not like to give an entirely silent vote on this important question. I merely wish to say that I cordially support the Resolutions which have been put forward by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. While it is perfectly evident that a great deal of the opposition and the supposed indignation against the House of Lords is manufactured for Party purposes&#x2014;deliberately manufactured by most unworthy and what I might call pestilential literature distributed in the great industrial districts where your Lordships are least known&#x2014;yet there is no doubt a feeling of what I may call restiveness amongst those who constitute the great body of moderate and reasonable opinion in the country, who think that a change in the constitution of your Lordships' House is desirable. There is no getting away from that fact. And there is a great deal of restiveness not only amongst moderate opinion, but amongst our own supporters in the country. I feel certain, if we were to adopt the line suggested by some of your Lordships who have opposed all reform whatever, that one of these days, and before very long, we should bitterly regret it. I am perfectly well aware of the fact that no sort of reform will satisfy those supporters of His Majesty's Government who are desirous of reducing the proceedings of this House to an absolute farce&#x2014;a farce such as is represented by the Government's Resolutions which have appeared in the Press to-day. I am also aware of the fact that nothing in the way of reform could satisfy that other body who wish to do away with anything in the shape of a House of Lords or a Second Chamber at all. But I do give my most cordial support to the Resolutions of the noble Earl because I believe they will have a very great effect upon that moderate and reasonable opinion of which there is such a very large force in the country, and which it is impossible for
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0264"/>
<col>477</col>
us to ignore. The exact methods of effecting reform can be considered afterwards. The noble and learned Earl below me (Lord Halsbury) laughs. I know he considers that the whole matter hangs upon the details. At the same time I think there is no getting away from the fact, as was stated so well by the noble Lord behind me a few minutes ago, that the Resolutions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches ought to be supported because they are an absolutely necessary preliminary to any reform which can be undertaken. Therefore I shall certainly support the Resolution, and I feel quite undeterred by the lurid prospect held out by the noble Lord behind me (Lord Bathurst) of our ghosts being cudgelled by an outraged posterity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00960"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as this appears to be a day for those who sit on the Back Benches, I ask the indulgence of the Committee while I make a few remarks on the question now before us. I want to repudiate, to start with, the suggestion that the action that the House of Lords is preparing to take at this moment is due to what is to happen, or to what has happened in recent times. We must remember that in the minds of a great many of your Lordships the necessity for a reform of the House of Lords has been ever present. It has been in the mind of the noble Earl who sits on the cross Benches since 1884, and I think it is quite evident that we are not acting as a result of pressure which has been brought at the moment, but because we are convinced that for the good of the country something must be done to strengthen the House of Lords. Undoubtedly the idea of reform has been hastened by what has taken place in more immediate times. The result of our action upon the Budget has turned the attention of people in the country to the position and to the authority of the House of Lords, and therefore the moment has come to see whether something cannot be done. What is really wanted, in my opinion, is to strengthen the authority of this House in the minds of the country. Therefore if it is a question of reform or no reform, I am an unhesitating supporter of the reform of the House of Lords, and for three reasons. First, because we want to strengthen the authority we possess for the action that we may take; secondly, because this Chamber is really becoming too unwieldy; and, thirdly, because we
<col>478</col>
must, if possible, try and eliminate the too strong partisan element that has accrued in this Chamber. To-day we have before the Committee the question whether we shall surrender privileges which we have hitherto enjoyed. If it is a necessary preliminary to reform I will unhesitatingly support the noble Earl when he goes into the Division Lobby; and if hereafter we have to think out a scheme&#x2014;the question is, I admit, bristling with difficulties&#x2014;I hope ample time will be taken, and that nothing will be done in too hurried a manner. I am quite certain that we must for the good of the country surrender privileges which we have hitherto enjoyed; and nothing appealed to me more than the words of the noble Earl when he asked noble Lords to consider the good of the nation and the necessity of doing something to strengthen this House. I am not going to discuss whether the elective principle is necessary, or how far it is to be adopted. I am satisfied that we must abandon the hereditary principle. I will also say this before I sit down, that if we are not to have the elective principle&#x2014;and I do not advocate it myself&#x2014;I am very much in sympathy with what fell from the noble Marquess in his eloquent speech, namely, the possibility of finding some way of getting rid of the partisan element by a system of nomination.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00961"><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like my noble friend below me I feel that, having taken part in the debates in this House for many years it is impossible in this, the most momentous debate that has ever taken place during that period, to remain altogether silent. I am going to vote for the Resolution of the noble Earl. I will confine my remarks to giving my reasons for so doing, and I will not discuss or estimate what is to follow. I confess that I shall give my vote for the Resolution only after much mental anxiety and even now with very great apprehension. But before doing so, I think one is justified in acknowledging one's regret at taking a step which is to deprive one of a privilege which one has enjoyed for very many years, and a responsibility which one has regarded as a great honour and a great duty. And not only is it depriving one's self of that privilege; it is depriving those with whom one is allied and those who will come after of that privilege, perhaps for ever.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0265"/>
<col>479</col>
The expression "vested interest" was used by a noble Lord last right. I do not think that is a very happy expression. A more correct and happier description of the duty of a Peer would be that he was obeying the commands of his Sovereign. I had the honour recently of standing at the Table when a new Peer was taking the oath, and I listened with close attention to the words used in the Patent of Nobility. The words were that that noble Lord was commanded by the Sovereign to attend here for the purposes of legislation. It is his duty; there is no question of a vested interest. There is the command of the Sovereign that he should attend here. Therefore what we are asked to give up by this Resolution is not only that which appertains to ourselves and to those who come after us, but we are actually asked to take away something which has been hitherto the privilege of the Sovereign. In such circumstances I submit one may approach a Resolution of this kind with the gravest hesitation. But I have made up my mind to vote for the Resolution for several reasons.<lb/>
In the first place, I feel that this House has grown numerically abnormally large. In the last one hundred years&#x2014;a short space in the history of your Lordships' House&#x2014;our numbers have nearly doubled. That, it seems to me, is too rapid an increase and has constituted a part of the present danger. If things were to go on as they are I do not know that that increase might not continue. Therefore I think the time has come when some effectual check is necessary upon an increase in the number of Peers. In the second place, I feel that I shall be echoing the feelings of the greater part of my neighbours. I do not profess to know the opinions of those outside my own immediate neighbourhood, but for thirty-eight years I hold that I have represented my neighbours in this House, not by election it is quite true. I know them intimately; they come to me on many matters, and I have always regarded it as a great honour to consider myself one of their members of Parliament, and I would relinquish that position with regret.<lb/>
As regards numbers, I feel most strongly, more strongly than anything else, that the abnormal majority on this side of the House is a great danger to the State. It was not ever thus. In earlier days,
<col>480</col>
as was pointed out by the noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, the numbers on each side were fairly equal. As he said, it was the policy pursued by Mr. Gladstone which gradually brought over members from the other side to this side, and that movement was increased with dangerous rapidity by the introduction of the Home Rule Bill. To rectify the inequality is, of course, the great difficulty, but it has to be done. The perplexity which marks the replies of every noble Lord whom I have questioned on the subject does not lead me to hope that anything practical can be done at very short notice, and I sincerely hope that a change will not be made at short notice. We have taken many centuries to build up the constitution of this House, and it is not to be expected that in one short session we are going to adapt to an old building of this kind something that will be both architecturally pleasing to the eye and at the same time useful for habitation within. For these three reasons, which seem to me very important reasons, I have made up my mind to vote for the noble Earl's third Resolution. At the same time I honestly confess I do so with considerable apprehension, and only because I feel that there is less danger in voting for this Resolution, which deprives us and those who come after us of certain privileges, than in leaving things as they are.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00962"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help thinking that there is a good deal of misunderstanding in the minds of those who are opposing this Resolution. In two or three of the speeches it has been described as the most drastic proposal that has ever been laid before this House, as a proposal revolutionary in character, and I think a noble Lord below me said that it amounted to a confession of our own un-worthiness; and then the noble Lord who has just spoken, although he is going to vote for the Resolution, tells us that he will do so with the greatest possible apprehension. I deny the accuracy of the descriptions which have been given of the nature of the Resolution, and I say most emphatically that it contains no condemnation of the hereditary principle, and that it is an absolutely necessary and indispensable preliminary to any change in the composition of this House. The noble and learned Earl on the Front Opposition Bench tells us that until a complete scheme of reform has been laid before this House it is unfair to ask your
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0266"/>
<col>481</col>
Lordships to pass such a Resolution. That attitude was like that of one who refused to go into Committee until he knew all the details which might be submitted to the Committee. Whether the scheme of reform hereafter to be proposed be good or bad, it surely is quite impossible to reduce the number of members or to prevent an undue increase in the future unless this House is prepared to consider some modification of the hereditary principle.<lb/>
I am no critic of the hereditary principle. I am prepared to defend the contention that it is much better to breed members for the Second Chamber titan to elect them by ballot; but your Lordships are not called upon to defend the hereditary principle at this moment because there is no condemnation of the hereditary principle in this Resolution. I doubt if the title by which noble Lords sit and vote in this House is sufficiently realised. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, has just reminded the House that that title is based on a Writ of Summons from the Crown. True the distinction of our ancestors and accident of birth render us eligible to receive that Writ of Summons, but the title by which we sit and vote in this House is the possession and receipt of that Writ of Summons. There is nothing inconsistent with that in the proposed Resolution. Even supposing that the Resolution is accepted by the House, and the spirit of it subsequently guides legislation, the accident of birth to which I have referred will still make noble Lords eligible to sit and vote in this House. The only modification of it, perhaps, would be that the selection from those persons so eligible would proceed according to certain accepted principles. Surely it cannot be denied that the hereditary principle will be strengthened and that the title of every Lord of Parliament will be increased if, in addition to his birth, which has rendered him eligible for membership, he also sits and votes either on account of his services to the State or because he has been selected by his Peers. That, surely, would be no condemnation or weakening of the hereditary principle. Later on we shall come to discuss the suggestions&#x2014;I have no doubt many will be made&#x2014;as to the principles which shall govern that selection; but at the present moment all that this House is asked to do is to pass a Resolution signifying its willingness to agree that the possession of an hereditary Peerage shall not of itself and unaccompanied by any other consideration give
<col>482</col>
the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords. My Lords, that is not a tremendous revolutionary proposal. It is an indispensable preliminary to any reform, and no one can vote against this Resolution unless he is prepared to say, not only that there shall be no reduction in the number of members of this House at present, but that at no future time should any check be placed upon its unlimited increase. I hope, therefore, that the Resolution will be passed by an overwhelming majority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00963"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not detain your Lordships very long, but I would like, as one of those who sit here as an elected Peer from Ireland, to say a few words. I shall support very cordially the Resolution of the noble Earl. I believe it is suggested that our number, which is now twenty-eight, should be reduced. I am quite prepared as one of the number of Irish Peers to retire into the backwoods with several of my noble friends and to take my chance, but I do hope we shall have in the future, as we have had in the past, a representation of Irish Peers in this House. Situated as we are in Ireland, we require support in this House. We look forward to coming here and getting assistance from our own side, and I should regret very much indeed if our numbers were cut down to any great extent. Personally, like many noble Lords who have spoken to-night, I am very much in favour, and always have been, of a reformed House. I feel that our numbers have grown too large, and that the only way for us to deal with this matter is by the Resolutions which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has put on the Paper. I do not think we are giving up anything, and if we are it is only fair and right that we should have the nation's interests at heart. Our object should be not to weaken this House but to strengthen it in every way we can, and to bring it, if possible, into closer touch with public opinion outside. I am not one of those who took any part during the late election on the hustings in my own country, although as it turns out the Budget proposals which your Lordships referred to the country are not very favourably entertained in Ireland. I daresay if one had gone out and spoken one would have received a very favourable reception at the hustings on those lines. I cannot help thinking that although the matter before the House is one of very great importance and one which appears to me to bristle with difficulties, a way will be found out of them
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0267"/>
<col>483</col>
if we approach the question with due caution and not stand too much at the present moment on detail. I do not share the apprehension expressed by Lord Harris. I feel confident that the action which your Lordships will take will strengthen and perpetuate and popularise this House which we all honour so much, and which has been for so many years a help and guide to the nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00964"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one or two noble Lords in addressing the Committee have referred to the way in which they are going to vote. I do not know whether the noble Earl on the Cross Benches intends to divide on the subject, but I sincerely hope that course may not commend itself to him, because I cannot but feel that if he does divide he will be giving a somewhat fictitious importance to the special work we are engaged upon to-night. We have before us a task which will eventually require an Act of Parliament, and when we come to framing the clauses of that Bill we shall have to be careful as to what exact limits we commit ourselves in any direction. I venture to suggest that that is not what we are doing now. At present we are merely preparing by a series of Resolutions a platform on which we are going to build, as we trust, a lasting edifice. These Resolutions are only preparatory to the work we have to do. To attach importance to them now as if they had the binding influence of an Act of Parliament would be altogether misleading and fettering ourselves in a way which is most undesirable. We have been reminded that in the Peerage of Scotland and Ireland this condition of affairs exists, and the noble and learned Earl told us that it was because a compact had to be entered into and conditions had to be drawn up. But he did not say that on account of the contract and conditions in connection with those Peerages, the hereditary principle had been renounced. The noble and learned Earl also told us that a bankrupt Peer was unable to sit in this House. Therefore the actual possession of a Peerage does not, even now, of itself entitle anyone who holds it to sit in this House. I cannot but think that we are giving a strained and somewhat dangerous interpretation to the Resolution now before us. It is almost universally admitted, keenly as we may regret it, that it will be practically impossible to carry out a reform of this House which will enable all those Peers who now have seats in it to remain and
<col>484</col>
vote. In order to bring about any change which would meet that unfortunate necessity, we should approach the matter from the spirit of the third Resolution. I think it is only fair and right that before this House is invited to go into the discussion on this great problem it should be made clear that the probable result will be that we shall have to come to some self-denying ordinance. How far the exact limits of that sacrifice must go, what exact limitations it will be desirable to impose, and what safeguards an Act of Parliament must have in it in order to prevent a misinterpretation of what we are doing, are points which I submit are premature at the present moment. We are now merely passing the Resolution for our own guidance and suggesting the direction in which our work must progress; and it would be unfortunate if we gave the country the impression that we regarded the matter in so serious a light that we thought it necessary to divide upon the proposition. I believe there are a great many who sympathise with those who look upon this matter with apprehension and it would be painful to go into the Lobby against them; but as one who cannot share their fears, believing them to be strained and unnecessary, I shall certainly support the Resolution moved by the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00965"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BOSTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust I may be pardoned for intruding in this debate for a few moments and thus breaking through the custom which obtains in this House that members who sit on the Back Benches should not on ordinary occasions unduly obtrude their opinions upon your Lordships. But as this is not an ordinary occasion, but one which specially affects the more humble members of this Assembly and upon which a free expression of opinion on their part seems desirable, I venture to ask your Lordships to bear with me for a few moments. A noble Lord who sits upon the opposite side of the House (Lord Willoughby de Broke) in the entertaining speech he made a few nights ago, stated that he addressed your Lordships as one of those members of this House now termed backwoodsmen. I do not think the noble Lord did himself justice in so labelling himself. But even it he can, by a stretch of the imagination, be described as dwelling in the outskirts of those sylvan shades, I can at any rate be said to hail from their innermost recesses, from a district the gloom and monotony of which is happily relieved by the existence in an extensive clearing of one of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0268"/>
<col>485</col>
the feudal residences of my noble friend the Minister for Agriculture. I sit here not by any merits of my own, but simply, as the phrase goes, as the son of my father. I am one of those hereditary Peers whose type is usually portrayed by our foremost political cartoonist as a decrepit and senile old gentleman seated with his feet in hot water or swathed in bandages and by his side a nauseous black draught labelled "Liberal Mixture," which a group of gentlemen is about to administer to him by force. This group usually consists of the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Home Secretary, but to these I think must now be added the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition and the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, who has taken so prominent a part in brewing the mixture which the hereditary Peers are now called upon to take. I have sat in this Assembly for something like thirty years, having become a member of it without a chance of seeking a seat elsewhere, and I have taken part, I think, in nearly all the Divisions on matters of moment which have engaged the attention of the House during that long period, and have brought to bear upon those measures such limited intelligence as a backwoodsman and a hereditary Peer can be supposed to possess. I have endeavoured to perform the same operation in the case of the Resolutions now before the House, and have arrived at the conclusion that as a complete reform and reconstitution of this House appears to be generally desired in order to bring it into closer harmony with modern conditions and with the new ideas of thought and action which are springing up among the people, we hereditary Peers who have no particular public services to place to our credit must not allow any selfish considerations to stand in the way, but must be content to surrender our right to sit and vote here. Upon the further questions which will arise as to the best methods of creating a Second Chamber acceptable to the nation, I express no opinion. Neither do I express any opinion upon the somewhat drastic proposals of His Majesty's Government, which we have seen in this morning's papers, for limiting the powers of this House. No proposals beyond those of the noble Earl are now before the House, and when any further proposals are submitted they will, no doubt, be adequately discussed and criticised. My Lords, I would only express the hope, if I may do so without presumption, that if this House is to be reconstituted, whether by one Party
<col>486</col>
or the other, it will be placed upon a basis which will render it more sympathetic to the legitimate aspirations of the people, less dominated by an element drawn exclusively from the ranks of the wealthy and leisured classes, and lastly, less under the control of one political Party in the State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00966"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My lords, I have already on one occasion at least made to the House my profession of faith with regard to this Resolution, and I have neither the right nor inclination to repeat that profession of faith this evening. But I want, if I may, before we go to a Division to say one word with regard to the scope of the Resolution itself. I agree with my noble friend Lord Lytton in thinking that there is a certain amount of misunderstanding with regard to the effect of the Resolution. We have already resolved that a strong and efficient Second Chamber can best be provided by the reform and reconstitution of the House of Lords, and we are now asked to go one step further and to say that it is a necessary preliminary to such a reform and reconstitution that the possession of a hereditary Peerage shall not of itself&#x2014;and I lay great stress on those words&#x2014;give a right to sit and vote in your Lordships' House. That Resolution has been represented as if it was equivalent to a repudiation of the hereditary principle. My Lords, I do not at all so read it. I will even go the length of saying that it would be possible for one of your Lordships to vote for this Resolution with the full intention of afterwards proposing that this House should consist entirely of hereditary Peers. All that we are really invited to do by this Resolution is to say that a hereditary Peerage by itself is not to give the title to sit and vote.<lb/>
I ask your Lordships whether that proposition does not lie at the very threshold of this question. Whatever reform of the House of Lords we may have in contemplation, no matter how moderate that reform may be, it seems to me that the acceptance of this Resolution is a preliminary condition without which we cannot hope to obtain the desired result. Take two or three of the suggestions we have been discussing. Some of your Lordships think that it would be desirable to relieve a certain number of members of this House who may be unable or unwilling or unqualified to take part in our business of their functions as Peers of Parliament. How can
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0269"/>
<col>487</col>
you do that unless by means of some such preliminary step as that which we are now asked to take? Take another kind of reform which, I think, received the general commendation of your Lordships. I mean the proposal that the numbers of this House should be reduced so as to render it less unwieldy in its dimensions than it is at present. How can you effect a change of that kind unless you harden your hearts at any rate to the extent of admitting that the possession of a hereditary Peerage shall not be sufficient to entitle the possessor to come down and take part in the work of this House? And the same, of course, is true when you come to other suggestions, such as those for taking steps to remove the regrettable disparity in numerical strength which now exists between the two political parties in this House. Therefore, my Lords, I for one regard this Resolution really as the gate, so to speak, through which we must pass before we can enter upon any of the roads along which we are asked to travel towards the goal of House of Lords reform. I must venture, therefore, to dissociate myself entirely from those who regard the Resolution as anything in the nature of a crusade against your Lordships' House. I think, on the contrary, it is the step most needful if we really intend to show by our action that we mean business, and that we are determined to deal seriously with the question of House of Lords' reform. For that reason, my Lords, I say again that I shall vote without a moment's hesitation with the noble Earl when the Resolution is put from the Chair.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00967"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise merely to say that we desire to offer no opposition to this Motion. The noble Marquess stated, and stated, I think, with perfect truth, that the carrying of some Motion of this kind is a necessary preliminary to any reform or alteration of the constitution of your Lordships' House. Although, as the House is aware, we propose to adopt a different course, and to deal, first, with the relations between the two Houses, yet we have never set aside the question of the reform of the constitution of this House. Indeed, as your Lordships are well aware, we definitely contemplate undertaking, if circumstances make that possible, a scheme for the reconstitution of this House, and as the wording of the third Resolution is such as
<col>488</col>
to enlist the sympathies of those who desire merely to make the faintest alteration in the present constitution of the House, and also is compatible with the views of those whom the noble Marquess described as crusaders against the House of Lords, we have certainly no desire to oppose this third Resolution of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00968"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to interpose for more than a moment in so extremely satisfactory a discussion as that to which we have listened. My noble friend opposite has just made the interesting announcement, of an academical character, that he and his colleagues do in time contemplate, have in definite contemplation&#x2014;I am not quite sure of the words&#x2014;the reform of this House. I think from what we have seen of the policy of the Government, as announced in this morning's papers, it will be wisdom on the part of this House to accept suggestions of reform rather from those who are friendly to it than from those who propose to proceed on the lines laid down in this morning's Press. My Lords, I was, I confess, a little depressed at one period of the discussion this evening, because it seemed to me to proceed very much in layers. There was no alternation of opinion, but a thick layer of opposition developed itself in successive speakers under the inspiration of the noble and learned Earl behind me, Lord Halsbury. I was gratified to find that that did not represent the overwhelming opinion, but that it was followed by an equally thick layer of Peers who were favourable to the proposition.<lb/>
The noble and learned Earl behind me made, as he always does, a very interesting, a very vigorous, and a very humorous speech. He did not indeed quote the circular which he has sent round to the more promising members of your Lordships' House, among whom, I am sorry to say, he did not reckon me, calling them with the voice of a trumpet to oppose this Resolution. But there was one remark he made which I do think deserves particular notice, because I think it more derogatory to the character of this House than anything which has been said by its greatest enemies. He said that this was a rare piece of electioneering. For my part, I beg emphatically to deny that statement. If there is one person in this House who ought to be considered
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0270"/>
<col>489</col>
innocent of any electioneering ambitions or devices it is the humble individual who now addresses you. But electioneering is a very wide phrase. I suppose that every measure that is introduced into either House of Parliament is, from some points of view, a measure of electioneering, because, I presume, no one wishes in this House, or in the other House either, to do that which is repugnant to the great mass of his fellow-countrymen. As I think Lord Denbigh said, many Peers going in and about the country during the recent crisis, having discovered that the process of reform undertaken by your Lordships yourselves as against the process of reform suggested from outside would be gratefully received by the country at large, have been stimulated to come and vote in this House for these three preliminary Resolutions.<lb/>
There was another expression in the noble and learned Earl's speech which I thought also a little derogatory to the character of this House. He quoted me as saying that it was the one place in Great Britain where unpalatable truths might be uttered without interruption. I entirely maintain that statement, and, as the noble Marquess behind me, Lord Salisbury, said in his speech the other night, no one has tested that amiability and courtesy of your Lordships more than I have myself. But I would remind the noble and learned Earl that a legislative Chamber does not exist entirely for the utterance and acceptance of unpalatable truths. It has functions very considerably above and beyond those, and it is to the strengthening of the authority of the House of Lords in the exercise of those functions that I frankly and freely admit these Resolutions are aimed.<lb/>
After this third Resolution is passed, as I sincerely hope it will be, if a Division is thought necessary, by an overwhelming majority, we have to look a little into the future. The noble and learned Earl asked more than once what was the plan that was to follow these Resolutions. I think that indicates a certain misapprehension of the proceedings to which I have pledged myself. Those who desire the reform of the House of Lords have distinctly avoided framing a definite Bill or a definite plan because that is not our purpose in the proceedings to which we are accessory. Our idea, at least if I interpret the mind of my friends
<col>490</col>
rightly, is this, that the House of Lords should, with great deliberation, I admit, but with deliberation, adopt and lay down certain broad principles on which this reform might well proceed. Beyond that, I have no idea whatever of inviting the support or the consent of your Lordships to any plan or scheme whatever. I think that to do that would be to go beyond the functions of an Opposition, much more beyond the functions of a Cross Bench, and that any definite and detailed scheme must come from a Government in power and not from any private member or even any leading Opposition member of this House. Therefore, what I should propose to your Lordships is that, after the Easter recess, we should take one or two or three or more Resolutions gradually and deliberately, that those should not indicate an exact framework for a new Second Chamber, a task from which I should recoil, but should simply lay down broad and general principles on which we think as a House of Lords that reform should proceed. I venture to express my firm belief that, if those principles, or anything like them, represent the general tendency of your Lordships' mind, they will act as a very agreeable and acceptable alternative in the minds of the great mass of the nation as compared with those that are produced in the newspapers this morning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00969"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps your Lordships will suffer me to say a very few words in regard to the statement, which is, I think, completely new, although I do not say it is inconsistent with his former declarations, that has fallen from the noble Earl. As regards what we have done, we have affirmed three propositions. I hope I shall not incur the displeasure of the noble Earl by saying that no one is committed to anything by any one of those propositions. There are three methods by which you can compose a Second Chamber&#x2014;the hereditary, the nominative, and the elective. It is compatible with those three Resolutions that this Chamber should consist of all hereditary Peers, of all nominated Peers, or of all elected Peers, or in any of the numerous possible combinations between those three. There is no numerical parity, or disparity or proportion which is also not completely reconcilable with every one of those three propositions. Under these circumstances,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0271"/>
<col>491</col>
my Lords, I did venture to suggest at an earlier stage of the debate that it might be desirable to know a little more. I do not presume to pry into the secret wishes of the noble Earl, into, perhaps, his undeveloped and immature views of some of the details, but that we should know what on earth it is he really wants at the end of it all. I am glad to learn from the noble Earl that he proposes after Easter to bring forward Resolutions, and if we shall be able to know who will sit, or what class of persons will sit in the House under any scheme proceeding from those Resolutions, then I quite apprehend that we shall come to some effectual business conclusions. But at present, with all respect to the noble Earl, I really do think that what the noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, said is perfectly true, that we ought not to attach a fictitious importance to the Resolutions we are asked to accept.</membercontribution></p>

For some time past I, with the assistance of some eminent coadjutors, have been busy taking steps towards doing what ought long ago to have been done, namely, the codification of the Criminal Law of this country. The consolidation as well as the codification of the Criminal Law of this country has been repeatedly desired, and various Dependencies of the Crown have wished to have a complete codification of the English Criminal Law as a model which they could adapt to their own requirements. In some cases it has been found necessary to use the Indian Code, and to apply that, because we in this country have nothing of the kind. I am now taking steps towards codification. The first step contained in the Bill I am presenting to the House will deal with the law relating to perjury, which is the most difficult of all, involving some hundred Acts of Parliament, all of which have to be re-adapted and put in their right order. After the Second Beading of the Bill I will ask this House to invite the other House to concur in setting up a Joint Committee in order to examine the Bill and make sure it contains nothing except what is the law at the present time. If that work is successfully carried through I have other stages in view, and I hope in course of time I, or my successor with my hearty assistance, will be able to accomplish the codification of the Criminal Law, which has been so long desired.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LAND PURCHASE IN IRELAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00997"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> had given notice of his intention "to call attention to the Regulations made by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on February 15, 1910, as to priorities of sales, and especially to the urgent necessity for an extension of the time during which applications can be made under them, and to ask&#x2014;(1) what total sum of money will be available in cash for all advances in 1910&#x2013;1911; and (2) the amount of cash that is expected to be available for distribution to vendors who are willing to take half of their purchase money in stock."</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00998">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the Notice which stands in my name was placed on the Paper last week at a time when noble Lords from Ireland and our friends who usually work with us in Ireland were rather discontented, more especially because we felt that we were being kept in ignorance. But since then the Chief Secretary has written a very full letter to my friend Mr. Willis, the Secretary of the Irish Land-
<col>498</col>
owners' Convention, in which he deals very fully with a number of points which I should have been glad to raise otherwise this afternoon. That letter was written on Monday, and I understand it was published in Ireland yesterday. I am sure we are all grateful to the Chief Secretary for the length at which he has answered the Minute that was sent to him a fortnight ago by the Irish Landowners' Convention, and I desire more especially to express my thanks to the noble Lord opposite (Lord Denman) for letting me have a copy of Mr. Birrell's letter within almost half an hour of the time that it was posted to Mr. Willis. I feel indebted to the noble Lord for his courtesy in the matter, and the fact that the letter has been published makes it unnecessary for me to go into this subject at any length this afternoon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-00999">I do not wish to say that the letter has absolutely satisfied us as regards everything in the Regulations, but it is quite obvious that it would be no use my raising the subject any fuller because I am sure the noble Lord could not give us any different answer to-day from that which he would have given last Monday. As to the provision of cash, I have no hesitation in saying that we are very grateful for the efforts the Government have made and are going to make for securing satisfactory progress during the forthcoming twelve months. Therefore all I wish to call attention to this afternoon is the question of the extension of time referred to in my Notice. The position is this. The Regulations were issued in the middle of last month, and applications under them must be made before April 1&#x2014;that is, six weeks were given in which applications were to be made. I was over in Ireland for about ten days a fortnight ago, and since then I have had a number of communications from Ireland. Everybody from whom I have heard urges with the utmost insistence that it is absolutely necessary that an extension of time should be granted up to which applications are to be made under these Regulations, and for this reason. It is not that the landowners in Ireland have had six weeks in which to make up their minds. They have had nothing of the kind, because it was impossible for anyone to consider the question until he knew how much money was to be applied during the next twelve months for the purposes of the Land Purchase Acts, and that information, as I have said,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0275"/>
<col>499</col>
only reached the public yesterday. The period between yesterday and April 1, your Lordships will see, is merely ten days, and of those ten days four days do not count at all for the purposes of business. Everyone concerned is urging that an extension of time should be given.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01000">I do not think I can prove the matter more shortly than by reading to your Lordships three resolutions which really cover the whole ground. The first is a resolution passed by the Executive Committee of the Irish Landowners' Convention on March 10. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Executive Committee of the Irish Landowners' Convention desire to represent to His Majesty's Government that it is a most urgent matter that the time for making applications under the Regulations of February 15, 1910, should be extended from April 1 to May 1 or June 1. Owing to the complicated position in many cases and to the fact that many vendors are abroad, the Committee are aware that in numerous cases decisions cannot be arrived at before April 1."</quote>
The second resolution concerns the land agents, and it is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The Executive Committee of the Land Agents Committee of the Surveyors Institution, Irish Branch, desire to endorse the resolution adopted by the Executive Committee of the Irish Landowners' Convention, urging on the Government the necessity of extending the time for making applications under the Regulations of February 15 last. In addition to the two grounds mentioned in that Resolution, this Committee wish to point out that no vendors were in a position to even consider this question until the publication of the Lord Lieutenant's Regulations of February 15, and even now the difficulty of arriving at any decision is very great owing to the refusal of the Government to give any information as to the amount of money which will be made available for advances in the next twelve months."</quote>
That last paragraph now goes, because we have information as to the amount of money we may hope for. But, as I have pointed out, there are only six working days available for consideration with that knowledge in our hands. The third resolution is from the President of the Incorporated Law Society. It runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The Council of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland are of opinion that the date fixed &#x2026; should be extended from April 1 to June 1, so as to afford to those vendors who are abroad an opportunity of being communicated with so as to be able to instruct their solicitors as to their wishes in the matter."</quote>
Therefore, this is the position. The landowners' organisation, the land agents' organisation, and the solicitors' organisation all urge that the Government should give an extension of time for the reasons they set forth in these resolutions. I
<col>500</col>
sincerely hope that the noble Lord who represents the Irish Office will be able to tell us that His Majesty's Government, after further consideration, have been able to accede to this request. In making this request the last thing we desire to do is in any way to impede or delay the working of the Land Act. If this extension of time was given, it would by no means cause a holiday or a waste of time in the office of the Estates Commission, who have plenty of work to do in clearing off the &#x00A3;50,000,000 worth of property which remains to be dealt with as the result of originating applications.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01001"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to support as strongly as I can what has been said by my noble friend as to the great difficulty in which many vendors find themselves from the very short time at present allowed in which to make these applications. At a meeting of the committee of the Landowners' Convention at which I was present about a fortnight ago it was mentioned that many vendors were abroad and therefore could not be consulted by their solicitors and men of business. I wrote some days ago to my friend Mr. Willis, our secretary, asking if he could give any particular cases. He replied that he had not had time to make inquiries generally among land agents and solicitors, but that he had heard of two vendors who are in South America, one in Australia, one in Abyssinia, one in Pretoria, several in India, and one who is somewhere in the Sahara Desert. That is, of course, anything but an exhaustive list. Mr. Willis had only happened to hear of these cases, and there are probably a good many more of the same kind. There is another difficulty in the case of co-owners of property. It must take them some time, considering their respective interest, to agree upon any course. I therefore earnestly hope that His Majesty's Government will consent to an extension of the time allowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01002"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord replies I should like to say one word on this subject. I have had several letters myself concerning it from friends of mine, telling me the problem that was set to them, and pointing out that though they had very able solicitors and agents they could get no direct advice on the subject because the problem was so uncertain in the absence of full information as to the money that would be available
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0276"/>
<col>501</col>
and other matters. In one or two of these cases I read the papers myself in order to see exactly the position, and although the solicitors were to my knowledge as able as any that could be found in Ireland, and although I knew the land agents who were acting in those cases were as experienced as any to be found in the country, they were quite right in saying that they were then unable to advise, and I myself would not take the responsibility of giving any advice whatever in the matter. Practically the question has only arrived at a position when any real advice could be given since the last letter of the Chief Secretary. I agree with what my noble friend has said in acknowledgment of the way the Chief Secretary has met the situation. He has given all the information he could reasonably present, and I have no doubt that when it is considered it will largely assist people to arrive at a sound judgment. But that letter was only written a few days ago, and I saw it for the first time this morning. It is obvious that no one who had not read that letter could give any advice on the subject.<lb/>
There can be no suggestion that there is any desire to delay matters. On the contrary, there is every wish to hurry the matter on, for every day's delay is inconvenient to both tenants and owners and is also inconvenient to encumbrancers. If the present day stands and a decision has to be arrived at before the 1st of next month, it is obvious that a decision cannot be given in an enormous number of cases. That is so even where the people concerned are in Ireland, and in the case of those who are out of Ireland it will be simply impossible for them to have the materials to guide them to a decision. Everyone recognises that the matter is not easy for the Government any more than it is for the parties concerned, and no one has a right to ask for an extravagant extension of time. I think my noble friend mentioned the period of a month as the suggested extension. I think the solicitors' organisation&#x2014;and they are entitled to speak on this question with authority&#x2014;named a month later still. Personally I do not make any suggestion at all as to the date. All I say is this, that it will be quite impossible to expect those who are most concerned to arrive at a decision within the next week, and that it is absolutely necessary to give some extension. I need hardly say that I leave it where
<col>502</col>
it must rest, namely, with His Majesty's Government, but I would suggest that an extension of a further two or three weeks at all events should be allowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01003"><member>LORD BARRYMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the letter of the Chief Secretary gives a great deal of valuable information, but there is no mention whatever in Mr. Birrell's letter of the class who might possibly elect to take Stock entirely. The presumption would be that the offer of Stock is one which should be held out as an inducement to vendors, so that they may be paid more quickly probably than the other classes. I do not know whether the noble Lord can give us any information as to whether the cases of those who elect to take Stock only will be considered <i>pari passu</i> with the other two cases&#x2014;those who take cash and those who take half cash and half Stock</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01004"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was glad to be able to impart to the noble Earl and his colleagues from Ireland some information which they regard, I gather, as not wholly unsatisfactory&#x2014;at any rate not of such an unsatisfactory character as I am afraid they consider some of the statements which I have had to make in this House. As the noble Earl has left the Question on the Paper, although it has been answered in the Chief Secretary's letter, with regard to the amount of cash that the Treasury intend to provide during the forthcoming year, perhaps I may be allowed to state what the figures are. The total amount of cash to be advanced for this purpose for the forthcoming year is &#x00A3;5,000,000. Of this &#x00A3;2,000,000 will go to vendors who receive payment wholly in cash, &#x00A3;2,000,000 to those who take half in Stock and half in cash, &#x00A3;500,000 for sales to the Estates Commissioners, and &#x00A3;500,000 to the Congested Districts Board. I believe that that allocation is not regarded as unsatisfactory by noble Lords opposite. The point at issue between us is the date up to which landowners may schedule their agreements with the Estates Commissioners. We have fixed the date of April 1, and we hold that it is in the interests of all parties concerned that that date should be retained. We consider that we have given due and ample notice in this matter. The Regulations were published six weeks ago, four months have elapsed since the Act came into operation, and there was an identical section in the Bill of 1908 to that which is in the Act of 1909 which outlined pretty clearly what the conditions would be; and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0277"/>
<col>503</col>
I think anybody who read the clause in that Bill and followed the subsequent debates in Parliament, as I have no doubt landlords who contemplate selling under the Land Purchase Act have done, might have been in a position to make up his mind as to what would be the most advantageous course for him to pursue.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Donoughmore, says that the amount of cash available makes a great difference. I think it must have been known at all events approximately, what the amount of cash was likely to be, and I cannot see that the knowledge of the actual amount of cash should make a difference to those landlords who did not know under which register it would be most advantageous to them to have their estates scheduled. Lord Clonbrock spoke of the hardship of certain gentlemen who are abroad. He referred to one gentleman who he said is in the Sahara Desert. Well, I am not quite sure that it is possible for him to get home by June 1, or that he would be in any better position if the time was extended to June 1 as suggested by the noble Earl. Therefore I am afraid we are obliged to adhere to the date which we have laid down. There are bound always to be cases of hardship of this kind occurring in connection with any specific date, but I do not think the cases of hardship will be many, and they will certainly not be so numerous as if we allowed the date to be altered and compelled persons who thought that they might lodge their agreements at once to wait another two months. That would certainly be a hardship to them. As it is, if anybody is uncertain how the operation of the Act will work he has only to wait one year&#x2014;namely, till April 1, 1911; therefore these people will only lose one year at the outside. I am afraid we cannot accede to the request made by Lord Donoughmore that the date should be altered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01005"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord told us that he was happy to be a harbinger of good tidings at any rate on one occasion, and I wish he had been able to carry that out to the full by making the concession for which my noble friends have asked. I am afraid that the Government have hardly appreciated how much they will defeat their own aims by the arrangement which they have made. I do not wish to be in the least unreasonable.
<col>504</col>
We all know what the difficulties are at this moment of providing a sufficiency of cash, and it is quite obvious that the desire of the Executive must be to induce as many owners as possible to accept a portion in Stock in order that the cash which it is so difficult to find may be made to go as far as possible. How can that be in the circumstances under which these landlords are asked to make their selection? The noble Lord said he did not see what the amount of cash available would have to do with it; but, my Lords, it is of the essence of the whole matter. Take a man who sold his estate four or five years ago and is still waiting. His tenants all the time have been paying three and a-half per cent. when they expected to be almost at once admitted to the halcyon position of paying three and a-quarter per cent and also paying off the purchase money. He now sees only &#x00A3;2,000,000 of cash assigned to vendors in his position who had been expecting cash, while he sees that &#x00A3;4,000,000&#x2014;&#x00A3;2,000,000 in cash and &#x00A3;2,000,000 in Stock&#x2014;will be assigned <i>pari passu</i> to those who come forward and say that, owing to the state of their estates and the absence of mortgages or for other reasons, they can afford what is really the serious loss as between the three and a-half per cent now received and the three per cent. which those who have settled estates will receive if they elect to take Stock instead of cash. There are 5,330 persons on the register at this moment, and according to that priority it is by no means impossible that in the first year those vendors who are as low down as, say, number 1,000 will find themselves placed and their estates taken in priority to those who are as high on the list as number 100. That is really a serious position of things.<lb/>
I fear that the Government have dealt somewhat hardly with those who can only afford to take cash in assigning an equal amount to those who can afford to take Stock. I think myself that if a larger proportion had been assigned, say &#x00A3;3,000,000 to the one and &#x00A3;1,000,000 to the other&#x2014;which would mean that &#x00A3;3,000,000 would be given directly and &#x00A3;2,000,000 would be taken by those who can take half Stock and half cash&#x2014;a better result would have been attained. But the Government, by pressing for the answer by April 1, will almost inevitably drive a large number of people to elect for cash who would otherwise elect for Stock; and if the vendor
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0278"/>
<col>505</col>
wished to change afterwards, though by the Regulations it is quite true that an applicant may transfer from one register to another, in that case he would take priority on the register to which he is transferred as from the date of transfer. He therefore would go right down to the bottom of the list of those who happened to have elected for Stock. I think that, in their own interests, the Government ought to allow a longer period in order to enable those who at this moment will certainly elect for cash&#x2014;and they will include the whole of the persons mentioned by Lord Clonbrock and all others who are at this moment out of the country, for no one acting for them could possibly consent to take Stock at a discount without their consent&#x2014;to fully consider the situation and not be forced into the cash register from which the Government desire to remove as many vendors as possible. I would urge the Government even now to reconsider the matter and see whether another month could not be allowed in which to enable these men to make their selection. Obviously whatever plan is now adopted is likely to be made a precedent for the future. I hope that as a result of this conversation it will be possible for the Chief Secretary to reconsider this most important point, and by extending the time give what would certainly be satisfaction to large classes connected with the sale of land in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01006"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount, like the other noble Lords who have taken part in this discussion, stated his case with great moderation. Of course, the whole question is really that of the greatest public convenience, which it naturally would be the desire of the Irish Government to meet. But I cannot help thinking that some noble Lords have rather overstated their case in implying that it was not until the letter of the Chief Secretary was published that it was possible for anybody to make up his mind what course he would take. We indicated very fully, in the course of the debates, what would be the probable allocation, and that allocation&#x2014;I am speaking from memory, but I think I am correct&#x2014;has been practically adhered to; and I certainly should have thought that it would have been open to any man who was contemplating an application to take it as probable that the allocation which we
<col>506</col>
foretold would be the actual allocation and to lay his plans accordingly. Of course, if there had been some extraordinary disturbance in the money market, some great national crisis which had prevented the issue of the &#x00A3;2,000,000 cash and the &#x00A3;2,000,000 to be combined with the &#x00A3;2,000,000 of Stock, and also the further sum provided for what have been called the subsidiary transactions&#x2014;of course, if that had happened their expectations might conceivably have been upset. But I confess it is not clear to me why any landlord who contemplated a sale should not have been able with his legal advisers to come to a definite conclusion as to which class he would go into according to the circumstances of his estate&#x2014;which, of course, have not altered since then&#x2014;assuming that the &#x00A3;5,000,000 of which we spoke were available. Therefore I confess that the plea for delay does not seem to me as strong as noble Lords have endeavoured to make it.<lb/>
As regards the question raised by Lord Barrymore, the point had not been brought before me, but I think he may take it as quite certain that no man will be damnified as regards priorities by his taking the course which is, of course, the most agreeable of any to the Irish Government&#x2014;that of offering to take all his payment in Stock; and I think it may fairly be assumed that he and his class will have as fair a chance as others and come in relative order with those who apply in other ways. Of course, we shall be happy to convey to my right hon. friend the Chief Secretary the strong expression of opinion of noble Lords opposite; but in view of the fact that it is, I believe, the deliberate opinion of the Irish Government that more people would suffer by postponement than would gain, I am afraid I cannot hold out very much hope that my right hon. friend will be able to reconsider his decision on the subject. One is very sorry for gentlemen who find themselves in remote parts of the world, but it seems to me that a man who goes off into distant parts of the Empire or outside the Empire when a transaction of this kind is immediately pending has really only himself to thank if he is not on the spot to make up his mind at the moment when he is asked to do so. But, as I say, I will inform my right hon. friend of the strong expression of opinion given in your Lordships' House to-day, though I am not sanguine that he will be able to change his mind.</membercontribution></p>

But I take note of the fact that the noble Earl said it was the desire of the Irish Government to meet the public convenience in regard to this matter. Now my noble friend Lord Donoughmore brought forward the testimony of bodies which surely ought to be able to speak with an immense weight of authority as to the matter of public convenience. My noble friend cited not only the resolution of the Irish Landowners' Convention, but the resolutions of the Executive Committee of the Land Agents Branch of the Surveyors Institution and of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland. I confess that if, in estimating public convenience, you are to weigh the unanimous opinion of these bodies on the one hand against the opinion of the officials of the Irish Office on the other, I should be very much inclined to attach more weight to the outside and independent testimony of these bodies, composed as they are of thoroughly competent men, than I should attach to merely official opinion. The fact remains that the parties interested in these large and important transactions are really only given a few days in which to make up their minds. I was glad that the noble Earl did not entirely close the door, and I trust that he will inform his colleague of the strong feeling on the subject entertained in Ireland. But I rose mainly with the object of calling attention to the fact that to the best of my belief a question put by my noble friend Lord Barrymore has not been answered. Lord Barrymore asked for information as to the position of those vendors who elect to be paid entirely in Stock. We understand from the Chief Secretary's letter that &#x00A3;5,000,000 altogether are to be devoted to these purposes. Of those &#x00A3;5,000,000, &#x00A3;2,000,000 go to transactions entirely in cash, &#x00A3;2,000,000 to transactions half in cash and half in Stock, and the remaining &#x00A3;1,000,000 half to the Estates Commissioners and half to the Congested Districts Board. My noble friend wanted to know what would be the position of the vendor who elected to take Stock and Stock alone. Is there any limit to the amount of transactions in Stock as there is a limit to the amount of transactions half in Stock and
<col>508</col>
half in cash or entirely in cash, or may we understand that the amount of transactions in Stock alone is to be limited only by the pace at which, with due official convenience, the Stock can be issued and the different estates upon the all-Stock register dealt with by the responsible officials.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE HOUSING<lb/> ACTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01010"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> rose "to call attention to the difficulties in the administration of the law under the various Housing Acts, and to ask His Majesty's Government whether, in their opinion, the present is not an opportune session in which to introduce the promised measure of consolidation."</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01011">The noble Earl said: My Lords, my reason for putting this Notice on the Paper is twofold. The President of the Local Government Board last session, in the course of the proceedings on the Housing and Town Planning Bill, stated that as soon as the Bill was through the Government intended to introduce a measure for the consolidation of all the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and he said that he hoped to be able to do it in that session&#x2014;namely, last session. This session, as far as we gathered from the gracious Speech from the Throne, is one in which there is not going to be a large number of measures introduced by His Majesty's Government, and although I believe I am correct in saying that those eminent public servants, the Government draftsmen, have in the last few sessions during which His Majesty's Government have been in power had as much work to do as, and perhaps rather more than, human nature could well be expected to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0280"/>
<col>509</col>
undertake, in this session their labours are exceptionally light. It occurred to me, therefore, that as the President of the Local Government Board was last session ready to proceed at once with a consolidation measure, which is very badly needed, His Majesty's Government might devote this session to producing a Bill, which, after all, would be entirely non-controversial, and would he of great assistance to those who have to administer the Housing Acts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01012"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Allendale, who is unable to be present, I rise to answer the noble Earl's Question. This matter has not been lost sight of by the Local Government Board. In fact, the President is very fully alive to the desirability of the consolidation of the Housing Acts, and such consolidation must inevitably be made. At the same time the President is of opinion that it probably would be as well to allow a little time to elapse before introducing such a Bill in order that it may be seen how the Act of last year works, and in order that when the Consolidation Bill is brought in any small necessary changes, which will almost inevitably be wanted, may be introduced at the same time. Your Lordships are aware that it has been the practice in the past that these Consolidation Bills should run concurrently with the necessary small amendments which time shows to be necessary in the case of new legislation. I hope the noble Earl will understand that the matter has not been lost sight of, but that any delay which has occurred is due to that reason.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01015"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first part of the Question is that the effect of Article 3 of the Brussels Convention has been correctly stated by the noble Earl. I understand there is no obligation under the Convention to impose an Excise duty on home-grown sugar in the United Kingdom so long as the Customs duty remains at its present figure; but recently my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in the House of Commons that it is held, although the question has not yet been settled, that the terms of the Sugar Convention Act of 1903 are such as to necessitate an Excise duty on sugar manufactured from home-grown beet in the United Kingdom. He is advised, however, that the actual charge of duty would have to be the subject of special legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01016"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: It is only an enabling clause. There is no obligation whatever in the Sugar Convention Act, and I cannot understand how anybody reading that Act can say that there is any obligation whatever under the Act to impose that duty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01017"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: It is a technical matter, but if I refer to the Act I think I may be able to point out to the noble Earl the point at issue. Section 2 of the Act runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The duties payable under the Finance Act, 1901, or any Act amending that Act, shall be taken on the delivery of any article from the factory or refinery and shall be the same as those payable on the like articles on importation."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01018"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: What Act is the noble Lord quoting from? I have in my hand the Sugar Convention Act of 1903.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01021"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl will refer to the end of Section 2 he will see the words that I have quoted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01022"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: I am not in any way convinced that the clause which the noble Lord has quoted is not simply dependable on the enabling clause. It is all dependent on what His Majesty may do by Order in Council. But I will put another Question on the subject later on.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE DOMINIONS AND THE NAVY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01056"><member>LORD BRASSEY</member> rose "to call attention to the disposal of ships which may from time to time be removed from the effective list of the Navy, and to urge that all such ships as are efficient for port defence and gunnery training of Colonial Navies should be put in reserve for those services in Colonial harbours."</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01057">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hesitate to trouble your Lordships, however briefly, on the occasion of a formal meeting; but the subject with which I propose to deal is urgent. Ships may be offered for sale on an early day, as to the disposal of which I submit that further consideration should be given. In dealing with the naval defence of the Empire we cannot limit our view to the home land. The requirements of the Colonies claim our consideration. The Imperial Conference lately held in London marks an epoch. The Colonies undertook for the first time to provide naval forces for local defence. They have ample resources for manning, but to build ships is costly. The Colonies require ships for the defence of their ports and coasting trade, and ships for training in gunnery. We can spare vessels suitable for all these services, vessels which, although no longer fit to lie in line, opposed to the latest types, will long continue effective in distant seas.</p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0283"/>
<col>515</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01058">I will take first the protection of harbours. The latest Navy List gives two battleships for immediate sale&#x2014;the "Edinburgh" and the "Howe." The latter was completed in 1889 at a cost of 770,000<i>l</i>., and was overhauled at Jarrow in 1904. Two more battleships&#x2014;the "Centurion" and the "Barfleur"&#x2014;completed in 1893&#x2013;4, are doomed, if there is no change of policy, to early destruction. All these vessels are heavily armoured and armed. They would be valuable for harbour defence, and especially the defence of ports such as Brisbane, Melbourne, and Adelaide, situated on inland seas. The "Centurion" and "Barfleur" steam well. They would be effective for the protection of trade. Let us not be hasty in putting such vessels on the sale list. Nor should we be reckless in the disposal of other ships completed in quite recent years. It is impossible to name all the ports of the outer Empire where battleships, not of the latest type, would be valuable. The beat of England's morning drum rolls round the world.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01059">When we come to ships more immediately preceding the Dreadnought, it is not perhaps premature to urge that they should be taken in hand in good time for such reconstruction and rearmament as may be necessary. To prolong the useful services of such ships is worth a serious effort. The battleships of the older types are valuable for other service than that of harbour defence. Gunnery ships are required in all the self-governing Colonies. On a late occasion I had the opportunity of seeing the Naval Volunteers, enrolled at Cape Town, at drill. They were fine fellows, every officer, instructor, and man being full of zeal. But they were gunners under instruction without guns. Gunnery ships are costly to build. We are able to provide them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01060">Turn to cruisers. It has been proposed to begin the creation of the local Colonial Navies by laying down cruisers. We are able to provide the vessels required. Among the ships struck off the effective list we have no fewer than eight second-class cruisers, ordered when Lord George Hamilton was at the Admiralty. They were designed by Sir William White, completed for sea in 1893, and cost &#x00A3;200,000; their speed is 20 knots; displacement, 3,600 tons; and they are armed with 6-inch guns. Let us make a
<col>516</col>
free gift of these vessels to the Colonies. The Admiralty stand pledged to co-operate with the Colonial Governments. They have explained their views and their policy in an able Memorandum. While insisting that the Imperial Navy is the best security from attack for all parts of the Empire, they recognise the importance to the Colonies of local forces always at hand. The Admiralty have declared their readiness to co-operate in providing such a flotilla. The scrapping of ships has been adopted as a measure of economy. It is better to give ships to our fellow-subjects, and thus co-operate in necessary defensive preparations, than to sell to ship-breakers. We have also to consider our own interests. I submit that to condemn ships prematurely is to weaken our position unduly in the estimate of foreign nations. The stronger the British Navy is held to be, the more effective it becomes as one of the guarantees for the peace of the world.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01061"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word first of all with regard to the procedure of the noble Lord in reference to the subject he has raised this afternoon. It is the practice of your Lordships' House that a Question or Motion that has been put down for a certain day should not be taken at an earlier date without the sanction of the House. It is not a matter of Standing Order but of practice, and I think the noble Earl who leads the House will concur that it is a rule which we should not lightly depart from.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01062"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01063"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: I do not propose to raise any objection on the present occasion; but it is obviously to the convenience of your Lordships that you should know the exact dates on which matters of this kind are to be raised. As to the merits of what the noble Lord has said, with his great knowledge of all that affects the Navy, I assume that the questions dealt with&#x2014;the questions, for instance, of guard ships in Colonial ports and training ships and to what extent vessels that are out of date in our own Navy may be of use in Colonial Navies&#x2014;were carefully considered by the Government and the Colonial I Premiers at the Imperial Conference last
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0284"/>
<col>517</col>
summer. I am not aware that requests have boon made by Colonial Governments to His Majesty's Government for old vessels of the Navy to be employed in the defence of their ports and harbours. I should have thought there were other measures more effective for such a service than the provision of ships twenty-five years old. With regard to the suggestion of the noble Lord that old vessels should be put into proper condition for fighting purposes, it is the opinion of naval experts that money is better spent in providing vessels of the latest and most efficient type than in equipping ships that are out of date. I did not rise to enter in any detail into this matter, and I hope the noble Earl who will reply will tell us what the views of His Majesty's Government are on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01064"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid I must plead guilty to being responsible for the breach of the rules of the House committed by my noble friend Lord Brassey, because it was at my suggestion that lie advanced the Notice and put it on the Paper for to-day. My noble friend has had great experience in naval matters, and we always welcome his participation in a discussion of this kind. I may say, however, in reply to him, that the whole question of the Dominions and the Navy was dealt with by the Imperial Conference. The Dominions then undertook to provide a naval force to co-operate with His Majesty's Navy in time of war. It is also the opinion of the Admiralty that shore batteries, submarines, and torpedoes are more effective for the defence of harbours than stationary guardships of the old type. I think the Dominions quite appreciate, this, for we have had no demand from them for any of these old ships. Such ships would be outdistanced by speed and in range by modern ships. Moreover, the upkeep of one of these old ships would be quite as much as, if not more than, the upkeep of a new ship. The noble Lord said that these ships would be of use to the Colonies as gunnery schools; but the modern developments of gunnery have not favoured the course of building these gunnery ships. At Portsmouth the whole of the gunnery establishment has been transferred to the shore.
<col>518</col>
Tenders are of course attached to the schools, but they possess modern equipment and modern guns.<lb/>
The noble Lord mentioned his visit to Cape Colony last year. He said the Naval Volunteers were fine fellows and full of zeal, but that they were gunners under instruction without guns. It may interest the noble Lord to know that in the last few days the Cape Government have decided to build a shore battery, as they think it more economical and useful than an old ship. Then the noble Lord touched on the question of protecting commerce. All the old cruisers that we are getting rid of are perfectly useless to protect commerce in this country, and I should think they would be equally useless in Colonial waters. The noble Lord referred to a certain class of ship&#x2014;I think they belong to the Apollo class&#x2014;which he suggested should be given over to the Colonies. The Admiralty are not anxious at present to get rid of these ships, but Canada is in negotiation for the purchase of one. There has been no demand for any of the old ships from the Colonies, and surely if they really wanted any of them they would ask the Admiralty for them.<lb/>
As your Lordships are aware, New Zealand is continuing its monetary contribution on the condition that the Imperial Navy shall station some submarines and I destroyers in those waters, which it is proposed to do in a very short time. The Commonwealth have authorised the construction of three protected cruisers, besides submarines and destroyers. One destroyer has been already launched and the construction of others is rapidly proceeding. In regard to South Africa it was thought at the Colonial Conference last year that no definite conclusion had better be come to in view of the Union. I think I have touched on most of the points raised by the noble Lord. I can only add, in conclusion, that the Admiralty do not think there is any prospect of using old ships usefully in the way suggested by my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE SUGAR CONVENTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01105"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask His Majesty's Government on what grounds "it is held but not yet settled" that under the Sugar Convention Act, 1903, an obligation exists to impose an Excise duty on sugar manufactured from home-grown beet in the United Kingdom, seeing that the Finance Act, 1901, referred to in the above Act, gives no power to impose an Excise duty on such sugar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01106"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer I have to give to the noble Earl is as follows. The duties on sugar are imposed by the Finance Act of 1901. These duties were duties of Customs and were payable on importation or delivery from warehouse. By the terms of the Sugar Convention it has become obligatory to place all sugar factories and refineries under bond, and Section 2 of the Act of 1903 provides that the bond shall secure <i>inter alia</i> the payment of duties; and, in addition, the following words occur at the end of the section&#x2014;
<quote>"The duties payable under the Finance Act, 1901, or any Act amending that Act, shall be taken on the delivery of any article from the factory or refinery and shall be the same as those payable on the like articles on importation."</quote>
Therefore we are advised that there is an obligation to impose a duty on sugar manufactured from home-grown beet, but in order to regularise the charge of such a duty there should be a Resolution of the House of Commons and the usual enactment on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0287"/>
<col>523</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01107"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord said the other day that "it is held but not yet settled." Am I to understand that it is now definitely settled that the Sugar Convention Act of 1903 and the Finance Act of 1901 include duties on home-made sugar? There is no reference therein to anything except imports.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01108"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I cannot say that it is definitely settled. I understand that there is some doubt about it, but His Majesty's Government are advised as I have stated. I believe that, shortly, the position is this. We are under legal obligation to impose a duty, but we have no legal power without legislation to collect the duty, and that is one of the reasons why special legislation would be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01109"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Is there any prospect of the point being definitely settled so that we shall know where we are?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01110"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I can assure the noble Earl that an excise duty will be imposed. Therefore he and those who think with him know exactly where they are in the matter. Of course if the noble Earl wishes I will inquire further, but it hardly seems worth while as the actual case has not arisen and is not likely to arise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01111"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Are we to understand that there is in the opinion of His Majesty's Government some doubt as to the precise position of the law, but that they have no doubt in their own minds as to the policy they mean to adopt, which would be to exact an Excise duty corresponding with the import duty at present leviable?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01112"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I believe there may be a doubt on the actual legal question, but there is no doubt that the whole tendency of the Act shows that an Excise duty must be imposed. I think that is absolutely necessary. In the section to which I referred just now it will be seen that there is a provision that the duties payable shall be taken "on the delivery of any article." I do not think that this section of the Act is very clearly drawn. "Any article" may be intended to refer to imported sugar, but it might be held to include any produce going out of the factory. In that case, of course, an Excise duty has to be imposed.</membercontribution></p>
<col>524</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01113"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: The section which the noble Lord has just quoted says, "the duties payable under the Finance Act, 1901." That refers solely to imported sugar. The only reference to any sugar deliverable from bond on which Excise would have to be charged is to glucose, molasses, and invert sugar. There is no mention whatever of the commercial article, which is the ordinary beet sugar or cane sugar. As far as I can read the Act there certainly does not appear to be any obligation whatever on His Majesty's Government to impose an Excise duty on home-made beet sugar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01114"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: Does not Lord Denman's reply come to this, that under the Convention agreed to by the late Government there is a treaty obligation upon us to impose an Excise duty, but that as no sugar has yet been made in this country there is no legislation to impose such a duty?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01115"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: Section 2 of the Act of 1903 reads that "His Majesty may by Order in Council," and so forth. That is permissive; but I am informed that when read in conjunction with Article 2 of the Sugar Convention it becomes obligatory. Therefore we should be obliged to introduce legislation to impose a duty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01116"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Lord will take the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown on the subject and let us know definitely.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01117"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl really desires it I will do so, but as there is no likelihood of the case arising it seems to me, as I said just now, hardly worth while.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01118"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: From the noble Lord's last statement I take it he thinks there is no chance of sugar being made in this country. Certainly by their present policy His Majesty's Government are doing their very best to prevent its being made here.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE BEET SUGAR INDUSTRY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01119"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call attention to the fact that representatives of Dutch sugar manufacturers are at present making contracts with farmers in the Eastern counties to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0288"/>
<col>525</col>
grow sugar-beet for shipment to factories in Holland; and to ask His Majesty's Government&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Whether this does not show conclusively that, in the opinion of practical commercial men, sugar-beet of good quality can be grown in this country.</li>
<li>2. Whether they realise the great benefits that would arise, especially to agriculture and the engineering trade, if sugar factories could be established in the British Isles; and</li>
<li>3. Whether, in view of the great need for further employment of labour, the improvement of British agriculture, and the development of industries connected therewith in rural districts, they still refuse to undertake that an Excise duty shall not be charged on home-grown sugar, and thereby give an immediate encouragement to the investment of the capital which is necessary for the successful establishment of a home sugar industry.</li>
</ol>
This is a subject to which I called your Lordships' attention four years ago. I do not think it had ever been discussed before in this House. I bring it up again now because interest in the question has developed very largely all over the country. Many people in agricultural and commercial circles have been giving it most serious consideration, and practical and experienced men have given a great deal of study to it, and are convinced that the time has fully arrived when sugar making in this country can be considered as a serious matter of business. I bring it forward as a serious business proposition and not at all in a Party spirit, and I ask His Majesty's Government to treat it in the same way. I think that His Majesty's Government have adopted a somewhat different attitude towards it in another place&#x2014;an attitude which I cannot help thinking is very regrettable. I noticed the other day that the Prime Minister was asked whether he would appoint a Committee to examine into the subject. He replied, "Oh no; the Government are very familiar with the facts"&#x2014;a remark which was received with Ministerial laughter. Then on another occasion there was more Ministerial laughter when the Chancellor of the Exchequer had made what he thought was a somewhat smart answer to a Question put to him by a member of the Opposition with regard to a factory which had been
<col>526</col>
attempted to be started at Sleaford in Lincolnshire.<lb/>
The attitude which His Majesty's Government have adopted has convinced me that they either entirely fail to appreciate the importance of the subject or regard it as some sort of Protectionist trap into which we are trying to entice them. I can assure noble Lords that it is nothing of the kind. I say once more it is a business proposition, and we ask the Government to put Party politics on one side and to treat this important matter purely from a business point of view. We have certain acknowledged evils in this country in the search for a remedy for which everybody is racking his brains. One of the chief evils is the way in which land which was once under plough has gone out of cultivation and has been laid down in grass, often of an inferior description, with the result that the rural population has dwindled very considerably and there has been great crowding into industrial centres. That is a fact so well known that I need not enlarge upon it. We have had various remedies proposed&#x2014;small holdings, labour colonies, peasant proprietorship, market gardening, French gardening, and all the rest of it; but what I want to suggest to the House is that this is really only playing with the question. The real reason why the land has gone out of cultivation in the way it has done is that agricultural profits have been so greatly decreased by the fall in prices which has taken place in recent years, and also from our failure to adapt ourselves to a proper system of agriculture to cope with the times and to the fact that we are still pursuing more or less the same system of agriculture which was pursued by our forefathers, and which I submit does not give the same results from the land which we might get if we were to adopt a totally different method.<lb/>
I am quite certain of this, that if we could establish a great industry in this country closely connected with and dependent upon the land it would do a great deal to encourage better farming; we should get better crops, we should have more land under plough, we should keep people in the country, and we should greatly increase the head of cattle kept by farmers. I am amongst those, now increasing in numbers, who believe that immerse good could be done in this direc-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0289"/>
<col>527</col>
tion if we could establish here that sugar industry which has grown to such gigantic proportions on the Continent, which has gone ahead all over the world, and which has been encouraged in every country except in England. You have only to note how it has gone ahead in America. Whereas twenty-five years ago but little beet-sugar was produced in America, last year the production had increased to 425,000 tons. Until quite recently the chief difficulty which we had to contend with was the extraordinary ignorance on the subject which prevailed everywhere. But, as I have said, interest is now rapidly awakening, and people are beginning to realise of what it is we have been depriving ourselves. Only the other day I was speaking to a well-educated farmer who occupies a very large amount of land and considers himself quite up to date in all agricultural subjects. I talked about sugar to him, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"Dear me, I had no idea that sugar was made from beet. I thought all the sugar we consumed came from cane."</quote>
Then I proceeded to give him an elementary lesson. I explained that we import every year &#x00A3;20,000,000 worth of sugar, and that of this total &#x00A3;17,000,000 worth was made from beet.<lb/>
An interesting letter was published in the Press the other day by that well-known expert and authority, Mr. George Martineau, C.B., who pointed out that&#x2014;
<quote>"Last year we imported 1,760,158 tons of sugar, of which 945,505 tons were refined beetroot sugar, 522,260 tons raw beetroot sugar, and only 292,393 tons cane sugar. Fifty years ago all our refined sugar came from our own refineries. Now our neighbours send us nearly a million tons."</quote>
Mr. Martineau went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Sixteen European countries now produce 6,499,000 tons of beetroot sugar, made from 40,929,700 tons of roots, the produce of more than 4,000,000 acres of land. I send you these brief facts because there are very few people in this country who are aware of them. During the season 1908&#x2013;9 the German factories paid dividends of twenty to thirty per cent., although raw beetroot sugar was only fetching 10<i>s</i>. per cwt. They now extract from fifteen to seventeen per cent. of sugar from the roots."</quote>
And he concluded&#x2014;
<quote>"What a magnificent industry, and our people do not even know of its existence!"</quote>
The official attitude which has been adopted in this country towards this question has been one of the most incredible stupidity and indifference, and
<col>528</col>
what is needed now is to take every opportunity to educate the public on the subject. The reason is not very far to seek. For many years foreign Governments, more far-sighted than ourselves, did all they could to foster this industry. Heavy bounties had the effect of increasing the factories; but, of course, these bounties led up to the formation of trusts or what were known as cartels. These did a great deal of harm to us in injuring our Colonial sugar industry, and when foreign nations found that the cartels were making huge profits by raising prices to their home consumers although they were able to dump their surplus stuff upon us very often at less than cost price, they began to get tired of the proceeding. We as a Free Trade country said how smart we were to always buy in the cheapest market and how stupid the foreigners were to tax themselves for our benefit. Eventually foreign nations were very glad to come to an arrangement under the Brussels Convention, and when the bounties were knocked on the head then, and not till then, did the sugar industry become practicable in the British Isles.<lb/>
But, for some reason, during those years the idea had got about that our climate was unsuited to this industry and that we could not grow beet. To show how difficult it is to eradicate that idea I would refer to the letter which appeared in the Press yesterday from Sir Walter Gilbey. Sir Walter Gilbey is a well-known agriculturist, but I am afraid he has not been keeping himself at all up to date with what has been going on in this direction. If he had he would not have drawn attention once more to the failure of a factory in Suffolk some forty years ago, and gravely put that forward as a reason why it should not be regarded as a practical industry now when the whole conditions have changed. To show that this is a serious matter of business I may mention that quite recently contracts have been attempted to be made with farmers in Lincolnshire by representatives of Dutch sugar factories to grow sugar-beet for shipment to Holland. From the information I have received in the last day or two these representatives have not been very successful, simply because the price offered was not enough. I hear from another important firm in the Eastern Counties that another foreign group are making inquiries in respect of contracts to be made
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0290"/>
<col>529</col>
for five years to grow 6,000 acres of beet, and if that can be done they say they are willing to erect a factory in this country. Of course, it all depends on the price which the farmers are able to get. I mention these things to show how matters in this direction are developing, and what a prospect there is of a great industry coming into existence if only proper encouragement is given to it.<lb/>
I come now to the business side of the subject. The first thing is to secure adequate supplies of the raw material. Farmers, and especially British farmers, are proverbially slow to move. They naturally hesitate to make contracts for crops to be grown for a term of years for the purpose of supplying the local factories which will be absolutely necessary unless the price offered is such as to make it clear to them that the profits will be substantial. That is the crux of the whole situation, but unfortunately there are many difficulties to be overcome and much money would have to be spent before the industry could be made really general. The chief difficulty is the question of labour. This is evident when you look round and see the way in which labour has left many of our arable districts. Sugar-beet cultivation requires a great deal of labour. I expect high wages will have to be paid to attract people back, and cottages will have to be erected by the local factories. All this, of course, adds to the amount of money required and makes it more difficult to obtain the capital necessary for the industry. Districts vary very much. In some districts where labour is plentiful and where the soil is good, farmers no doubt could make a very good thing indeed if they could obtain from 19<i>s</i>. to 20<i>s</i>. a ton for their roots, and I do not think the growing of them under such conditions should exceed from &#x00A3;9 to &#x00A3;10 an acre. If they are able to get sixteen tons to the acre, as experience has shown they ought to be able to get on good land, the net profit to them ought to come out at about &#x00A3;6 an acre; and I respectfully submit to those of your Lordships who are practical agriculturists that that is a profit which ought to be very attractive indeed in these days.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the capital necessary for the factories, which ought to be of sufficient size to handle from 30,000 to 40,000 tons of roots. The amount
<col>530</col>
required for each factory would be about &#x00A3;100,000 more or less according to circumstances. It is not easy to get this money for a new and unknown industry, and although you may abuse the investor as much as yon like and say he ought to come forward as a patriot, he will not put his money in unless he sees a good return, and the newer the enterprise the more difficult it is to get money unless the prospects are very good. But with proper encouragement I am certain that money would be forthcoming. I am equally confident that the important landowners of this country would come forward and take a hand in this industry, which ought to be largely one of co-operation between them and the farmers. At the same time I would respectfully suggest to His Majesty's Government that it does not make it easier to obtain capital for rural industries of this description, it does not help the cause of local industries, when landowners are solemnly informed that it is part of the settled policy of His Majesty's Government to tax them out of existence, and that a start in that direction has already been made. As far as I can make out, the general opinion is, from Continental experience, that the cost of making on the basis of paying &#x00A3;1 per ton for the roots would be from 8<i>s</i>. to 9<i>s</i>. per cwt. The present price of raw sugar&#x2014;f.o.b. Hamburg&#x2014;is 14<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. per cwt. But that price is altogether abnormal; it is caused by the bad crops of last year and by the considerable amount of speculation that has been going on. That the price is unusually high is shown by the fact that the quotations for delivery of the next crop, in October, are 3<i>s</i>. per cwt. less. If we could jump right away into a well-organised industry there is a good profit between sugar made at a cost of 8<i>s</i>. or 9<i>s</i>. per cwt. and sold at from 10<i>s</i>. to 11<i>s</i>., which may be taken as the normal price of raw sugar. At the same time the margin is not large, and if you are going to make home sugar pay an Excise duty of 2<i>s</i>. a cwt. and it has to compete on equal terms with a highly-developed Continental industry, that margin may be difficult to obtain in the initial stage; because, of course, a new industry cannot be run as economically as a settled one.<lb/>
It is, therefore, absolutely necessary, if this industry is really to go ahead, that it should be made more attractive; and what I have asked His Majesty's Govern
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0291"/>
<col>531</col>
ment to do is to come to an agreement on their part&#x2014;I am certain that it would be come to on our side&#x2014;that no Excise duty should be charged for a period of time. This at once would have the effect of adding about 2<i>s</i>. a cwt., or &#x00A3;2 a ton, to the profits derivable, and in the case of a factory of the type that was proposed at Sleaford that would mean about &#x00A3;9,000 a year, or seven per cent. on the capital, and that naturally would make the proposition very much more attractive to investors. If capital could really be obtained, what this would mean should be carefully thought over. I will take leave to read to your Lordships a note which I circulated to some noble Lords in this House dealing with that particular point. In this note I say&#x2014;
<quote>"If we ourselves only grew one-quarter of the &#x00A3;20,000,000 worth of sugar that we import, we should require over 100 factories of the size of the one recently contemplated at Sleaford. Some thousands of men would get employment, most of them unskilled men, who now find it hard to obtain work in the winter. Fully &#x00A3;6,000,000 worth of plant alone would be erected, without counting the cost of buildings. Much money would be spent on upkeep and renewals. Mechanics, engineers, and fitters would be wanted in large numbers for an industry that would rapidly spread and which to-day is non-existent. Engineering firms would manufacture a highly specialised plant for which in this country there is no demand at present. Collieries and railways would benefit, whilst hundreds of thousands of bags would be wanted for the sugar. Sugar refineries would once more look up and much employment would be provided there. New methods of agriculture would be necessary, intensive cultivation would increase, and the general fertility of the land would improve."</quote>
I know perfectly well the objections which will be raised by His Majesty's Government. I shall be told first of all that they are a Free Trade Government, that this is Protection pure and simple, and that therefore no matter what good it may do to the country they cannot have anything to do with it and it is no use looking to them. If that is the main reply of His Majesty's Government, all I can say is that as a Tariff Reformer I cannot wish for a better text to preach from; and when the country really realises what the sugar industry is and that all that is needed at the present moment is capital and organisation, and when the country learns that nothing but Free Trade principles are preventing the provision of this capital in adequate quantities, I do not think that it will do the cause of Free Trade very much good. I cannot imagine anything more likely to increase what I would
<col>532</col>
describe as the growing unpopularity of Free Trade principles. But what I ask His Majesty's Government to do is to treat this on the principle laid down by Mr. John Stuart Mill in that well-known passage where he spoke of its being quite compatible with Free Trade principles to afford temporary protection to what he described as infant industries. I quoted these words four years ago in your Lordships' House, and with your permission I should like to do so again. Mr. Mill said&#x2014;
<quote>"The only case in which, on mere principles of political economy, protective duties can be defensible, is when they are imposed temporarily (especially in a young and rising nation) in hopes of naturalising a foreign industry, in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country. The superiority of one country over another in a branch of production often arises only from having begun it sooner. There may be no inherent advantage on one part, or disadvantage on the other, but only a present superiority of acquired skill and experience. A country which has this skill and experience yet to acquire may in other respects be better adapted to the production than those which were earlier in the field."</quote>
And he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"A protecting duty continued for a reasonable time will sometimes be the least inconvenient mode in which the nation can tax itself for the support of such an experiment. But the protection should be confined to cases in which there is good ground of assurance that the industry which it fosters will after a time be able to dispense with it&#x2014;</quote>
I fully admit that, my Lords&#x2014;
<quote>"nor should the domestic producers ever be allowed to expect that it will be continued to them beyond a time necessary for a fair trial of what they are capable of accomplishing."</quote>
That, my Lords, is all I am asking. Although Great Britain cannot be described as a young and rising country, still the particular industry to which I am referring is accurately described in those words of Mr. Mill. Therefore I submit to His Majesty's Government that although they are a Free Trade Administration they can, if they believe in those doctrines, perfectly well come forward and give the encouragement and help we are asking for at the present moment.<lb/>
Then perhaps it may be asked, Where are we to stop? That is your affair, my Lords. Mr. Mill no doubt had that in his mind fully when he wrote the passage which I have quoted. You can lay it down as much as you like that this is to be only a temporary encouragement confined to this one particular industry.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0292"/>
<col>533</col>
What we want to stop is the starvation and unemployment now existing; we want to stop land going out of cultivation; we want to stop people going to the towns; we want to stop the rot which has been going on in agriculture. I am not pretending for one moment that that particular industry is going to do all that, but I do maintain in the strongest terms that it will go a very long way in this direction. Then perhaps you will say that if the Dutch can afford to pay 6<i>s</i>. per ton for freight on roots to be taken from Lincolnshire to Holland, why would not it pay if the sugar was made here. I do not say it would not pay in certain circumstances where everything is favourable, but there is all the difference in the world between an established industry run by people who understand it and a new one such as ours would be. The Dutch have their factories in existence at the present moment, prices are favourable, and the Dutch being smart men of business and having their plant running are naturally anxious to obtain as much raw material as possible.<lb/>
I hardly think the Government will raise the objection I have seen put forward in the Press that the adoption of my suggestion would have the effect of raising the price of sugar. That is so obviously absurd that I am certain His Majesty's Government will not put that argument forward. An import duty exists at the present moment, and if this proposal had any effect at all on the price of sugar it could only have the effect of tending to reduce the price, because you would increase your supplies and you would have sugar on the market here which had not had to pay freight from the Continent. But I think the silliest criticism I have seen appeared a few days ago in the <i>Star</i> newspaper. In it the writer referred to a letter that had appeared in the Press from a gentleman who told how he had seen children in Germany employed in large numbers in the fields for the purpose of singling out the young beet plants, and described how the school holidays are arranged for the purpose and how the children are taken out in large carts and thoroughly enjoy themselves and earn money. The <i>Star</i> gravely put forward the argument that the establishment of the sugar industry here would mean an evasion of the Factory Acts. I would only point out that here in England,
<col>534</col>
as you well know, whole families, men, women, and children, go into the country hop-picking and fruit-picking. Why should it be an evasion of the Factory Acts to employ them on like labour in beet fields? Surely the employment of women in this work, even if imported labour from the towns had to be resorted to at the time when hoeing and singling wanted a lot of attention, would be a more healthy occupation than for them to work in cotton and other mills. Then perhaps I shall be told that there would be a serious loss of revenue. I remember that point afflicted my noble, friend Lord Denman very much on a former occasion. But if as many as a hundred factories were in existence the loss of revenue, as nearly as I can calculate it, would be about &#x00A3;750,000, and&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01120"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: A year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01121"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Yes. It would take from 400 to 500 factories to give us the whole of our sugar supplies, and I think the revenue derived from sugar at the present moment is about &#x00A3;3,000,000. Supposing we lost &#x00A3;750,000 a year, a good deal would come back in Income Tax and general prosperity; and I submit that if the industry could be established the money would be well spent in doing so, and in obtaining the increased employment which the Government are now doing all they can to secure through the means of their expensive Labour Exchanges with their well-salaried staffs.<lb/>
What are the Government going to do if sugar is manufactured? That was the purport of the Question which I put to them at the beginning of this debate. Do they intend solemnly to bring in a Bill for the purpose of putting a tax on home-made sugar and doing what they can practically to stifle an infant industry? If so, I am afraid they will have a rather warm time of it, and they will find that it will be a very unpopular move. I have no doubt that some of their supporters would say that the obvious remedy is to drop the present sugar duty. I remember in the days of my youth being told a somewhat lurid story of a man who was very fond of eating crumpets, by which he used to make himself extremely ill. The doctor told him that if he went on he would kill himself. He asked how many crumpets it would take to kill him&#x2014;whether thirty or forty. The doctor replied
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0293"/>
<col>535</col>
that that number would make him very ill. Well, would eighty kill him? The doctor thought that eighty would. The story goes that the man consumed eighty crumpets and promptly blew out his brains to prove that the doctor was wrong. If His Majesty's Government immediately throw away &#x00A3;3,000,000 of revenue in order to make it impossible for anyone to say that Protection had ever done any good in this country, I think their action would be somewhat analogous to that of the hero of that little story. But I am bound to say that when we find the Government borrowing money at two and a-half per cent.&#x2014;their own money, money which is owed to them and which they could get for the asking&#x2014;and doing so for the purpose of trying to show that somebody else was wrong, it is no use prophesying what they would not be likely to do.<lb/>
I would make a particular appeal to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture. I did so on a former occasion. I think that the action of his Department in this particular instance has been most disappointing. The Board of Agriculture no doubt do a great work. They keep us free from rabies, they prevent the spread of cattle disease, they circulate valuable information with regard to the bugs and beetles which destroy our crops, and they keep an eye generally on agricultural matters. I believe they have a certain amount of valuable information with regard to the sugar-beet industry. But why do they sit on it? When I first called the noble Earl's attention to this matter four years ago, I do not think I am wrong in saying that he had not paid very much attention to it up to that time. I do not think he in any way fully appreciated what the sugar industry is. He has learnt more now no doubt, and must be aware of what is being done abroad; and if he has since acquired any proper appreciation of what it means and of its magnitude, I ask him why cannot he show some initiative and some enterprise in the matter. Why does he not send down his apostles from the Board of Agriculture to instruct the farmers and call the attention of the agricultural community to what might be done? Why should it be left to private individuals like myself to call attention to it? Why cannot it be backed up by the weight of a Government Department? It would be in any other country. The great sugar industry in
<col>536</col>
Germany would never have been built up as it has been had it not been for the interest and care which the German Government displayed.<lb/>
I apologise for having detained your Lordships so long. I dare say a good deal of what I have said is repetition, perhaps repetition <i>ad nauseam</i>, of what has been said before; but unfortunately it is generally the case that when you want to attract attention to a particular subject the only way to do so successfully is by repetition. All I ask is that noble Lords who are interested in this matter will give it their kind attention and support, and that they will lose no opportunity of interesting the commercial and business community in the matter and of doing all they can to give a start to the foundation of an industry which would do a great amount of good in our English country districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01122"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that no one who is aware of the keen interest which the noble Earl has taken in this question, and the enthusiasm with which he has advocated the cultivation of sugar beet in this country, can be surprised that he has taken an early opportunity of initiating a discussion on the subject in the present Parliament; and in the able speech to which we have just listened he has stated his case with that clearness and cogency to which we are accustomed in these debates. The noble Earl has raised the question on several occasions in recent years, on one of which it became my duty to reply for His Majesty's Government. I ventured on that occasion to allude to the noble Earl as an enthusiast, and to my surprise&#x2014;I may say to my amazement&#x2014;the noble Earl rose in his place and took that to mean that I had alluded to him as a crank. I think "crank" was the word he used. May I say that nothing was further from my thoughts then and nothing is further from my thoughts now. I have a great respect and admiration for enthusiasts. I recollect the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition alluding on more than one occasion to my noble friend behind me, the President of the Board of Agriculture, as an enthusiast, and I am quite sure he did not for one moment desire to imply that my noble friend was a crank Therefore if I again venture to allude to the noble Earl as an enthusiast I hope he will understand that I do so in a perfectly respectful and even complimentary sense.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0294"/>
<col>537</col>
The noble Earl has given us many figures to show that the question of the cultivation of sugar beet in this country has made considerable strides since he first raised it in your Lordships' House&#x2014;a fact that I do not for one moment dispute. I will endeavour to deal with the more argumentative side of the question he has put forward. In spite of the suspicion with which the noble Earl regards His Majesty's present advisers, I really believe that their aims and objects in this matter are not, after all, so very different from those of the noble Earl. For his contention, as I understand it, is something of this kind. He says to us&#x2014;Here is a chance of introducing an entirely new industry into this country, an industry which will have excellent results for British agriculture, which will not only benefit agriculturists but manufacturers as well, which will enable higher wages to be paid in rural districts and more land to be put under plough, which will involve a large demand for new plant and new machinery, which will give employment&#x2014;as I understand the noble Earl's contention&#x2014;in the winter months when employment is always at its worst, and which may attract considerable numbers to parts of the country that are at the present time sparsely populated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01123"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01124"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree that these are powerful inducements, and that this is a case which would merit the earnest consideration of any Government. But I must say I do rather take exception to the way in which the noble Earl speaks of His Majesty's present advisers as being entirely indifferent to the interests of agriculture in this country. I would point to their record during the last four years to prove the contrary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01125"><member>The EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: I only complained of their indifference upon this particular question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01126"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to hear that. I can assure the noble Earl that we are desirous of doing anything in our power to realise the very inviting prospects which he holds out to us in connection with this industry. It is when we come to the particular means by which we are expected to assist it that we have to part company with the noble Earl. His whole point is, I gather, that the only way in
<col>538</col>
which we can assist is by not imposing an Excise duty equivalent to the tax on sugar imported into this country&#x2014;that is to say, that we should not at the present time impose any Excise duty on sugar at all. I should have thought, if the prospects were really so excellent as the noble Earl has contended, that the industry could be established without requiring any such remission of duty.<lb/>
The noble Earl has repeated arguments which he has used on former occasions, and it is not my fault if I have to recapitulate the arguments on my side against the contention he has put forward. The noble Earl, I know, is somewhat impatient of Free Trade principles, and he quotes to us again Mill's doctrine with regard to infant industries&#x2014;that infant industries could be encouraged without a violation of Free Trade principles. If I had his expert knowledge of the fiscal question I think I could quote from the writings of economists to show that of all the doctrines which Mill put forward this one was the most open to question and to criticism. I think I can quote an authority to which the noble Earl will attach possibly greater importance than myself&#x2014;namely, the authority of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. When this question was first raised in your Lordships' House the noble Marquess said that this doctrine must be received with very great caution indeed, that these industries somehow acquire the secret of eternal youth, and that people engaged in them always have innumerable reasons when the time comes for the rebate or whatever it is to be removed why it should be maintained. I think the noble Earl himself conceded that point. He said we might ask him where this encouragement is to stop; but he added that that was not his affair at all but our affair. The noble Earl asks us to impose no Excise duty for an indefinite number of years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01127"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Not necessarily indefinite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01128"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble Earl give me an indication of bow many years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01129"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Five or six years would help very much.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01130"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: The last time I asked him it was five or ten years; it is always rather difficult to pin the noble Earl down on this point.</membercontribution></p>

<col>539</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01131"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: You can pin me down to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01132"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: But it is obvious that once granted a thing like this becomes extremely difficult to withdraw. Suppose a great industry is built up, then it necessarily follows that this must be so. This was made clear the other day. A deputation came to see the Financial Secretary of the Treasury on this matter, and one of the gentlemen who put forward the case was asked by my right hon. friend whether this arrangement would be permanent or for how many years he would ask for a remission of Excise duty, and he replied that he only wanted it for a certain number of years but that at the end of that time he would ask leave to renew his application to the Treasury. So that the whole thing is very indefinite, and a remission of duty once granted would be extremely difficult to withdraw. Again, there is this argument. The sugar duty under Free Trade finance has been reduced by more than half during the last four years. A Chancellor of the Exchequer who is in a happier financial position than my right hon. friend is at present might desire to repeal that duty altogether. Sugar is almost a necessary of life, and I think that a future Chancellor of the Exchequer might be desirous of repealing the duty altogether; but if you are giving this rebate on the Excise it would prevent that course being taken, and the whole community may suffer in consequence. The noble Earl mentioned &#x00A3;750,000 a year as a sum which the Revenue might expect to lose for five or six years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01133"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: I was taking a supposititious case. I said that supposing one hundred factories were working that would probably represent about a quarter of our consumption. Of course it would take some time before one hundred factories could be set going.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01134"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: But that, I take it, is the aim of the noble Earl, and I gather that &#x00A3;750,000 a year is what it might cost the Revenue in certain circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01135"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: It would be well laid out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01136"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: That may be so; but I should have thought that this is scarcely an opportune moment to approach the Government with a proposal of that kind, when, owing to the action of your Lord
<col>540</col>
ships in rejecting the Budget last year, there is a deficit of something like &#x00A3;26,250,000 in last year's Revenue. I think it is unlikely that the Revenue will be particularly elastic for some years to come. Again I notice a rather important discrepancy in the figures given by the noble Earl. He said just now&#x2014;I do not wish to make any point of this&#x2014;that beet sugar could be cultivated in this country at the rate of sixteen tons to the acre. When he approached this matter before he told us that the amount which might be reasonably expected was thirteen tons to the acre, and that in Germany the average quantity was twelve tons. That is rather an important discrepancy to any one who is desirous of seeing this industry established on a paying basis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01137"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: The later figures are the result of the knowledge gained by further experience. I wanted to be on the safe side before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01138"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I quite accept that. I have said before, and I repeat it now, that in our view it would be preferable to not imposing the Excise duty to propose that a subsidy should be voted in Parliament, and I suggest that the noble Earl and his friends should bring this subject forward in another place. I do not say that it is likely that His Majesty's Government will assent, but we consider that it is better to vote a subsidy for this purpose than to adopt the noble Earl's proposal, because, after all, when a definite sum of money is voted then the Government are in a position to know exactly where they are. But once you allow a rebate on the Excise there is no knowing where the thing may end. There remains one other possible alternative which I do think is worthy of the consideration of the noble Earl and those who seek to establish this industry here. A Bill was passed last year which provided for a Development Grant. That grant&#x2014;again I am afraid I have to mention owing to the rejection of the Budget by your Lordships' House&#x2014;will only be this year about half what it otherwise would have been, but still there will be a considerable sum at the disposal of the Development Commissioners.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01142"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I assume that there will be a sum of about &#x00A3;400,000 in the Development Grant during the course of this year, and I suggest to the noble Earl that this is precisely one of those cases where those interested in this particular industry might approach the Commissioners with a view to seeing whether some assistance might be rendered them. The noble Earl dwelt on other inviting and no doubt very interesting topics. He spoke, I think, of the incredible stupidity of the Government in not having acceded to his request long ago. He spoke of the way in which we are "taxing landowners out of existence," and he had a backhander, in passing, at the Labour Exchange Act. I will not endeavour to follow him in any of these inviting topics. If I may say so, the mind of the noble Earl always seems to be swayed in this matter by two powerful emotions&#x2014;one is affection for sugar beet and the other is dislike of His Majesty's Government; and I always take a keen interest in watching which will be the uppermost sentiment. The noble Earl made one rather startling observation. He said that were a Tariff Reform Government in power he would have no doubt that no Excise duty would be imposed. I am not quite so certain about that. Supposing that in the dim and distant future a Tariff Reform Government is in power and that they occupy the Benches where we now sit, I doubt very much whether that would come to pass. I will tell the noble Earl why. I have listened very carefully in these discussions to what has been said by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and I have noticed that he has always been very careful never to commit himself to any such promise. In fact, reading between the lines, though the noble Marquess is favourable to the establishment of the industry in this country I am doubtful whether he would encourage it in the particular way desired by the noble Earl. If the noble Marquess takes part in this discussion later on I hope that he may afford the House some information on that particular point. I trust I have shown that it is impossible for us to grant the particular form of assistance which the noble Earl desires; but I fail to see why that should be a bar&#x2014;I sincerely hope that it may not be a bar&#x2014;to the establishment of the sugar beet industry in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<col>542</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01143"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that as a moderate reformer, and, I hope, a prudent financier, I am horrified at the spendthrift views which have just been announced by His Majesty's Government. My noble friend Lord Denbigh asks the Government to do nothing. In order that a particular industry may be encouraged he asks them to refrain from imposing an Excise duty. What does the noble Lord who represents the Government say in reply to that? After explaining the state of the finances of His Majesty's Government and alluding to the large deficit in the Exchequer, he says that His Majesty's Government prefer a direct system of bounties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01144"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I did not quite say that. I said that it seems to me better than the suggestion of the noble Earl, but I did not say that we should assent to it or that we were in favour of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01145"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I understood the noble Lord almost to invite the noble Earl to enunciate proposals for a direct system of bounties. He certainly did give a very definite invitation to my noble friend to approach the Commissioners of the Development Fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01146"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01147"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I have no doubt that that is a very desirable way of doing things, and that the noble Earl's friends may get some satisfaction from the Development Commissioners, but I do think it is a most extravagant way; whereas to merely remit the Excise duty or a portion of the Excise duty for a short period need not cost very much. The noble Lord, I think, misunderstood the figures which Lord Denbigh gave as regards the loss to the Exchequer which would be involved by the remission of the Excise duty. If an industry is so satisfactorily established that its output would be paying an Excise duty of &#x00A3;750,000 a year it would then be reasonable for His Majesty's Government to say that the industry stood in need of no protection whatever. If the annual output of the sugar industry in this country amounted to one-quarter of the whole consumption, as it would in that case, it would be reasonable to say that the industry should bear an Excise duty equal to the import duty charged. Though there might be a
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0297"/>
<col>543</col>
slight loss to the Revenue during the first five years or so, I do not imagine that if the small concession asked for resulted in the establishment of the industry His Majesty's Government need anticipate any ultimate diminution of Revenue but rather an increase, owing to the additional direct and indirect employment that would be caused.<lb/>
The noble Lord well realises that I would not shrink from advocating a measure of the most extreme Protection, but in this particular case this is not a question of extreme Protection; it is not what I should understand by Protection at all. The question between the two sides of the House is not a very large one; the line which divides us is very narrow; I think it is something to have got general agreement that this industry is without dispute one which it would be beneficial to the agricultural community in this country to establish, and which would provide a considerable amount of employment. I ask the Government whether they cannot, consistently with their Free Trade principles, which are not in question, and consistently with certain actions which they have already taken, make this very small concession on the chance of establishing a great and important industry in this country. I am not going to use the infant industry argument. That is no doubt an admission on the part of John Stuart Mill which can be used to nullify almost every Free Trade argument which that distinguished Free Trader used. I do not for one moment use that argument. But I do say that what His Majesty's Government are being asked to do now is no more than they themselves did when they introduced the Patent Laws Amendment Act, which is certainly not strictly in accordance with Free Trade principles as understood by the early Cobdenites. In fact they are only asked to carry out literally what they themselves have already done, what they did when they re-enacted the Sugar Convention. In that Convention it is allowed that there should be a certain money difference between the import duty and the Excise duty. The whole principle of the Convention was that there should be half-a-crown difference between the Excise duty and the import duty, and so long as that difference is not greater than half-a-crown any arrangement may be made by the different Governments who were parties to the Convention. I do not understand
<col>544</col>
how, in the face of that distinct principle underlying the Convention, it can be contended by His Majesty's advisers that it is absolutely necessary to impose an Excise duty equivalent to the full import duty.<lb/>
The noble Lord said that this is a question which has not been finally cleared up. I hope it will be cleared up soon. I was a member of the other House at the time when the Sugar Convention became an Act. I took considerable part in the discussions upon it; and throughout the whole of the proceedings the principle which was understood to guide us was that there should be this difference of half-a-crown allowed between the Excise and the import duty. Surely it is possible for this Government to act up to that principle the same as other parties to the Convention are allowed to act. That is all that the noble Earl asks. If His Majesty's Government do not choose to act in that way there is another way in which they can act. It is a common feature of the Revenue system of this country when articles are manufactured under supervision to charge a small duty as Excise duty&#x2014;a duty smaller than the full amount of the import duty&#x2014;because of the cost to the manufacturer involved in warehousing and so forth under supervision. It would at any rate be reasonable, if His Majesty's Government did not see their way to remit the whole of the Excise duty, to consider the propriety of making the same allowance as is done in the case of tobacco.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01148"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: We have already definitely promised to do exactly what the noble Viscount asks.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01150"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I think the point the noble Viscount is on is the cost of supervision and collection to the manufacturer, and we have promised that a rebate of about five per cent will be allowed to manufacturers in respect of that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01151"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: That is not a very large allowance, but still I am glad to hear how far His Majesty's Government are ready to go. Then, after all, it is only going a little further to ask the Government not to impose a tax. It is the imposition of a tax which horrifies a Free Trader so much. We are not asking for
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0298"/>
<col>545</col>
the imposition of a tax. We are asking the Government to refrain from imposing a tax, thereby strictly carrying out the policy of <i>laissez faire</i> by which they have been animated. What have the Government done in the matter of tobacco growing in Ireland? They have allowed a rebate in regard to tobacco grown in Ireland on the ground, as I understand, that it is an infant industry, though I see from a report issued yesterday that last year 133 acres were under cultivation and 126,195 lbs. of tobacco were grown. I know that the Government have contended that it is as an experiment that these rebates have been granted to tobacco growers in Ireland. The noble Lord who replied for the Government said that a rebate once granted is difficult to withdraw. May I ask why that principle is to apply with greater force to the prospect of beet sugar growing in England than to tobacco growing in Ireland? If the experiment can be safely made in Ireland with regard to tobacco, why can it not be made in England with regard to beet sugar? I agree that once you establish an industry there is an inclination on the part of those concerned in that industry to keep every possible concession they can; but, granting that to the full, is it not exactly the same in this country as in Ireland? I know that Ireland can secure special treatment from His Majesty's Government, and I would suggest to my noble friend Lord Denbigh that perhaps the best way of approaching this subject and securing what is now asked for is not to agitate among farmers in Lincolnshire but to get a few acres of sugar beet under cultivation in the district for which the Member for Waterford sits. There are certain agencies in Ireland which seem able to move His Majesty's Government to break all their most cherished principles. They are prepared to take the chance of not being able to withdraw the rebate in the case of Ireland, and I must say that, with the kind of influence which His Majesty's Government are liable to at the present juncture, the chance of that rebate being stopped in Ireland seems to be singularly small. If the Government do not take the little step that they are asked to take, and if the prospect of a great and flourishing industry, which even the Government themselves have described as an industry which would be of great advantage to the country, is lost in consequence, I hope the farmers and people of Lincolnshire will be told by the noble
<col>546</col>
Earl exactly how the matter stands: that the Government, not because they disbelieved in the industry, not because they did not think that what they were asked to do would encourage agriculture, but on pure principle, have refused to do for the British farmer what they have willingly done for the Irish small holder.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01152"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been greatly interested in the speech of the noble Earl who brought this subject forward, and in the speech of the noble Viscount who has just sat down. It is always very pleasant, especially for us who sit on this side of the House, to get at first hand the doctrine of the Tariff Reformer from a pure source. So far as I understand, the case is this, that there are capitalists who are willing to establish a sugar factory in Lincolnshire if they can get a definite pledge from the Government and the Opposition that they will be free from Excise duty for a certain number of years; and the noble Earl told us that in his opinion the capitalists would probably be contented with a pledge of this sort which would hold good for from five to seven years. The noble Lord who replied for the Government has pointed out that it would be very difficult for the Government to give this encouragement, even if on its merits they were in favour of it, because they are pledged to remove whenever they can the remaining duty on sugar. His Majesty's Government have been in office four years and have taken off half the duty; the remnant of that duty is now only about &#x00BC;<i>d</i>. a lb. It is obvious, therefore, that the Government are hardly in a position to assist anybody by saying they will not charge an Excise duty; and, of course, such a promise is of no advantage to a manufacturer if the import duty on foreign sugar is taken off. The noble Earl says that sugar can be grown in this country if the home producer is given some advantage over the foreign producer; but, as I have said, the Government are under a pledge to remove as soon as possible the import duty. Both noble Lords opposite spoke of this as a matter of electioneering. They said they would go to the agricultural districts and say that a Free Trade Government would do nothing, and that the farmers knew what a Tariff Reform Government would do. As we have the noble Lords here who are largely responsible for the Tariff Reform movement, now is the time to get further information on the subject. I have read their speeches
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0299"/>
<col>547</col>
with the greatest possible interest, and I think I understand their general scheme. When they get into power they intend to put a tax on foreign manufactured articles, on corn, on meat, and on various other things, but they do not mean the consumer in this country to suffer at all. They mean to take with one hand, but to give the consumer the equivalent on the other. And what have they promised? I am under the impression that I have read speeches delivered by the noble Viscount in which he has said that the Tariff Reform party want to take off the taxes on tea, coffee, and sugar. If that is so, then what advantage are you going to give your friend the capitalist in this matter if you remove the duty on sugar?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01153"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I am quite certain the noble Lord will never find that I said I thought it possible to take off all the taxes on the articles he mentioned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01154"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Viscount has not done so I am sure many of his friends have. It is one of the favourite promises given at village meetings. As the tax on sugar is only &#x00BC;<i>d</i>. on the lb. it would be difficult to take off a portion of that; and if that duty is removed no advantage could be given to the home producer by the adoption of the noble Earl's suggestion. Therefore I think noble Lords opposite might tell us whether they intend to drop out of their programme the promise to take off the sugar duty in order to give this advantage to farmers in the eastern counties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01155"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Not in the eastern counties only. I particularly said that I wanted to see it become a general industry all over the country. I said that although sugar beet might be grown in the eastern counties where everything was favourable, I did not think it would be possible to get the capital to make the industry general unless encouragement was given in the way I suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01156"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S</member><membercontribution>: I live in Wales where the greater part of the land is old grass land which could not be broken up for this industry, and I think noble Lords from Ireland would say that the greater part of the grass lands in that country are equally unsuitable. The difference between tobacco grown in Ireland and sugar
<col>548</col>
beet is that the Treasury will never be able to do without a duty on tobacco, and it is possible to agree to give a rebate. In the case of beet sugar the promise that there would be no Excise duty imposed would be of little value, for both Parties are pledged to remove the remaining duties on sugar. If those duties were removed, the absence of an Excise duty would be of no value to the home industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01157"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend who initiated this discussion has at any rate been successful to this extent, that he has elicited from the noble Lord who represents His Majesty's Government an admission that this question is one of very great national importance, and deserves, I think the expression he used was, attentive examination. He even, I think, got a little more than that out of him, because we gather that His Majesty's Government have gone the length of promising as an inducement to those who may think of establishing beet sugar factories a rebate which I am given to understand would work out at the princely and magnificent sum of 2<i>s</i>. a ton. I do not know whether my noble friend will consider that that will be at all an adequate inducement to capitalists who may have it in contemplation to start these sugar factories in this country.<lb/>
There can be no doubt&#x2014;I do not think it will be contested by noble Lords opposite&#x2014;that this idea of establishing the beet sugar industry in this country is an extremely attractive one. It has many attractive features: the crop raised is very profitable, the raising of the crop tends to good cultivation of the land, and, above all, to the employment of a large number of hands, and last but not least, the by-products of the manufacture are extremely useful for cattle-feeding. I think all these things have to be borne in mind at the present time when both political Parties are committeed to the policy of encouraging small holdings. I cannot conceive any kind of agriculture which would fit in better with a system of small holdings than the cultivation of the sugar beet. The noble Lord opposite asks why, if this industry presents such magnificent and attractive prospects, it is necessary to support it by means of the kind of encouragement for which my noble friend asks. I think there is a very obvious answer to that. The reason we on this side
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0300"/>
<col>549</col>
think that some encouragement of the kind is reasonable and desirable is that owing to the prevalence of the bounty system in foreign countries the beet sugar industry has now been so firmly established on the Continent of Europe, and those engaged in that industry have obtained so long a start, that it really would be asking too much of our agriculturists to rush into the field of competition unless they got some encouragement during the early inception of the movement.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred, I think not for the first time, to John Stuart Mill's famous dictum with regard to the encouragement of infant industries, and he proceeded, rather to my surprise, to quote me as an authority on the other side. The noble Lord, I think, quoted me accurately. I believe I did say that I had always regarded this particular doctrine of Mill's as one which it was necessary to apply with the greatest caution, and the reason I gave was, as the noble Lord said, that these infant industries if you encourage them over much are apt to find out the secret of eternal youth and to go on insisting upon a continuation of the official assistance which you had given them at the outset. That is a perfectly reasonable caution, and I do not in the least regret having made the statement. But surely everything depends upon whether the industry which you are going to dry nurse, if I may use the expression, is an exotic industry, an artificial industry which is not really suitable and adapted to the circumstances of the country, or whether, on the contrary, it is one which, when once launched, is likely to be able to take care of itself. If you dry nurse what I would call an exotic industry you will certainly find that it will call for a continuation of the stimulating treatment which you had given it at first.<lb/>
But the whole point of my noble friend's case is this, that when once you have got these factories started, with all their expensive plant and surroundings, the sugar beet industry would take care of itself, and I think the noble Lord quite misapprehended what was said by Lord Denbigh as to the cost of the particular measure which he proposed. The noble Lord opposite was under the impression that my noble friend was asking for a subvention of &#x00A3;750,000 a year for five or six years. It is quite obvious that, if you were to grant the remission of the Excise duty to-morrow,
<col>550</col>
it would be a long time before these new factories would begin to earn the right to a remission of anything like a substantial sum. By the time they could claim a remission of &#x00A3;750,000 of Excise duty they would be fairly upon their legs, and it would be quite natural and proper to tell them that the moment had come when they could no longer be regarded as infant industries and when they must shift for themselves.<lb/>
I gather from the noble Lord opposite that, in principle, his colleagues are not altogether averse to the idea of doing something if they can to encourage the cultivation of the sugar beet. The noble Lord mentioned reasons for which in his view the particular proposal of my noble friend&#x2014;I mean the remission of the Excise duty&#x2014;was inadmissible. So far as what I may describe as the international argument is concerned, the argument based upon the Sugar Convention, I fail altogether to see that any case can be made against the remission of the duty. So long as the import duty remains below half-a-crown a cwt. we are, as I understand the matter, entirely at liberty to grant a bounty in any shape or form that does not exceed that sum. Then the noble Lord came to a section which he quoted in the Act of 1903. I did not quite follow the noble Lord's explanation. I understood him to say that His Majesty's Government were still doubtful as to the strict legal interpretation to be put upon the clause. If that is so, surely the obvious rejoinder is&#x2014;let them take the high legal advice which they can always obtain, and if they are advised that the section does bear that particular interpretation then let them consider whether or not they will resort to the necessary legislation in order to enable them to do what is desired. But I gather that their objection is not really based at all upon the legal difficulty, but upon the question of policy raised by the proposal of my noble friend.<lb/>
I am bound to say that it does not seem to me to follow in the least that because you wish to do something to introduce this new industry you can only to do it by means of a remission of the Excise duty. There are obviously other ways of achieving the purpose, and my noble friend Lord Ridley made a most apposite suggestion when he called attention to the fact that in Ireland the cultivation of tobacco is at this moment being encouraged by His Majesty's Gov-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0301"/>
<col>551</col>
ernment by means of an allowance of moderate amount. Why should not a similar allowance, but on a scale sufficiently liberal to really permit of the experiment being conducted&#x2014;why should not an allowance of that kind be made in the case of the cultivation of beet sugar? I have myself had the privilege of visiting a tobacco farm in Ireland owned by a member of this House. I am not a smoker myself and am unable to pronounce as to the particular quality of the article produced, but I am given to understand that cigarettes manufactured from my noble friend's tobacco are actually procurable within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster. Therefore something has been achieved by the generosity of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
My noble friend suggested another means of doing something for this purpose. I mean the use of the Development Act which was passed by Parliament last year. I have here the first section of the Development Act. What does it say? It runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The Treasury may make advances to a Government Department or through a Government Department to a public authority or to an association of persons&#x2014;</quote>
I call attention to those words&#x2014;
<quote>"for the purpose of aiding and developing agricultural and rural industries by promoting scientific research, instruction and experiments in the science, methods and practice of agriculture, and by the adoption of any other means which appear calculated to develop agriculture and rural industries."</quote>
Those words seem to me to cover the case of my noble friend behind me; and I do hope that, not content with mere platonic expressions of approval and admiration, His Majesty's Government will really look into this matter, and, whenever they have leisure to appoint these Commissioners, consider whether that agency cannot be used in order to do something to bring about the object which my noble friend has so close at heart. He has at any rate laid his case with great clearness before your Lordships, and I think he must not be altogether dissatisfied with the amount of concurrence which he has elicited from both sides of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01158"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join with the noble Marquess opposite in the hope that the noble Earl is not dissatisfied with the reception of this matter at your Lordships' hands. The noble Marquess truly said that
<col>552</col>
it is one of great national importance. I think we shall all agree with that, and my only regret is that in a House of 600 members who own, as we are sometimes told, one-fifth, and at other times the proportion is given as one-third, of the land of the country, there should only be at the present moment thirty-three Peers to discuss so important a subject. The noble Earl said, at the commencement of his remarks, that he was going to make a non-Party speech, and I suppose according to his own ideas he succeeded in doing so. Nevertheless he laid hold of a somewhat jocose remark of my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer with regard to taxing land out of existence. I happen to be a member of the same Cabinet. Every sixpence I have is invested in land, and if I or my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack had the faintest idea that such a thing was seriously meant I do not think that he or I would long remain a member of the Cabinet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01159"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to withdraw what he said?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01160"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl also took me to task for not sending apostles round the country on a crusade in favour of sugar beet. But we have done that. We have subsidised agricultural colleges, which grow beet themselves to some extent, and they have spread the knowledge of its culture among the farmers. Therefore I cannot accept the charge of stupidity and indifference with which the noble Earl was good enough to brand His Majesty's Government in his non-Party speech. I will only say, in passing, that when the noble Earl does make a Party speech I hope I may be somewhere in the neighbourhood and that I may be privileged to hear him. We are all agreed that sugar beet can be grown successfully in this country. That was shown years and years ago. I need not delay the House on that point, except to observe that the problem under discussion is rather more a commercial than an agricultural one.<lb/>
No beet sugar is at present made in England, and a specific charge will, of course, be made as soon as it is manufactured in this country. What noble Lords really want is a bounty of 1<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. per cwt. on English-grown sugar, and that the Government absolutely and entirely refuse to give. My noble friend behind me put
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0302"/>
<col>553</col>
to the noble Marquess the perfectly pertinent question, What did he think would happen when a Tariff Reform Government came into power? But the noble Marquess, with his usual adroitness, gave no answer; he contented himself with the historic formula, "Wait and see." Is there any reason why the refusal of a bounty would prevent the development of this industry? There are several factories at present in Holland which are going strong, although the tax on imported sugar is exactly the same as the tax on native-grown sugar. No doubt those factories were started originally with a bounty, but at that time nobody believed that sugar beet growing could be made to pay. The noble Earl said that foreigners are asking English farmers to grow a beet supply, and that there is talk of putting up a foreign factory in England. If they can do that without any bonus, surely it is time for Englishmen to wake up and do the same. The noble Marquess spoke of the necessity of dry nursing infant industries. As a family man I do not think that dry-nursing is the best way of bringing up an infant. However, let that pass. The sole object of noble Lords opposite seems to be, since Tariff Reform has been started, to bring forward and foster infant or decrepit industries which are unable to stand upright or to run alone. Here is a case in point. We were told a short time ago that &#x00A3;400,000 was all that was wanted. We were rather staggered at the figure; but we are now informed that the amount is &#x00A3;750,000 a year&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01161"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: I was, as I have already explained, drawing a supposititious case. I said that if a hundred factories were started that might possibly be the loss of Revenue, but it would be many years before a hundred factories could be started.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01162"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Take the question of small holdings, to which the noble Marquess referred. In two years we have a hundred square miles of land, and there is hardly any charge on the rates or hardly any expense on the Imperial Exchequer. Where is all this dry nursing of infant industries going to stop? I saw it suggested recently that assistance should be given in the growing of daffodils, and it was stated as a monstrous thing that daffodils should be allowed to come in from foreign countries and should not be grown here. The position of Ireland as regards tobacco growing is
<col>554</col>
absolutely different from the position of beet-growing in England. In the eighteenth century the British Parliament forbade the cultivation of tobacco in Ireland altogether at a time when it was a flourishing industry, and it is to compensate the Irish for that somewhat high-handed injury that the Government have agreed to pay &#x00A3;6,000 a year for five years in order to help to re-establish a trade that was destroyed by the action of this country.<lb/>
Noble Lords on both sides of the House wish to stop unemployment. The difference between us is one of policy. The policy of noble Lords opposite is to assist industries by means of protective duties. The policy of the Government is based on the belief that any manipulation of duties for the purpose of starting or bolstering up an industry is wasteful and makes for inefficiency. But that does not mean that the Government are going to sit still. There is no want of enterprise or initiative on our side. We have embodied our views as to the means by which agriculture and other industries can be benefited in the Development Act of last year, as to the merits of which I do not think any difference of opinion can exist. The Government will have nothing to do with meeting the views of noble Lords opposite on fiscal matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01163"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: Do I understand the noble Earl to say that the privileges to the tobacco growers in Ireland were granted as some return for the fact that for years tobacco growing was forbidden there?</membercontribution></p>

<title>SOMALILAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01185"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call attention to the evacuation of the Somaliland Protectorate by His Majesty's Government; to ask for information from the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and to move for Papers. I feel that I need offer no apology for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. The abandonment&#x2014;for that is what it amounts to&#x2014;of a strip of territory 300 to 400 miles in length and some 200 miles in width, with a population of between 200,000 and 300,000 people, with some of whom we have been in treaty relations for eighty years and over the majority of whom we have exercised a definite protectorate for more than a quarter of a century, is a very serious matter. It is serious, at any rate, for the inhabitants of the country itself, it is serious in its effects upon the policy and prestige of His Majesty's Government, and it may conceivably in its consequences be serious in relation to contiguous parts of our Empire in Africa. Your Lordships will, I think, agree that an incident like this ought not to pass without full discussion in one or other House of Parliament, and without ample vindication by the responsible Minister of the steps that have led his Government to arrive at this momentous decision.<lb/>
There have been already in the present session of Parliament two necessarily somewhat perfunctory discussions on the subject in the House of Commons, but since then a Blue-book has appeared which has for the first time given us the opportunity of discovering what the policy of the Government in its various stages has been. So far as I can understand we are now confronted, not merely with a <i>res judicata</i>, but with a <i>res gesta</i>. The evacuation has taken place or is taking place at this moment. The British flag has been withdrawn, and the steps
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0304"/>
<col>557</col>
which have led to that are detailed in this Blue-book that I hold in my hand. I do not suppose many of your Lordships have read through this book, but I venture to say that those who have will have found it a rather painful and discreditable tale. It leaves a distinctly unpleasant taste in the mouth of those who have perused it, as it has been my duty to do, from cover to cover.<lb/>
Somaliland is a country which has entailed upon us great sacrifices. We have expended there a large number of valuable lives and much treasure. I believe that our total expenditure on Somaliland during the last twenty-five years has amounted to between &#x00A3;3,000,000 and &#x00A3;4,000,000. Now, what is the result of it all? We capitulate to the Mullah; we hand the country over to him and leave him master of the situation; we disband the force of native troops that we have laboriously, but with great success, raised in the country itself; we leave the people who are somewhat euphemistically called friendly tribes but whose attitude is now, I suspect, of rather a different description&#x2014;we leave them to the tender mercies of their enemies; and atone blow we wipe out the creditable and successful work of twenty-five years. This is a policy that may be capable of explanation, and even of good defence; and it is for that purpose that I venture to interrogate His Majesty's Government this afternoon. At any rate, it is not a state of affairs that can possibly be regarded with indifference by members of the Legislature of this country.<lb/>
I need not embark upon any lengthy excursion into ancient history. We may have been wrong when in the year 1884, under the then Government of Mr. Gladstone, we assumed the Protectorate of Somaliland; yet for my own part I think that the reasons for this action at that date were very strong, just as I think good reasons can be found for almost each successive stage in our occupation ever since. Your Lordships will remember that at that time we had just overturned the native government in Egypt which, under the rule of Ismail Pasha, had expanded itself in directions far outside the natural and legitimate boundaries of Egypt proper. Egyptian troops had planted themselves at Zeila and Berbera and other places in Somaliland. Accordingly it became our duty to take their place, and for this reason.
<col>558</col>
In the first place, we had to prevent the anarchy that must have ensued from the dissolution of the governing power; secondly, we had to protect the food supply of Aden, which is largely derived from the ports on the Somaliland coast; and, thirdly, we desired to avoid the danger of the encroachments of foreign Powers' upon the flank of our main line of communication to India. Those were the reasons which in 1884 led the Government of that day to assume the Protectorate, to occupy a long strip of territory on the coast with posts, to plant officers and garrisons in certain places in the country, to conclude certain treaties with the various tribes, and, later on, also to conclude boundary conventions with the neighbouring Powers of Italy and France and Abyssinia.<lb/>
After that date the administration passed through various phases which I can summarise almost in a sentence. Until 1898 the administration of Somaliland was under the Government of India, and it was at that time that I had the good fortune to visit the country myself in company with Sir Charles Nairne, then Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Presidency, by the Government of which the administration of the Protectorate was conducted. Those were the halcyon days of the Protectorate. The trade was considerable, the tribes were peaceful, no Mullah had arisen on the scene, and the finances of the country were in a very flourishing condition. In 1898, for reasons into which I need not now enter, the administration was transferred to the Foreign Office, and in 1905 to the Office over which the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies presides. It was about the year 1899, just after the Foreign Office had taken over the administration, that the Mullah began to give trouble. This Mullah, who seems to me to be less mad than anybody to whom the attribute has ever been assigned, was originally a hanger-on in the bazaars of Berbera. I am not sure that he was not even a teacher in a native school. The succeeding ten years have, as everybody knows, been years of incessant irritation and conflict between us and him. Three or four expeditions have had to be conducted in the country, with varying success; and finally these military operations culminated, as we then thought, in a crushing defeat which was inflicted upon the Mullah by General Egerton, a capable
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0305"/>
<col>559</col>
officer whom I remember we sent from India and who did inflict a very crushing defeat upon the Mullah at Jidballi in the month of January, 1904. The Mullah then retired into Italian territory, and I suppose the Government of that day, as all Governments are apt to do, hugged to their breast the fond illusion that they had got rid of him for ever.<lb/>
That brings us to the time when the present Government assumed office&#x2014;namely, 1905. For the first year or two nothing particular seems to have occurred; but we gather from the Blue-book that it was about the middle of 1908 that the Mullah who had all the while been utilising his period of retirement in Italian territory to recuperate his position, to spread his propaganda, and to undermine the loyalty of the native tribes, once again threw off the mask and exchanged an attitude of dubious hostility to His Majesty's Government for one of open defiance. He then called upon the British authorities to withdraw their posts from the interior, and he had the audacity to forbid us to take steps against the unruly tribes in our own sphere of influence. It is a rather difficult thing to condense in a speech the contents of a prolonged correspondence in a Blue-book extending over ninety pages of print, but I hope I shall do no substantial injustice to the case of His Majesty's Government if I state that the stages by which we have arrived at the present conclusion appear to me to have been the following.<lb/>
The views of His Majesty's Government are first stated in a despatch dated November 30, 1908, which is printed on page 25 of the Blue-book. At this point their attitude was still of a somewhat tentative and cautious character. They were not prepared for a great expedition against the Mullah, and there, if I may say so, I think they were quite right. They were prepared to hold the Berbera-Burao line and to order military reinforcements from Africa, but they hinted at the ultimate evacuation of Burao and threw out the suggestion that it might be possible to subsidise the Mullah much in the same way as we subsidise refractory tribes and headmen on the North-West frontier of India. The next occasion on which their policy is stated is a few months later, in a telegram dated March 12, 1909, and appearing on page 41 of the Blue-book. Here they have made
<col>560</col>
a substantial and notable advance, or perhaps I ought rather to call it retirement, in their attitude. They now say in this telegram that the cost of the transport of the troops whom they had sent was so great that a reconsideration of their policy is forced upon them. They openly hint at a policy of complete withdrawal, they revive the idea of subsidising the Mullah, and they ask the very pertinent question whether it may be possible to arm the friendly tribes, who might otherwise be left to look after themselves. In reply to these indications of their policy the attitude and advice of the local Commissioner are, from the Blue-book, quite clear. Let me say that Captain Cordeaux, the officer in question, is a gentleman whom I have never met, with whom I have had no communications, but who, in the opinion of all those who know Somaliland, is not only the officer best acquainted with the conditions of that country, in which he has served, I believe, for ten years, but he is an officer well known for his sobriety of judgment as well as his loyalty to the Government which he has served.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01187"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Captain Cordeaux's views, condensed as I shall endeavour to condense them from a great number of telegrams and despatches, were apparently as follow. In the first place, he was under no illusion as to the policy of the Mullah. Twice over&#x2014;on pages 13 and 31 of the Blue-book&#x2014;he states that the Mullah had never abandoned the idea of eventually becoming the master of Somaliland. That is, he clearly indicated to His Majesty's Government the scope of the Mullah's ambitions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01188"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: What was the date of that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01189"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am referring to Captain Cordeaux's memorandum dated October 7, 1908, and appearing on pages 12, 13, and 14 of the Blue-book, and to his despatch dated January, 1909, and appearing on page 31. For these reasons the Commissioner did not believe in the professions of friendship that sometimes came from the Mullah. Neither did he believe, for very good reasons, into which I need not enter now, in the policy of subsidising that person.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0306"/>
<col>561</col>
He pointed out, however&#x2014;and this is very significant&#x2014;that the Mullah had not gained and was not gaining strength, and that, if firmly resisted, he believed that his power would recede. Secondly, Captain Cordeaux laid great stress&#x2014;and this fact, too, is significant in view of what has occurred since&#x2014;upon the feebleness and lack of cohesion amongst the so-called friendly tribes, thereby giving a sort of warning to His Majesty's Government of the danger of expecting them to stand up alone. Thirdly, he outlined, I think quite clearly, what he described as a middle course, which he advocated and which was this&#x2014;a continued military occupation of the interior and particularly of the Berbera-Burao line, with a view of fulfilling our obligations to the tribes, of reassuring them, and of checking the possible advance of the Mullah. Above all&#x2014;and it is to this that I respectfully invite the attention of your Lordships&#x2014;he most strenuously opposed the policy of evacuation. On three occasions&#x2014;at pages 42, 43 and 52 of the Blue-book&#x2014;those views are repeated.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be allowed to read to your Lordships the two last pronouncements because they are very significant. In the despatch appearing on page 43, dated March 8, 1909, Captain Cordeaux says&#x2014;
<quote>"In fact, I do not think that an evacuation would be possible at any time or under any circumstances until the Mullah's power has been finally broken either by the present measures, or by a successful expedition."</quote>
And on page 52, at the end of his telegram dated April 3, 1909, he says&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not hesitate to say withdrawal in face of an actively hostile Mullah would be disastrous not only to our tribes but also to our prestige throughout North-East Africa."</quote>
From these quotations, which I might easily supplement, the attitude of the Commissioner, I think, stands out quite clearly. He most loyally carries out the instructions which he receives from His Majesty's Government, but he cannot bring himself to recommend a policy which he regards as disastrous to the best interests of the Protectorate. He states the counter policy which he himself advocates, and he repeatedly pleads most urgently against evacuation. It must have been evident from this that His Majesty's Government would not find a very willing, although a perfectly loyal, executant of their policy in the Commissioner.<lb/>
<col>562</col>
At this point occurs a hiatus in the Blue-book which I believe I am in a position to fill. I believe that at this stage His Majesty's Government turned to the Resident at Aden and sought his advice. He is an officer who served under me in India. Again in this case I have had no communication whatever from him, either directly or indirectly. My information comes from an entirely independent quarter at a great distance. As I have said, I believe that at this stage His Majesty's Government turned to the Resident at Aden and asked him whether he could assist them in the policy of evacuation on which they had apparently resolved. I am told that General De Brath was himself as strongly opposed to this policy as was the Commissioner on the spot. However that may be, the Government then had to look elsewhere, and accordingly we find, from the Blue-book, that they sent out two very distinguished officers, Sir Reginald Wingate (the Governor-General of the Soudan) and Sir Rudolph Slatin, who, of course, have had great experience of a somewhat analogous situation in the Soudan, and they asked them for their advice. The full instructions to these officers, dated April 15, 1909, are printed on pages 52 to 55 of the Blue-book, and from them it is evident that the full policy of evacuation had been decided upon by the Government, or rather, of what they somewhat euphemistically describe as "coastal concentration," which apparently means evacuating the country but leaving some faint vestiges of your authority in some few selected places along the coast.<lb/>
The only passage in these instructions to which I would ask your Lordships' leave to refer is the concluding sentence, because again it is very significant in view of what has happened. The Government&#x2014;page 54 of the Blue-book&#x2014;say to Sir Reginald Wingate&#x2014;
<quote>"Should the Mullah increase his prestige, either by our partial or complete withdrawal, by our failure to deal effectually with him, or by some success on his part, it will be urged that the results may be disastrous for British influence outside Somaliland itself. On the Juba River, the frontier of the East Africa Protectorate, there are powerful and turbulent Somali tribes, and if once they were set in motion by the Mullah the consequences might be most serious for the East Africa Protectorate, while our prestige in the other countries in North-East Africa, such as the Soudan and Uganda, might be injuriously affected. In any recommendations which you may make, you will no doubt bear this aspect of the question in mind."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0307"/>
<col>563</col>
And then the Secretary of State concludes by saying that he will anxiously await the recommendations of these officers. My Lords, we are in exactly the same position. We are anxiously awaiting them at this moment. As to what those recommendations were not a single member of your Lordships' House, from the Blue-book, has the slightest means of ascertaining. These two officers went out to Berbera. They spent, I believe, six weeks in the country, in the course of which they made a short journey into the interior. They sent envoys to the Mullah, and received an envoy in return from him. On June 15 the Secretary of State telegraphs that he is still awaiting the report of Sir Reginald Wingate with interest, as we are at this moment; and in July that officer came back to London, and apparently his report must have been in the hands of the Secretary of State shortly afterwards. Are we not entitled to ask, so much stress being laid upon the authority of these officers, the anxiety of the Secretary of State to receive their report being more than once repeated, the action of His Majesty's Government having presumably been affected by the advice received by them&#x2014;are we not entitled to ask, Where is this report? Of what character was it? Why has it not been laid before Parliament? If the whole of the report cannot be given may not extracts from it be placed before us? If that is impossible, is the Secretary of State in a position to tell us this afternoon what was its general character and purport? From the Blue-book the only hint that we get as to what its character may have been is in a telegram of September 2, on page 61&#x2014;a telegram from the Government to the Commissioner of a very cautious description. They say that it is not practicable at that time to outline their policy in full; they admit that the Mullah has been much discredited; they still cling to the idea that the "friendlies" can be encouraged to defend themselves; and they suggest a gradual and cautious reduction of the force in Somaliland.<lb/>
Then occurs another gap of two months&#x2014;from September till November of last year; and on the twelfth of November&#x2014;page 71&#x2014;there is a telegram in which the full policy of the Government is finally disclosed. We now learn that the East African reinforcements are to be withdrawn; that the local battalion&#x2014;the local battalion, I may
<col>564</col>
mention, Was of local troops, partly Somali, which had been organised. I and trained to a relatively high point of efficiency for many years in the country&#x2014;is to be disbanded; that coastal concentration is to be adopted as the policy; and that our administration is to be limited to two or three important towns on the coast which are only to be occupied by small garrisons in the future. At this stage His Majesty's Government were wise enough to realise that the execution of such a policy as this would be very distasteful if not impossible to the Commissioner, and accordingly the Secretary of State very generously offers him promotion in another sphere of activity. Again the noble Earl adds that he is "anxiously awaiting his reply." So, my Lords, are we. I should very much like to see what we have not been permitted to see&#x2014;namely, what was the reply of the Commissioner to that telegram. A little later there is a telegram dated December 18&#x2014;page 74 of the Blue-book&#x2014;in which the important condition is added that the evacuation is not to be carried out unless and until the friendly tribes can reasonably be said to be in a position to hold their own against the Mullah, or to be free from the risk of serious attack by him.<lb/>
Finally, in January of this year General Manning, who, of course, has a unique experience of the country because he has fought several campaigns there, was sent to Berbera to carry out the policy of evacuation. The instructions to him, which are printed in the Blue-book on page 75 and dated January, 1910, contain a full <i>r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;</i> of the policy of the Government, the only addition to what I have previously said being that it is now recognised that some time may elapse before evacuation can take place. The first telegram from General Manning is received on February 12 of the present year. It is on page 84 of the Blue-book, and I call attention to this because it is really a very remarkable document. General Manning tells us, as the result of his first inquiries on the spot, that he found the tribes broken up into several parties&#x2014;that is to say, no longer a powerful and coherent force. The Mullah, he says, is not the man he was in 1903 and 1904, and his policy does not contemplate invasion of our Protectorate. Well, my Lords, does it not occur to you that these were the precise local conditions which we had been working and waiting for for years; that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0308"/>
<col>565</col>
they are the very conditions which justified, not the policy upon which His Majesty's Government were so anxious to embark, but a reconsideration of that policy in the direction of the views put before them by their advisers on the spot? But so far from these views having that effect, they only led His Majesty's Government to the conclusion that the evacuation could be carried out with even greater speed than had previously been contemplated. Accordingly a day was fixed last month for the retirement to the coast, and, for all we know now, the movement may be at an end and all evidences of our occupation of the interior may have ceased to exist. There the Blue-book ends, and for subsequent information we have to turn to the columns of the daily Press.<lb/>
In our newspapers the day before yesterday there appeared a telegram from Aden to the effect that the Mullah had slaughtered 800 friendly natives, had captured their stock, and that the friendlies were fleeing towards the coast. I have seen no denial of that in the newspapers since. On the contrary, it was confirmed, at any rate in the newspapers that I saw, yesterday morning and this morning. If that be true&#x2014;and no one would be better pleased than myself to know that it is not&#x2014;if that be true, it is the melancholy first fruits of your policy of coastal concentration and evacuation of the interior. I ask your Lordships, what then are the conclusions to which the rather hurried and imperfect survey of the negotiations which is all that I have been able to place before you lead us? They are, I think, these. In the first; place, the policy of evacuation&#x2014;whether it be right or wrong I cannot offer an opinion without further information&#x2014;is not, so far as the Blue-book goes, supported by a single expert officer familiar with the country. Secondly, it is openly disapproved of by the Commissioner and by our Resident at Aden, General De Brath. Thirdly, we do not know at present what are the views of the distinguished officers who were sent out from the Soudan to advise His Majesty's Government; and, fourthly, we do not even know what are the views of that considerable authority, General Manning.<lb/>
I think the narrative leaves upon us the impression that the evacuation has been carried out at the precise moment
<col>566</col>
when it was least required. The Mullah, as described by everybody, is a receding, not an advancing force, and apparently forces of a disintegrating character are at work among his followers which might at least have been left alone to pursue their natural course. Then, again, the narrative leaves upon me at any rate the impression that the evacuation has been conducted with quite unnecessary speed&#x2014;I had almost said with indecent precipitation; and the very considerations of delay and caution which His Majesty's Government wisely insisted upon in some of the passages I have read appear to have been lost sight of in what must have been almost a stampede to the coast. I am afraid that the only steps which have been taken by the Government to meet the perils of this situation have been to put arms into the hands of some of the friendly tribes both on the East and the West, and to remove the prohibition that has hitherto existed upon their procuring arms from the neighbouring French port of Jibuti. That is a very risky policy, because for years we have been endeavouring to prevent this contraband traffic in arms from this French port. Now apparently we are encouraging our own tribes to go and do that which for years we have successfully implored the French Government to prohibit and have prevented our own protected tribes from doing. I believe you have handed out a large number of rifles both to the Eastern and Western tribes. What is the good of handing rifles to men who have never had a rifle in their hands in their lives? It would not be very successful in our own country; it is deplorable in a country like Somaliland. What will happen? The whole of these arms you have given to your Eastern tribes on the border where the Mullah now is will go&#x2014;I expect the greater portion of them have already gone&#x2014;into the possession of the Mullah; those on the western side will pass into the hands of the Ogaden and other tribes on the Abyssinian frontier. Thus what will almost assuredly happen will be that every one of these 1,000 or 2,000 rifles, or whatever the number may be, that you have distributed will at a day perhaps not very far distant be turned against ourselves.<lb/>
I would now ask your Lordships to survey for a moment what will be the probable consequence of evacuation. In the first place I take the consequences upon the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0309"/>
<col>567</col>
spot. At the very moment when this Mullah was apparently discredited, when there had arrived this message from Mecca&#x2014;this authoritative message from Mecca&#x2014;saying that he was, from the religious standpoint, an impostor and a sham, and when his forces are falling away from him, you give him this tremendous impetus. What does he do? He turns against the Dolbahanta. The Dolbahanta will immediately realise that they have to do with a strong man. They will all be his men in a year's time and probably less, and with his forces thus augmented he will hurl himself against the tribes on the Western side whom we have successfully protected all these years and who will no longer be able to resist him. In other words, you give the Mullah an opportunity of sweeping the Protectorate from end to end.<lb/>
I do think that we are bound to consider the feelings and attitude of these friendly tribes themselves. I was looking up just now the terms of the Treaties of Protection which we concluded with these tribes in the year 1884. I cannot find them at the moment, but it comes to this, that in return for the assurances that they gave us that they would not enter into treaty relations with or cede their territory to foreign Powers, we solemnly guaranteed to them the gracious protection and favour of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress. Those were the words of the treaty. What will these tribes say to us? What are they saying at this moment to our officers? They are saying, "You told us that you would give us the gracious favour and protection of your illustrious Sovereign. Upon that we have relied for twenty-five years. You would not allow us arms; you have turned us from men into women"&#x2014;that is the phraseology that they employ in their own country&#x2014;"and now you desert us and leave us to be looted by our hereditary foes. It was formerly a source of pride to us to be British subjects, but what was then a pride has now become a stigma and a reproach." I am not talking in a rhetorical vein. I am stating to you exactly the words which are now being used by the tribes to the British officers in Somaliland. What is the upshot of it all? You have by this act, be it justifiable or not, blackened the name of Great Britain in that country; you have taken away from these tribes the possibility of relying upon your pledged word in the future.<lb/>
<col>568</col>
Then the Secretary of State tells us in the Blue-book that the Government are going to withdraw our entire administration to the coast. I venture to ask the noble Earl, What does that mean? Have the Government any clear idea as to what they are driving at in this matter? The position up to date has been this. We have had six officers stationed in the interior of Somaliland&#x2014;at Burao, Odweina, Ber, Hargeisa, and Sheikh&#x2014;each with a small body of police. One might infer from the discussion in the House of Commons that these were isolated posts, so to speak, in the desert. They are nothing of the sort. They are settlements to which under our Protectorate the natives have been encouraged to go in large numbers; they have built houses there, and have carried on a prosperous trade. Burao, one of these places, which barely appears on the map, is a bigger place than Berbera, and Hargeisa also is a place of considerable size. In a moment all these places are to be destroyed. The flag is taken down, and the work of twenty-five years is thrown away. You tell us that you are going to concentrate at a few places on the coast. I wonder if I might ask the Secretary of State to explain what he means. What are the places he is going to concentrate at?<lb/>
There is talk in the Blue-book about keeping the flag flying at Berbera, Zeila, and Bulhar, but there seems to be some inclination to evacuate Zeila and Bulhar and to maintain our position at Berbera alone. Perhaps the noble Earl will be able to tell us what are the intentions of His Majesty's Government in the matter. But whether you retain your officers at one place or two or three, what are they going to do? You talk in the Blue-book about fortifying the position. Does that mean that British officers with or without a number of troops, are to sit down on the coast at Berbera and twiddle their thumbs and wait there while the Mullah overruns the whole country or while the friendly tribes are eaten up, and do nothing? It seems to me that all the arguments for the evacuation of the interior apply equally to the evacuation of the coast, and that when you have cleared out from the places where alone you can do good to your protected tribes, it is useless to keep officers on the sea shore. There may be some point in the proceeding which I have not apprehended. Anyhow, I venture to ask for information on the point.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0310"/>
<col>569</col>
My own fear is that there is not likely to be any more finality about this policy of evacuation than there has been about the various policies which have preceded it. Experience teaches us that evacuation in those parts of the world is often of a rather precarious and delusive character. It is ignominious at the time and not effective in the future. We have been trying evacuation for the last hundred years in place after place in Asia and Africa. We have tried it in the Soudan, in the Transvaal, in Afghanistan, in Chitral, and in Tibet. In each instance a strong case could be made out. Pate has taken us back to some of these places, and he would be a bold man who would say it would never take us back to the remainder; and he would be a bold man too who would say that by this act of evacuation we have said the last to Somaliland.<lb/>
But is not there a wider issue involved&#x2014;namely, the effect it will have on your policy in the other portions of the British Empire? These considerations are not irrevelant, because they were present to the mind of His Majesty's Government themselves. That is clear from the passage which I read out a little earlier from the instructions to Sir Reginald Wingate. They ask him to advise what the effect might be in the Soudan, in Uganda, and elsewhere. What the reply to that request was we have not been told. I should like to learn from His Majesty's Government whether they have received any reassuring information on this point, and I should also like to be certain that our very good friends the Italians in their neighbouring sphere of influence are not disconcerted and will not be injured by that which we have done. You must remember that news of this sort runs with the rapidity of a prairie fire throughout the country. News will get about that we have broken out pledges, that the friendly tribes have been deserted and slaughtered, and the very considerations of expediency and expense which appeal so strongly and not unreasonably to us here are perfect gibberish to them. They do not look upon retreat as a symbol of far-sighted policy, but as a mark of military discomfiture and defeat. I venture to say that throughout East Africa there will be but one opinion&#x2014;namely, that the Mullah has won and that we have lost. In the short discussion that took place in the House of Commons the other day, in replying to a charge
<col>570</col>
which had been made by an hon. member of that House, Mr. Baird, who speaks from an intimate knowledge of Somaliland&#x2014;a charge to the effect that we had left the friendlies to their fate&#x2014;the Under-Secretary for the Colonies indulged in a rather swelling period, no doubt well suited to a peroration, about maintaining the honour and integrity of the Empire. To cat out 68,000 square miles and 300,000 people from the British Empire may be, from our point of view, a very small sacrifice. It may not matter to us a snap of the fingers. But, my Lords, it may be of importance, it may be vital, it may be the whole of their existence, to the people whom you thus excise. Then as regards the honour of the Empire, I am not certain that we are the best judges of the matter. I should like to hear the views entertained by the elders and the chiefs of the tribes themselves.<lb/>
I do not wish to pursue this matter further. My speech has been made with a view really of asking for information from His Majesty's Government. I may, perhaps, have done them an injustice in some of the suspicions in which I have indulged. If that be so, it arises from the gaps in the Blue-book, for which they and not I am responsible. Until we have heard what their case is I am loth to condemn their policy outright, but on the face of it it looks as though this policy had been carried out against the advice of their expert authorities, and as if it had been executed with extreme and indefensible precipitation; and I think it is very difficult indeed to resist the conclusion that our friendly tribes have been left in the lurch, that it is not we but they who will have to pay the price, and it may be a further consequence that a not inconsiderable blow will have been inflicted upon the prestige of our Empire in regions far outside the borders of Somaliland itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01190"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I had the honour of administering the affairs of the Somaliland coast for some five years, and being, as far as I can see, the last Governor of Bombay present to-day who had that responsibility, perhaps I may offer a few remarks, not so much following upon what the noble Lord has said or with any idea of putting forward a suggestion as to the best thing to be done now, but as illustrating the inadvisability of under-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0311"/>
<col>571</col>
taking responsibilities in a country like this far beyond where our own traders wish our responsibilities to go. I take it that the theory is not a very unsound one that the Flag has followed trade rather than trade has followed the Flag in the case of the British Empire. In the case of the Somaliland coast, how did we get there? The Egyptian garrison had to be withdrawn and we undertook to do that for them, and to maintain the three ports mentioned by the noble Lord&#x2014;Zeila, Bulhar, and Berbera. When I visited them on first going out I found the British officer at Bulhar living under the same roof as his horse. That was the kind of accommodation provided for the British officer on the coast; and as far as I remember the whole force that was maintained on the coast during the time that I had the administration was half a battalion of native infantry. And what was our object? Simply to provide beef for the garrison at Aden. The trade was infinitesimal, and there was no object in extending our responsibilities.<lb/>
There is, a few miles inland, a natural feature, which I insisted should be observed as the natural limit of our responsibilities. It is a waterless tract, and if a swashbuckler happened to get beyond that natural frontier and hauled up the British flag, I took care that it was hauled down. I saw no reason why the money of India or of England should be expended on military operations in that country, and as long as I had anything to do with it there were no military operations. I do not think we lost one scrap of trade, the responsibilities of the Government were of a limited character, and jurisdiction did not run beyond the ports. If a caravan came down and a malefactor was handed over to the British officer at the port, he reported to Aden and subsequently to Bombay, and asked what he was to do with him. The wisdom of the Government of India eventually decided&#x2014;not the Government of Bombay; we would not take the responsibility&#x2014;what was to be done with that malefactor. Sometimes he subsequently found himself in Aden gaol and sometimes on the Andaman Island. How he got there, by what process of law, I do not know, but he did get there and justice was done. But the great thing was to refrain from extending our responsibilities in the country. Since then very heavy responsibilities have been
<col>572</col>
pushed far into the country over tribes that did not at that time touch upon the trade of the ports, and I cannot help thinking that the Government have been launched into heavy responsibilities in connection with treaties which were quite unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>

That is the impression I have formed, and I mention it now as an illustration of the heavy responsibilities which this country is forced into. The trade of the country is infinitesimal, and I do not think it is justifiable for a country with the burdens of Empire that this country has to have undertaken these responsibilities&#x2014;responsibilities which are usually thrown upon us by one of the two Departments not generally regarded as spending Departments, namely, either by the Colonial Office or the Foreign Office. Subsequently large numbers of men have to be employed for the purpose of protecting the natives who grow up and also the trade that grows up in these places, and the blame is cast upon the War Office. I have only ventured to speak because of my personal experience on the coast and my firm belief that with a cautious policy it would have been possible to avoid both the heavy expenditure of the last few years and the far more serious loss of life.</membercontribution></p>

I might, however, complain, I think, of the inaccuracy of the

He speaks of the evacuation of the Somaliland Protectorate, and in the course of his speech he seemed to imply that a country was evacuated even though you retained possession of several towns on the coast.

But the point is not one of supreme importance. The noble Lord complained that this was not merely a <i>res judicata</i> but a <i>res gesta</i> before an opportunity was given to the House to discuss it. That was an inevitable concomitant of the circumstances. The time when the evacuation of the interior could safely be made was necessarily left to the judgment of those on the spot, and to have made it a subject of discussion in Parliament before it was clear when the actual steps of withdrawal from these advanced posts could be made would, as I think the House will see, have very possibly involved considerable danger. It was due to the tribes concerned that the first news that they should get of our withdrawal from the advanced posts should be made to them by those on the spot whom they knew and trusted, and that they should not hear it from the extremely inaccurate sources of information from which it might otherwise have reached them.<lb/>
The noble Lord, in his masterly way, went through a rapid sketch of the earlier history of Somaliland, and I am relieved therefore from following him in that survey; but he did not state that this particular policy of concentration of force on the coast was the definite policy of the Government of that day after the operations which were terminated by the victory of
<col>574</col>
General Egerton at Jidballi. I do not think I shall be contradicted by noble Lords opposite who know the circumstances when I say that it was the intention of the Government of the time to concentrate precisely in the manner in which we are concentrating at this moment. The noble Lord spoke of his speech as a series of interrogations. I think it contained a good deal besides interrogation. It contained a good deal of insinuation, and it contained no small measure of denunciation. The noble Lord spoke somewhat slightingly, and I am bound to say somewhat strangely for him, of the swelling periods used by my right hon. friend the Under-Secretary for the Colonies. But he himself indulged in the course of his speech in no small amount of rhetoric, and I think he would have done better to pitch his speech in a somewhat lower key and if he had waited to denounce us for blackening the name of England until he had had an opportunity of considering a little further what the facts of the case really are. In considering this whole question you have to look at what the character of Somaliland really is. It is unique within the Empire, so far as I know. It is certainly, and happily, unique as regards those parts of the Empire which it is my duty to supervise. The noble Lord who spoke last, Lord Harris, spoke of the Colonial Office as being one of the Offices which was apt to lead the country into ill-considered commitments. I can assure him I have never been able to regard Somaliland in any sense as a Colony, or, indeed, as a proper subject for the administration of the Colonial Office.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01201"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The problems of Somaliland, since I have been at the Colonial Office at any rate, have been of a purely military character, and it is altogether impossible to compare that country, for instance, either with the older African Colonies or with the five great newly-established Protectorates and Colonies where we have to deal with problems of transport, agriculture, education, improvement, and civilisation generally. Somaliland is no country such as those. It is a stony desert interspersed with wells, round which during the dry season a purely pastoral people, the descendants of Ishmael and Esau, I do not say by direct heredity but so far as their habits are concerned,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0313"/>
<col>575</col>
cluster; while in the rainy season they wander with their flocks and herds to the various pools formed by the rains, for the purposes of pasture. There is no settled civilisation of any kind, and when the noble Lord speaks of such places as Burao as though they were small imitations, say, of Bombay, he is unintentionally conveying to the minds of your Lordships an impression very far removed from the truth.<lb/>
As your Lordships know, from 1901 to January, 1904, when General Egerton won his victory, we were in continual combat with the Mullah Muhammed Abdullah, and the cost of fighting him at that time amounted to between &#x00A3;2,000,000 and &#x00A3;3,000,000. I entirely agree with the noble Lord opposite that the epithet "mad" is the last which ought to be applied to that remarkable man. If he were in this country he would certainly not be debarred from being a member of your Lordships' House&#x2014;at any rate on the ground of insanity. But it is also true that the Mullah of to-day is not at all the Mullah of the years 1901&#x2013;1904. The noble Lord mentioned but did not dwell upon the remarkable fact of the Mullah's denunciation by the head of his particular Mahomedan sect at Mecca. The effect of that denunciation was two-fold. It undoubtedly affected the minds of his own followers; it diminished his influence with them, and caused a great many to desert. But its effect was more important and infinitely more far-reaching upon the minds of those who are spoken of as friendly tribes; and for this reason. Up to that time the Mullah had been regarded as possessed of something of a divine mission, and even those who were most harassed by him and were prepared to fight against him were disturbed by the reflection that in doing so they might, to use a phrase from the Bible, haply be found fighting against God. Now it is not so. Such prestige as the Mullah continues to possess is the prestige merely of a successful free booter. He has with him a force which is formidable because it is, perhaps, more experienced in raiding and more reckless than other Somalis.<lb/>
I should like to remove at once one impression which your Lordships might have gained from an observation of the noble Lord. I am sure he did not intend to impart prejudice into the discussion, but it
<col>576</col>
is the kind of observation which may prove to be very misleading. He spoke of these wretched Dolbahanta who are attacked and massacred by the Mullah. The Dolbahanta are much the same people as his own tribes, just as good fighters and as ready to raid him as he is ready to raid them; and when absurd telegrams such as that which the noble Lord quoted about 800 friendly natives being slaughtered are read out as though they conveyed the real facts of the case it is extremely important to correct such a statement at once. Anybody reading that telegram would imagine that the Mullah's dervishes had raided some tribe and had slaughtered in cold blood 800 unarmed people without resistance. That, I think, is the inference which would be drawn from the telegram, and it was the inference which the noble Lord opposite tried to push home to the utmost. What really happened was that an armed combination of tribes had an engagement with the raiding party of dervishes&#x2014;there is no evidence that the Mullah was there&#x2014;in which, according to our information, a large number on both sides were killed, and it is evident that the friendly tribes got the worst of it because they had to retreat. That is what is called "fleeing towards the coast." It only shows how necessary it is to be cautious in believing such statements as those which the noble Lord quoted.<lb/>
The noble Lord made one observation which somewhat surprised me. He said that he approved of the action of the Government in not sending an expedition to defeat the Mullah. Later on the noble Lord, as the great apostle of the forward policy in all parts of the world, stated his faith that withdrawals of any kind might have to be and would have to be paid for in the long run. But in this particular case he seemed to think that His Majesty's Government were right in not undertaking a fresh expedition against the Mullah when he became active at the beginning of last year. When the Mullah became active last year we initiated a policy which from its very nature could not be a permanent policy. He became more active and made some formidable raids. We therefore collected a number of troops, if I remember aright 1,200 was the number in all, from the different Protectorates&#x2014;from East Africa, from Uganda, and Nyasaland&#x2014;and sent them to reinforce the Somaliland Protectorate forces and to act as a backing for the tribes. That policy clearly could not be a permanent
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0314"/>
<col>577</col>
one, because it was evident that those troops could not be indefinitely spared from their own Protectorates; and I quite admit that I was glad when it was found possible, by the despatch of Indian troops for the purpose of carrying out the withdrawal from the interior, to send our own Colonial troops back to their respective Protectorates.<lb/>
And it could not be a permanent policy for other reasons. What happens when a raid takes place is this. The pastoral tribes are out in front of the regular positions with their flocks and herds. They wander far afield. They are apt to take a fatalist view, to go wherever pasture is likely to be, and to chance the possibility of their being raided from one side or the other; because it must not be supposed that all the raids that are likely to take place upon tribes in our Protectorates are necessarily inspired by the Mullah or have anything to do with him. Therefore, the only way in which those flocks and herds and those with them can be really protected against raids is by sending armed parties to guard them. I think your Lordships will see that that is a policy which as a permanent policy is altogether an impossible one to pursue. It is impossible for us, I think, to look forward to sending armed parties of British troops to guard herds of camels or of cattle to the end of time against the inter-tribal raids which always have taken place in Somaliland and I take it always will take place there, considering the character of the people. If you do not do that, if you merely concentrate your troops in advanced posts, say at Burao, with other smaller forces thrown out in front, it is almost certain that at a favourable time of the year, that is to say during the rainy season when the raiders can travel fast, raids will take place and cattle will be carried off and those with them killed before it is possible to overtake those making the attack. Therefore, if you pursue the policy of keeping a considerable force on the edge of these comparatively fertile&#x2014;though fertile is, I think, a Avoid dangerous to use in connection with any part of Somaliland&#x2014;spots where flocks and herds are grazed, you will find yourselves obliged permanently to guard those grazing grounds. One might attempt an almost fanciful analogy as to what would take place, supposing cattle-driving had become a permanent custom in the West of Ireland, if it was considered necessary not merely to pursue and arrest cattle-drivers, but to
<col>578</col>
absolutely guard by two or three members of the Irish Constabulary every herd of bullocks which might be grazing on a farm in Roscommon. That being so, if it is impossible to continue the half-and-half policy of attempting to check raids in a fashion, which could not be described as generally successful, only two other policies remained. One policy which might have something to recommend it, was to send out an expedition regardless of cost, which was bound to be great, and try to corner the Mullah, and, in the classic phrase, "smash him"; the other was to take the step which we have taken in withdrawing to the coast.<lb/>
Although the noble Lord endeavoured to show that those who had been at different times responsible either directly in connection with the government of Somaliland, or indirectly, differed from our policy, I think I can safely say there is nobody who has had anything to do with Somaliland of late years who has not recognised that the ultimate alternative must lie between a costly expedition such as I have indicated and the step which we have actually taken. The noble Lord who raised this question mentioned Captain Cordeaux's views. I am glad to have the opportunity of expressing my opinion of the remarkable services rendered for a long time and in discouraging circumstances by Captain Cordeaux in Somaliland, and I have shown my sense of those services by transferring him to a post which I hope he will find in every way more agreeable and less surrounded by almost impossible problems than the one which he has just left. It was undoubtedly Captain Cordeaux's view, as the noble Lord pointed out, that on the whole, an indeterminate policy being impossible, the best thing would be to make an expedition against the Mullah; but for the reasons I have stated, and apparently they are concurred in by the noble Lord, we did not consider that desirable. When I say I have stated the reasons I ought to add that the probability of the success of such an expedition, if success meant capture of the Mullah, was extremely remote. The great expedition which terminated in January, 1904, did not succeed in catching the Mullah. If I remember aright, there were 7,000 rifles of British troops in Somaliland at that time, and yet the Mullah got away, and anybody who studies the geography of the country will readily understand why. The noble Lord mentioned our Italian friends who are our neighbours there. An expedition of that kind, I think, could
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0315"/>
<col>579</col>
only be successful if the Italians on their side were prepared to take very costly steps indeed in blocking all possible outlets to the South by which the Mullah could get away, and I have no reason to suppose that they any more than we, although they, of course, and the tribes in which they are interested are subject to continual raids and attacks by the dervishes, would desire to engage in any enterprise the cost of which undoubtedly would have to be measured in millions.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord ingeniously argued that if it were true that the Mullah's prestige really was less, then that was a reason for staying in the country rather than for retiring to the coast. He argued it, I think, on the grounds that if the Mullah's power was broken we might proceed to establish something of a regular orderly administration in Somaliland throughout our Protectorate. I believe that to be an idle dream. I do not believe you could ever in Somaliland, considering the nature of the people, their habits, and their combative disposition, establish or attempt to establish anything of the nature of what would be called British administration throughout the country. Nor do I believe that you would be conferring the slightest benefit on the tribes if you did try. It is not in the least what they want. Our experience has brought us to believe that what the tribes mainly desire is to be left alone. They do not want to be administered by British political officers, and they would greatly prefer to be left to manage their own tribal affairs in their own way, even though such a state of things involved occasional intertribal fights of the kind which have been familiar. The noble Lord said, or implied at any rate, that the friendly tribes were wringing their hands at the notion of seeing us depart to the coast. I can only say that my information&#x2014;and I suspect it is better than the noble Lord's&#x2014;is precisely in the opposite direction. Of one thing I am quite certain, that no suggestion of any appeal for us to stay reached us in any shape or form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01202"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: There has not been time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01203"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord says there has not been time. It is quite evident that if such appeals had been made to the officers there, they would have held their hand and informed us of the fact. On the contrary, I think that it is undoubtedly
<col>580</col>
the case&#x2014;I do not say there may not be individuals who would have preferred us to remain&#x2014;that the great majority of the tribes in the Protectorate are not sorry that we are retiring in this way. They prefer, as I have said, to be left to manage their own affairs. The noble Lord asked me one or two definite questions. He asked about General De Brath. The noble Lord was in error as to the time at which General De Brath was communicated with. It was not before the Mission of Sir Reginald Wingate and Slatin Pasha. But there was an idea at one time of employing General De Brath to carry out the work which has since been carried out by Sir William Manning, and in the event the task was entrusted to Sir William Manning and not to General De Brath. Neither was it the case that when we asked Sir Reginald Wingate and Slatin Pasha to be good enough to go and make the inquiry, which they did, we had then decided that this withdrawal could now be carried into effect. It was in order to bring fresh and experienced minds to bear on the possibility of that policy that we asked Sir Reginald Wingate to go.<lb/>
The noble Lord asks why we have not published the report of Sir Reginald Wingate. The noble Lord knows as much about confidential reports as I do, and he is well aware that when a special inquiry is made in such a manner as that, it is frequently impossible to publish the terms of the report. I do not say that there are not parts of it which might be printed, but I do not think it would be desirable to do so. I do not think it would be fair to the authors of the report to do so, because the most valuable parts of it are undoubtedly of a confidential character and such as I should not be prepared in fairness to them to print. But I can say this, that the result of their report was such as to impress upon my mind and upon the mind of the Government the uselessness and the impossibility of attempting to maintain the present state of things; and from that point of view I do not hesitate to say that the mission of Sir Reginald Wingate helped us greatly in arriving at the conclusion at which we did arrive and upon which we are now acting.<lb/>
I think I have dealt with most of the points raised by the noble Lord, but I should like to say this. All through the consideration of this most anxious and difficult question the cardinal point in our minds was that we must not leave the friendly tribes to be
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0316"/>
<col>581</col>
swept away by a hostile invasion by the Mullah, and if I had not been satisfied in my mind that an invasion of that kind could not take place I for one should not have agreed to the policy. But that is not to say that I suppose that, if we withdraw, a period of complete peace would settle down on the country and that inter-tribal fights of the kind which our presence, unfortunately, has done so little to prevent and raids of the kind which have taken place, would not continue to take place. It was evident that that was bound to be so. But we certainly felt that it was our duty to see that the tribes within our Protectorate were, so far as we could compass it, placed in a position of self-defence. There has been no question, as the noble Lord appears to think, of handing out rifles to people who cannot use them. A number of people in Somaliland now&#x2014;too many I am afraid&#x2014;are trained to the use of the rifle, and they will, I hope, find that the possession of those arms will enable them to hold their own in those fights which, as we are afraid, will from time to time take place; but there will be nothing like the great sweeping invasion which the noble Lord mentioned. The phrase he used was that the tribes were abandoned to the Mullah. Nothing of the kind. From the information we have, we regard it as out of the question. It is doubtful, I think, if at any time the Mullah would have undertaken a great sweeping invasion of that kind if he had been in a position to do it, and undoubtedly now he is weaker and the friendly tribes are stronger. I have only, in conclusion, to say this&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01204"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Could the noble Earl tell us about the policy at the places on the coast?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01205"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Lord's pardon. We are holding Berbera, Bulhar, and Zeila. It has been among those on the spot a question as to whether it was desirable to hold Bulhar and Zeila. As at present advised, my own opinion is that it would not be wise to give up the retention of a small garrison at both those ports. The noble Lord will understand that I say that without prejudice to what decision may be reached on further inquiry, but at present the three ports and not the one only, are being held. What, in conclusion, I desire to say is this. We find that the policy of occupation and administration has, in our opinion, altogether broken down. We have not really succeeded in protecting
<col>582</col>
the tribes against raids on their stock, although we have gone to great expense&#x2014;last year we spent something like &#x00A3;100,000&#x2014;in endeavouring to do so. The two possible policies are those of a great military re-occupation of the country and of the withdrawal to the coast which we have undertaken. What I want to impress upon noble Lords is this, that if at any time it is desirable to carry out the former policy, to bring a great force of 8,000 or 10,000 men to sweep the whole country to its borders, you will be in practically no worse position for doing that now than you would be if we had held on to the posts in the interior. The immense amount of transport required for an expedition of that kind and the great preparations which have to be made would not be practically helped by the retention of these small military posts, with, say, half a battalion of men and some stores at one and the other. Therefore, if the noble Lord's melancholy prognostication is right, and some day you desire to send a great military expedition there, you will be practically in very much the same position as if you had decided upon that course a year ago. That, I think, is an important point to bear in mind, because I regard this whole proceeding as a piece of military strategy or policy or whatever you may please to call it&#x2014;not in the least as a great political event, and only so far political because the attempts at a political administration of the country have in our opinion broken down.<lb/>
I am sorry that the noble Lord spoke precisely in the terms he did. He was in the dilemma which befalls eloquent orators from time to time, that he could not denounce us as he did for our conduct without helping to do some of the mischief which he particularly wished to avoid. If a skilled speaker like the noble Lord, standing at the Table of this House, accuses His Majesty's Government of base desertion of friendly tribes, of the abandonment of those to whom we are bound by ties of honour, and of a general course of action which is a disgrace to the Empire&#x2014;if a noble Lord does that, there is some risk that those to whom that point of view had not occurred before may take it from him. Therefore I wish that the noble Lord had not, as I say, couched his denunciation of us in quite so high a key, but had been content to approach the matter in a somewhat more moderate spirit. I can assure him that the whole question has been one of ceaseless thought and anxiety to us, and we have taken the course
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0317"/>
<col>583</col>
we have&#x2014;a course which I absolutely deny involves any disgrace whatever to the Empire&#x2014;in the belief that it was the only course open to us in relation to a country&#x2014;and here I entirely agree with the noble Lord who spoke last&#x2014;into which we went as we do sometimes, without thought of the consequences and without considering whether we were doing either ourselves or the inhabitants of the country any real service in taking the course we did. In our opinion it is time to put a stop to that, and I believe that in so doing we shall be supported by the sober public opinion of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01206"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has called Lord Curzon to task for accusing the Government of deserting a number of friendly tribes in Somaliland. I fail to see that the noble Earl has in any way combated that statement. The noble Earl stated that he had persuaded himself that no sweeping invasion of the country was possible, but he failed to give us any reasons to justify that opinion. So far as we know, since the withdrawal was effected 800 friendlies have been killed. Well, that is a good start&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01207"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is scarcely a fair way to put it. A fight took place in which a large number on both sides were killed.

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01208"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I do not know how many men it is necessary should be killed in order to constitute a sweeping invasion. But, at all events, this is a pretty good start. We now learn that the Government are going to hold the three ports. That looks as if the position on the sea coast was not regarded with absolute calm. The noble Earl seemed to entirely leave out of the situation, or to deal with very cursorily, the intermediate policy as advocated by Captain Cordeaux on page 42 of the Blue-book. The noble Earl seemed to regard that as being an entirely impossible method of holding Somaliland, and he wished to make out that it was necessary to keep a large force of men in order to protect the cattle. I would point out that until the recent arrival of the Sirdar there had been no raiding at all, although Hargeisa was very lightly held. But since word got out that we were going to evacuate, the Dolbahanta
<col>584</col>
and other friendly tribes have lost many lives and some 8,000 camels. Seeing that Captain Cordeaux has laid down that this intermediate policy is the most desirable to pursue&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01209"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: He did nothing of the kind. The intermediate policy was the policy which we have been pursuing up to this time. I do not think the noble Lord will find anything in the Blue-book or anywhere else which implied that Captain Cordeaux regarded that as a policy which could be permanently pursued.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01210"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Has Captain Cordeaux gone back upon that opinion? I can only go by his opinion as expressed on page 42 of the Blue-book.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01211"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: At the time, yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01212"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: That policy seems to be a policy which met with success, and it involved no great expenditure of money or loss of life or of cattle to the inhabitants concerned. The point I want to get at is the attitude of the noble Earl towards these raided tribes themselves. He says there have been no appeals that we should remain. In 1885 we withdrew our garrison from a place not more than 150 or 200 miles from Hargeisa. I do not think there were any great shouts for those troops to remain, but within a few years of our withdrawal this district was twice invaded and no fewer than between ten and twelve thousand people were massacred. These Somalis are fully aware of what happened then, and that there is every chance that they will meet with the same fate at the hands of the very people who raided this district over twenty years ago. Under our protection these tribes have changed from a pastoral people to tillers of the soil. The result is that they have lost their habit of being fighting men, and in that respect are only a third of the value of the remaining Somalis who carry arms. They have built themselves houses and prospered under our <i>&#x0153;gis</i>, and they will regard our taking away the troops as a gross betrayal. I know from personal experience that it is extremely difficult to teach any of the Somalis how to shoot, and the distribution of rifles among them is simply, as Lord Curzon pointed out, giving those guns away to be picked up by the Mullah on any day he may choose. Already 8,000 camels have gone from the one side, and the Dolbahanta have suffered the loss of 800 men.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01216"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I am quite aware of that. Then as regards our prestige, matters are not so satisfactory in the centre of Africa to-day that we can suffer this loss of prestige through the abandonment of friendly tribes. I do not know that we can say that in certain portions of the Soudan the condition is absolutely satisfactory. I do not suppose the fact of our withdrawing the whole of our garrison from Somaliland will cause these people to think that England is stronger to-day. Then how are we going to reconcile our attitude in Somaliland with the continual outcry we make over the question of the Congo? To my mind it is nearly a parallel case. I am sorry that we are not to have any information as to Captain Cordeaux's views on the situation to-day. Judging from what appears on page 42 of the Blue-book he favoured the intermediate policy, and as far as one can make out that policy has met with considerable success.</membercontribution></p>

I think I am representing them correctly when I say that he believed it would have been possible at one time to take a regular expedition against the Mullah without going to the enormous cost which others, and which I am bound to say we at home, conceive would be involved, and he desired, as the noble Lord sees from the Blue-book, that an intermediate policy should be carried out in the hope of the Mullah's power breaking down in the interval, of which there were signs of its doing. Although I have no right to speak as to Captain Cordeaux's opinion at this moment, I have no reason to suppose that he believes that the course we are taking is not practically the only course possible to us in the circumstances in the absence of a really active and forward policy.</membercontribution></p>
<col>586</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01218"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one or two points require a little further elucidation. One has reference to the question raised by Lord Lovat in regard to our attitude towards the friendly tribes. The noble Earl opposite, at the beginning of his speech, said it would not have done to have promulgated beforehand that we intended to retire to the coast, and that it must be left to the officers on the spot to announce to the tribes that the action was to be taken and when it would be taken. Later on he remarked that there had been no objection raised on the part of the tribes or that no pronouncement to that effect had been made on the part of the officers. But, as Lord Curzon said, they have not had time to object. Then the noble Earl said that if the tribes had objected no doubt the officers on the spot would have reconsidered what action they should take. At one moment you are not going to give them any opportunity of expressing their views as to whether or not they want the protection continued, and at the next moment, according to the noble Earl, the officers on the spot would be in a position to reconsider the matter or to place it before the Government if the tribes did object to our leaving the country. I do not quite know which course it was intended by the Government should be adopted. But the strong point to my mind is that these are tribes with whom you have entered into definite treaties; yet you are not going to announce beforehand your intention of breaking these treaty undertakings. Why are they not to be given an opportunity of saying whether the treaties should be maintained or not? The noble Earl does safeguard the position to this extent, that he says that if the officers on the spot in making the announcement found that the tribes did object then those officers would be in a position to reconsider what action should be taken. That seems to me to be rather contradictory.<lb/>
I think one very serious point is the fact that we are not to have the views of Sir Reginald Wingate and Slatin Pasha. I can quite understand that where issues connected with foreign countries are involved these reports are confidential, but a report of this character has not those elements of seriousness and of danger. It surely could only deal with the relative position between ourselves and these tribes in Somaliland. Why, therefore, are we not to be informed of the opinions

of Sir Reginald Wingate? The noble Earl stated that His Majesty's Government were convinced of the uselessness of maintaining the present state of things. He did not say that was the opinion of Sir Reginald Wingate, but only that that was the Government's deduction founded on the report of that gentleman. But what we should like to know is what Sir Reginald Wingate's opinion was on the question of retirement. The noble Earl challenged Lord Curzon with being well known for an aggressive policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01219"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The word I used was "forward" policy&#x2014;a less offensive word, I think.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01220"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: But that is a very different thing from retiring from a position which you have already gained and in connection with which you have entered into treaty arrangements with other people, especially when your withdrawal places those people in a position of great disadvantage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01221"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl opposite began his observations by a criticism on the speech of my noble friend behind me which was, I think, somewhat instructive. He took exception to the terms of my noble friend's Motion, and said that it was quite erroneous to suggest that anything which can be properly described as the evacuation of the Somaliland Protectorate by His Majesty's Government was in contemplation or in progress. The noble Earl explained that there was no question of evacuation&#x2014;it was merely "coastal concentration"&#x2014;and that we were going to retain Berbera, Zeila, and Bulhar; and the noble Earl seems to think that retaining these three ports is the same thing as retaining your hold on the Somaliland Protectorate. I can assure him that, in the view of those most familiar with the subject, that is very far indeed from being the case.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl rather deprecated the warmth and energy of my noble friend's language when he depicted the results which are likely to follow from the evacuation of the Protectorate; and he suggested that those remarks might have a more unfortunate effect out of doors. I am afraid that I must point out that no words that can be used in this House by my noble friend or by anyone
<col>588</col>
else are likely to have anything like the effect in Somaliland or in the regions adjoining Somaliland of the mere bald announcement which no doubt has by this time flown over the whole of the country&#x2014;that it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to retire from the Protectorate.<lb/>
I do not suppose that there are many of us who look back with entire satisfaction to the history of our relations with Somaliland. The noble Earl spoke of liabilities which we incur without thought of the consequences. The noble Earl was rather hard, I think, upon his own predecessors in title, because the Protectorate of Somaliland was assumed by Mr. Gladstone's Government in the year 1885, and I think it would be hardly just to describe that obligation as having been incurred without cause and in a thoughtless manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01222"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think perhaps I ought to explain. I do not say that the Government of 1885 may not have made mistakes like all other Governments, but what I consider was an unfortunate commitment was the attempt to introduce into Somaliland what is known as the policy of "peaceful penetration" and direct administration of the country rather than adopting the policy followed in regard to the <i>hinterland</i> of Aden, where the people are allowed to govern themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01223"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: People even ask why we should ever have gone to Somaliland at all. I was looking a few hours ago at a somewhat out-of-date atlas in the Library of your Lordships' House, and I observed that there was a legend inscribed on the Somali Protectorate running as follows, "Myrrh, frankincense and other aromatics." I do not think it has ever entered anyone's head to go to Somaliland for anything so attractive. But I have heard that we had an excuse for going there because the Protectorate produced mutton for the garrison at Aden. That was to some extent a substantial argument, but the real reason why we went there&#x2014;and I think it is much better to say these things quite frankly&#x2014;was that we could not afford to let anyone else go there.<lb/>
At the time when Mr. Gladstone's Government undertook the Protectorate a great <i>d&#x00E9;b&#x00E2;cle</i> was proceeding in Egypt. There was much activity on the part of several Powers
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0320"/>
<col>589</col>
which were engaged in staking out claims for themselves in different parts of the world, and we, it seems to me very properly, came to the conclusion that we could not afford to allow any foreign Power to possess the seaboard opposite the great Imperial stronghold of Aden, and for that reason the Protectorate was assumed. It is quite true that our interests lay mainly on the seaboard, but it can be easily imagined how difficult it became to restrict our activity absolutely to the seaboard itself. And the fact remains that the Government of the day&#x2014;I do not desire to treat this subject in any way from a Party point of view, but it was the same Government that assumed the Protectorate&#x2014;thought it their duty to enter into these treaties with some of the loyal tribes. My noble friend quoted from memory, and I think not inaccurately, the text of one of these treaties. I happen to have it by me. May I read the actual words?
<quote>"The British Government is desirous of maintaining and strengthening relations of peace and friendship with the tribes, and in compliance with their wish undertakes to extend to them and to the territories under their authority and jurisdiction the gracious favour and protection of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress."</quote>
Those words were surely not mere idle words, nor could they have been so interpreted by those who were aware of their existence. They seem to me to be entirely inconsistent with the theory that we had no liabilities in those days extending beyond the coast line.<lb/>
Another reason which led us away from the coast was that it became necessary to delimit the boundaries of our spheres of influence with France and Italy; and that happened which almost always must happen in such cases. If you exclude other people from a certain area, in spite of yourself you assume responsibilities for that which takes place within the area from which other people are excluded. The old policy in those days, unless I very much misunderstand it, was a policy based upon excluding the influence of other Powers from the Protectorate, upon keeping open the principal trade routes within a reasonable distance of the ports, and affording to the friendly tribes protection consistent with the terms of the treaties of 1885. The whole situation however was, of course, entirely altered by the appearance on the scene of the Mullah. We might very well have rubbed alone on the old lines
<col>590</col>
but for that. But when the Mullah appeared on the scene and raided the whole country, and even, as the noble Earl knows, threatened Berbera itself, our hands were forced, and we were compelled to do more than we had done before. That, I think, explains the point dealt with by my noble friend Lord Harris, who mentioned that there had been a certain development of our policy subsequently to the period in which the Government of Bombay had been charged with the administration of Somaliland. It was entirely in consequence of the appearance of the Mullah that those disastrously expensive operations took place which occurred in the years 1901, 1902, and 1903, operations which ended with General Egerton's success at Jidballi&#x2014;a success which we all then hoped would put an end, at any rate for a considerable time, to the mischievous activity of the Mullah.<lb/>
The noble Earl told the House that at that time the policy of the then Government, of which I had the honour to be a member, did not differ greatly from the policy which His Majesty's Government have in view at the present time. I am afraid I must tell the noble Earl that the difference was rather greater than he supposes. I have some recollection, and some knowledge based upon documents, of the policy which was in the contemplation of the Cabinet in 1904. What were the principal points in that policy? In the first place, we sent out General Swaine, who had a special knowledge of the tribes, with instructions to take charge of the Protectorate, and to arm and organise the tribes in such a manner as to render them able to protect themselves "after a time." I lay stress upon those words, because that clearly indicated that we conceived it would take a considerable period of time to accustom the tribes to the idea of taking care of their own safety. It was at that moment that we began to give arms to the tribes, which until then had been refused arms on the ground that we were precluded from allowing arms to pass into their hands under various international agreements with which the noble Earl is acquainted. In the next place, the principal caravan routes were to be kept open, there was to be a moderate subsidy given to the tribes, and, what is most important, we contemplated the retention of a nucleus of Regulars at
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0321"/>
<col>591</col>
Berbera, while two battalions of Indian troops were to remain for the present at any rate at Bohotleh. Unless I am greatly mistaken that is a correct description of the policy of the Government of 1904, and it seems to me to differ materially from the policy which has been described to us this evening by the noble Earl opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01224"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I ask a question? The noble Marquess mentions the retention of some Indian troops at Bohotleh. That was not intended to be a permanent arrangement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01225"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01226"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Except for that I confess the noble Marquess has, if I may say so, given a description more or less of what we are doing at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01227"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Then am I to understand that the principal caravan routes are to be kept open, and that a British officer is to have charge of the Protectorate and to arm and organise the tribes so as to render them able to protect themselves?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01228"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is what we hope has been done&#x2014;that the tribes are now in a condition to defend themselves against outside attack.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01229"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The operation must have been a wonderfully rapid one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01230"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: A great many of the tribes have been armed. Ever since the date of which the noble Marquess is speaking there has been a distinct tribal Militia. I cannot say it has been entirely successful, but so far as the arming of tribes is concerned that has gone on&#x2014;I do not say on a very large scale&#x2014;ever since.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01231"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl may take it that the policy of 1904 was based on the assumption that although we could not give complete protection to the tribes&#x2014;because there never could have been any intention of following every herd of cattle that goes to drink at a watering place to see that somebody does not raid it&#x2014;we did not contemplate a retirement from the
<col>592</col>
obligations imposed upon us by the treaties of 1885.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01232"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do understand that at that time it was contemplated that there should be no troops of any kind at the coast, that the tribes should be encouraged to defend themselves, and that the keeping open of the caravan routes was not to be carried out by troops in the service of His Majesty but by the tribes themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01233"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The best way in which I can put it is this. I remember distinctly that we had before us then the policy of what is now called coastal concentration, and after considering it we deliberately put it on one side. Of that I have no doubt whatever. We did so in great measure because we believed that the effects of such a policy upon our position in Abyssinia and in the Soudan would be most unfortunate. I remember, indeed, that we consulted Lord Cromer on the subject&#x2014;I regret that the noble Lord is not in his place&#x2014;and that he expressed an opinion adverse to the policy of retirement.<lb/>
Then I turn to the policy of His Majesty's Government. I am not at all sure that I ought to use the word policy in the singular, because, as far as I understand these Papers, the Government have had two policies before them and that within a recent time. The policy which we find described in the Blue-book, page 62, is a policy for the gradual and cautious reduction of the military force, and there is that most remarkable passage&#x2014;I am not sure whether my noble friend quoted it&#x2014;in which the Colonial Office informed General Manning that&#x2014;
<quote>"the evacuation is not to be carried out unless and until the friendly tribes can reasonably be said to be in a position to hold their own against the Mullah."</quote>
It was quoted a few days ago by the representative of the Colonial Office in the other House of Parliament. Is that the present policy of His Majesty's Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01234"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Undoubtedly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01235"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Earl maintain that at this moment, when we are receiving accounts of bodies of friendly tribesmen being cut up, these tribes can reasonably be said to be in a position to hold their own?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0322"/>
<col>593</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01236"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I did not wish to waste time, but perhaps I had better read the telegrams. In a telegram, dated March 18, and received in the Colonial Office on the 20th of that month, Sir W. Manning stated that he had received information that the Mijjertein Isa and Mahmoud on March 7 raided the Mullah's live stock, capturing 1,000 camels near Halin, killing many dervishes, and capturing twenty-three rifles. That was a success. Then comes the failure of which the noble Lord spoke. In a further telegram dated March 29, Sir W. Manning stated that he had on that day received information of an attack by the dervishes on a party of the Yahelli combination of Hadega, that the friendlies were surprised by a large force, and that there were many killed on both sides. He stated further that the friendlies had retired to Eil Dab, and that among the killed were two chiefs. That is not quite the same thing as the sort of massacre which was described in the newspapers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01237"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I did not refer to a massacre. I desire to impress upon the House that the evacuation which is taking place is something different from that gradual and cautious operation which is contemplated in the Papers on the Table of your Lordships' House. We have pressed for information as to the opinion of those who may properly be described as experts in connection with this question. The noble Earl gave us, and we are grateful to him, the opinion of Captain Cordeaux. If I did not misunderstand it, I think we might claim Captain Cordeaux as an advocate of what I think my noble friend behind me described as the intermediate policy as distinguished from the abrupt and radical policy which His Majesty's Government are pursuing. Then we have asked, and asked in vain, for the opinions of Sir Rudolph Slatin and Sir Reginald Wingate. The noble Earl gave us a shred of information on that point. He told us that their reports impressed on his mind the necessity of evacuation, but what we should like to know is whether that was the course advocated by these two distinguished officers themselves. That is quite another matter so it seems to me, because the noble Earl, with all his knowledge of administration, will not, I think, claim to be a military authority in regard to questions of this sort.<lb/>
Then with regard to the tribes, I agree with my noble friend behind me that the
<col>594</col>
moment for this operation is ill-chosen. We have it in evidence that the Mullah, I think the expression was, is not the same Mullah that he formerly was. He has evidently lost a considerable amount of prestige, and it seems to me that if ever there was a moment when time was upon our side and when we ought to have conducted the operation of withdrawal with at any rate a decent amount of deliberation, such a moment had arrived in the history of Somaliland. I am bound to say that while I deplore the effect of the decision of His Majesty's Government insofar as the inhabitants of Somaliland themselves are concerned, I deplore it much more on account of the remoter consequences which in our belief it is likely to have. It is a step which will certainly have been watched and taken note of over the whole of that part of Africa, and I am much mistaken if its effect will not be to strike a serious blow at the authority and good name of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01238"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the exhaustive speech of the noble Marquess to which we have just listened it is, of course, unnecessary for me to attempt to cover any large extent of ground; but there are one or two small points as to which I have been challenged on which reply seems necessary. One is a very small point which concerns nobody but myself. The noble Earl opposite accuses me of being a consistent and, I think he said, a foremost champion of the forward policy. I should like to put my reputation in that respect in the hands of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India who sits beside him. He is aware of the policy which the Government of which I was the head pursued in India, and he will agree that the last attribute that could possibly have been ascribed to that policy was that of forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01239"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord mentioned that among the retirements we should have to pay for were those from Cabul and Chitral. That surprised me, because I thought he was in sympathy with the policy which prompted those retirements. I should have been the last to speak of his policy as forward until he made that remark.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01240"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I should like to recover my reputation in the estimation of the noble Earl. I said that Chitral and Afghanistan were cases where
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0323"/>
<col>595</col>
in the one instance the policy of evacuation favoured by the Government of the day had been abandoned by their successors, and we had been compelled to go back, and where in the other it would be rash to prophesy as to the future. However, that is neither here nor there. There is another small point of fact about which I should like to put myself straight. There has been some dispute as to what has happened as the direct consequence of this evacuation of the interior of Somaliland. There has been a little controversy as to what has occurred in the case of these unfortunate Dolbahanta. The noble Earl represents the matter as an ordinary incident of tribal warfare&#x2014;that these people attacked the Mullah's force and secured some momentary advantage, and the Mullah's force attacked them in return and they were defeated. It really is very much more than that. These Dolbahanta are people whom we have always kept up as a buffer between the friendly tribes and the Mullah. The evacuation takes place, and the first thing the Mullah does is to fall upon these people in our sphere of influence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01241"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is not so. There has been a good deal of desultory fighting between the Mullah and the Dolbahanta for some time past. What really happened is that the Dolbahanta are now so well armed that they thought themselves strong enough to go and attack the Mullah.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01242"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I dare say my information comes from a source quite as good as the noble Earl's. The second case occurred on the other side of the frontier. It is the fact that as soon as the Ogaden tribes on that portion of the frontier heard that Sir Reginald Wingate was coming out&#x2014;and they knew pretty well with what general instructions he was coming&#x2014;they started raiding the tribes in our area.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01243"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to again interrupt the noble Lord. But may I ask how he knows that the Ogaden tribes knew what Sir Reginald Wingate's instructions were, and, even if they did, how it would have helped, because when Sir Reginald Wingate went out no instructions were given for withdrawal to him or to anybody else?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01244"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to carry on a dispute across the floor of the House. But the intention of His Majesty's Government to retire has
<col>596</col>
been for some time anticipated and known in Somaliland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01245"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01246"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am speaking on the authority of those who have recently been in the country, who have just come from the country and have had contact with the tribes to which I refer. I am assured by them that these incidents have occurred since the intention of His Majesty's Government to retire became known. I mention it in illustration of the argument that the news of evacuation, and still more the effect of evacuation, have already had consequences which we should all deplore. One other word about the tribes. The noble Earl tells us that the tribes have always been armed. I believe he is not altogether correct in that statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01247"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that the tribes have been armed in the sense that every man, or anything like every man, has been armed, but a certain number of them have had arms undoubtedly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01248"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: No, the fact is that there has been a small tribal Militia. Not only have the tribes not been armed but we have deliberately refused to allow them to obtain arms, and it is due to this that they are in the impotent position that they are incapable of withstanding the Mullah or anybody else. Then the noble Earl said that his opinion is that the tribes wish us to go. I can assure him, from information derived from those who are in direct contact with the tribes, that that is not the case. So far from the tribes wishing us to go they are dismayed at the announcement of our intended withdrawal. The condition of affairs as depicted by the noble Earl is not really in accordance with the facts of the case.<lb/>
One other point. The noble Earl seemed to think that of the three policies about which we have been talking&#x2014;the policy of an expedition, with which none of us would agree; the policy of evacuation, which is the policy of His Majesty's Government; and the intervening policy, that recommended by the Commissioner on the spot&#x2014;the third of these was an undesirable policy because it only consisted of occasional movements of troops to prevent raids, and because it might be attended with some idea of extending ordinary civil administration
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0324"/>
<col>597</col>
in the country. Lot me assure the noble Earl that that is not the case. So far from these troops being employed for occasional excursions to prevent raiding, what really occurred was that at the places where the British officer and his troops were stationed there was a state of settled order and peace, and on the Western part of Somaliland not a single case has occurred in which our friendly tribes have been raided. That is what their influence has effected. As regards civil administration, no more than the noble Earl would I recommend for a moment introducing among these wild nomad tribes what we would call ordinary civil administration. These officers never did that, and no one would argue that they should. What our officers did was to compose inter-tribal quarrels, and in this way they were effective in preventing raids; and by withdrawing them now the peace of the interior is gone.<lb/>
The noble Earl told us that this was not a great political event. It may not be to him
<col>598</col>
or to His Majesty's Government or to any one in this country. But I do venture to say that it is a great political event to the people out there to whom we are referring. I cannot help noticing that the noble Earl has refrained from saying one word about the treaty obligations under which we are placed. He has not met in any way the charge that we are breaking the ancient pledges we have entered into with these tribes, and he has said nothing as to the effect that may be exercised upon our prestige in the neighbouring parts of Africa. The impression left on my mind by the debate is that there is even less to be said for the case of the Government than I had inferred, and that the policy of evacuation, even if it be a policy of evacuation only of the interior, is likely to be attended with all the unfortunate consequences which I have ventured to anticipate. I beg to withdraw my Motion for Papers.</membercontribution></p>

The telegram is dated from Somaliland on April 6. General Manning states that later news has since modified the information which he telegraphed on March 29. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"It is now stated that the number of friendlies killed was under 200, and that the rifles lost numbered fewer than 150. The Dervishes' loss was undoubtedly severe, and included the following leaders."</quote>
He mentions three names which I think would not convey very much to your Lord-ships, but one of them at any rate was a very important leader of the Dervishes. He then says&#x2014;
<quote>"It is still the intention of the Yahelli combination to make reprisals. They are in a strong position to carry out their intention. The tribes are now generally in a much better position to defend themselves than they were while we occupied the interior."</quote>
Sir William Manning adds that it must be remembered that all sorts of exaggerated reports as to the doings of the Dervishes are current at Aden, and that for the sake of sensation such news is readily accepted there for transmission.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARMY (ANNUAL) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01262" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01263">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01264"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill. There is one provision in it of considerable importance for the amendment of the Army Act, the effect of which is to give to the commanding officer considerably greater powers of punishment than he has had hitherto. Up to 1906 the maximum punishment that he could give was fourteen days imprisonment, or, in the particular case of absence without leave, twenty-one days. In 1906 his powers were practically decreased, because detention was substituted for imprisonment, and detention is, of course, a much milder form of punishment. What we now ask is that he should be allowed to award detention up to twenty-eight days.<lb/>
The advantages are these. If you increase the powers of the commanding officer in this way it means that he will be able to award punishment to men who would otherwise have to go to a district court-martial, and there is no doubt that it is greatly to the advantage of a man to be able to be punished by his commanding officer rather than by a court-martial. It affects him in regard to his conduct sheet; and having to go to a court-martial probably means that he gets a less good report at the end of his service, which is a matter of great importance to him when he goes into civil life. Then there is the question of the time and expense of district courts-martial. A district court-martial has to be composed of officers of other corps besides the one in which the man is serving. If the man who is to be tried happens to be in an outlying detachment, very often considerable delay is incurred in assembling the court-martial, and, of course, there is the expense as well. Besides, a great deal of this is absolutely unnecessary.<lb/>
Seventy per cent. of the men who go before district courts-martial plead guilty when they get there, and I should think that the majority of the offences that they have committed and for which they are to be punished come under paragraph 583 of the King's Regulations, which gives twenty-eight days detention as the maximum for those classes of offences; so that in a very large number of these cases it is practically
<col>602</col>
settled beforehand what is going to happen to the man, and in those circumstances it seems futile that a court-martial should have to be assembled in order to pass sentence upon him. There, is also, of course, the necessity of safeguarding the soldier against the undue exercise of the summary powers which we are proposing to confer on the commanding officer. If the commanding officer proposes to allot any other punishment than a minor one, he is bound to give the soldier his choice whether he will accept the punishment which the commanding officer metes out to him or go before a district court-martial. I think one may safely say that, on the whole, the soldier very much prefers to be tried by his commanding officer than by a district court-martial. The soldier feels that he is being tried by a man who knows him and who will be as indulgent as he can within the limits of his duty, and there is no doubt that in most cases the men prefer being tried by the commanding officer.<lb/>
Only about one-half per cent.&#x2014;that is to say, only one in 200&#x2014;of the men who are brought before their commanding officer and given the option of being punished by him or of going to a district court-martial elects to go before the court-martial. The soldier's safeguard remains as it was before. Increasing the power of the commanding officer to award punishment does not mean that the soldier cannot, if he desires, be tried, as at present, before a district court-martial. I believe that this amendment which we are proposing is really in the interests of the soldier. It is going to do away with a very large number of courts-martial, and it is a reform of which opinion in the Army as far as we have been able to gauge it, and we have made extensive inquiries, is unanimously in favour. I therefore hope your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0005P0I0327"/>
<col>603</col>
your Lordships with any speech in moving the Second Reading of this Bill. Its object is, as I explained in introducing it to your Lordships [&#x2020;], to consolidate and simplify the law relating to perjury and kindred offences. I am very glad to know that the Lord Chief Justice is going to extend his assistance, not only in the passing of this Bill but with the other Bills which I hope will follow for the consolidation of the criminal law. His support will give great authority to the steps we are taking in this direction, and will give confidence, no doubt, in both Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01270">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Chancellor.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01271"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has been good enough to refer to me, I hope your Lordships will allow me to make a few observations on this matter, which I conceive to be one of great importance. I wish, in the first place, to congratulate my noble and learned friend on his great industry in taking up this matter again, and I hope he will bring it to a successful issue. He told the House, when moving the First Reading of the Bill, that he and others had been giving much consideration to this matter; and though I have been working during the last few days under strict medical orders, I have been able to give some time to this Bill. The drafting I think extremely good. It is not a consolidation Bill in the strict sense of the term. It is more than an ordinary consolidation Bill and puts into plain and simple language a large number of Statutes. That is of great advantage to the Judges, for if Parliament will put its enactments into simple language a great deal of our labour will be saved.<lb/>
But the criminal law does not depend on Statutes alone. It depends to a large extent on the decisions of eminent Judges which have been given in the past, and which are embodied in the text-books that we have to consult. Some of these matters are not absolutely free from discussion, and it is essential that in a consolidation Bill of this kind there should be some form of amendment. This is a Bill to deal with the law of perjury. It has long been a matter of discussion whether the question of the materiality of a corrupt statement should be for the Judge or the jury. All I can say is that, after a considerable amount of experience,
<col>604</col>
I think the Bill has adopted a wise course in making the question of materiality one for the Judge. It is extremely difficult to explain to a jury what materiality is, and as it must be dealt with by a trained mind I think this is an important improvement in the law.<lb/>
I do not propose to go through the various clauses in the Bill, as they will be discussed by the Joint Committee of both Houses to whom I hope the Bill will be subsequently referred. In the other House I had a great deal to do with endeavouring to pass Bills which my noble and learned friend below me (Lord Halsbury) sent down to the House of Commons. I did my best, not unfortunately with much success, to get the House of Commons to pay attention to those measures. I cannot help thinking that amendment and consolidation should not be combined in one Bill. That was brought to my notice by Mr. Gladstone, who was good enough, in his great kindness, to point out to me the difficulty in the House of Commons of amending and consolidating at the same time; and he strongly recommended me in connection with any proposed measure to prepare a short Bill of the amendments in the first instance and let it be discussed, and then bring in the consolidation Bill. The result is that you get the Government draftsmen framing the consolidation Bill when the amendments have been made. I do not say that by way of criticism of this Bill. I do hope that these labours will not be thrown away, and I am glad that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack is proposing to deal with this matter by referring the Bill to a Joint Committee of the two Houses. I hope that may to a certain extent lubricate the friction which might otherwise occur in another place, and thus tend to the passing of the Bill into law.<lb/>
This Bill is an object-lesson as to what I would call the waste of time that takes place in our public life. I refer to the way in which work is done by Commissions and Committees and embodied in Blue-books and nothing more ever comes of it. Let us take this particular case. In 1894 a Perjury Consolidation Bill was brought in by Lord Herschell, who was one of the pioneers in one sense of the modern consolidation Acts. That Bill was referred to a Committee consisting of Lord Herschell, my predecessor Lord Russell, Lord
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0328"/>
<col>605</col>
Halsbury, and Lord Ashbourne. They worked at it for a considerable time, and produced a Bill which I am sure contained most valuable suggestions, many of which I daresay appear in this Bill. That Bill went down to the House of Commons in 1895. It may be that it did not become law then because of the Dissolution, but when my noble and learned friend below me attempted to get time for that Bill in subsequent sessions it was found to be hopeless. I am not saying this from any Party point of view, for my observations apply to both sides. But it is regrettable that when these attempts are made by distinguished lawyers to improve the law nothing further should happen, and I hope that this effort on the part of my noble and learned friend will be successful.<lb/>
I only desire to say that as far as I am concerned, compatible with my other duties, and so far as my learned brothers are concerned, we shall be only too glad to render every assistance in our power. I do not make this observation in connection with this Bill alone. I have long desired to see the mass of Statutes on the criminal law put into some shape so that they can be understood generally instead of being a sort of puzzle which the Judges have to construe. Of all branches of the law it is most important that there should be simplicity in connection with the criminal law, whatever you may leave of doubt for the real property lawyer or for those who have not got the liberties of our fellow subjects to consider. I have detained your Lordships in order to express my hearty satisfaction at the step which my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack has taken, and I hope that the result of the reference of this Bill to a Joint Committee will be that his labours will not be thrown away, because I am quite certain that there is no more useful thing that can be done than to endeavour by a series of steps to reduce the criminal law of this country into some shape so that it can be understood generally by the unlearned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01272"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will you allow me to thank my noble and learned friend for his support of this Bill, and to say a very few words with regard to the subjects that he has raised? The Bill is intended not to alter the law, but to simplify it. I am not one of those who
<col>606</col>
believe that there is any mystery at all about the law of this country. The only mystery is in the inexplicable confusion caused by Statute on Statute and decision on decision. The law itself is perfectly simple when it is explained by a man who understands it, or when it is put into a simple form in the shape of a Bill. This Bill is in the form which people can understand. I hope that this will be the first step in the consolidation of the criminal law as well as of criminal procedure. If we can get forward this Bill and the others which are to follow, we intend to proceed with the matter until we have a code, not only of the criminal law but also of the criminal procedure of this country, couched in such simple language as to be understood by the public at large. That is our purpose.<lb/>
My noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice has suggested that amendment and consolidation should not be combined in one Bill. I will tell him the procedure which we have adopted. In preceding years we have had Joint Committees of both Houses to which four or five Bills of a consolidating character have been referred. I had the honour of being selected by the Joint Committee as Chairman in each case. What happened was this. We examined the Bills very closely to see, that they were strictly in accordance with the law as it is. We had two schedules, which were recommended by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, one of which contained those cases where there might be a point of difference though it might not be a substantial one, and the other contained any amendments which the Committee thought fit to recommend, and which might be called of a substantial, though not controversial, character. Beyond that we did not go. Both Houses of Parliament had the certificate of the Committee that the Bill represented the law as it was, and in the case of any amendments proposed they were set out and the reasons for them given in the two schedules. There was on no single occasion any difference of opinion in the Committee either as regards the actual contents of the Bill or the amendments made, and without discussion and upon that explanation both Houses accepted in each case every amendment to the Bills. That is the method I propose to adopt with regard to this and the following Bills&#x2014;in other words, to avoid all controversy, to simplify
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0329"/>
<col>607</col>
and clarify the law and nothing further. Whether we shall be equally successful in the future I cannot predict, but so far as I am concerned I have done my best in that direction.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NON-COLLECTION OF INCOME TAX.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01275"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government why they do not pass the usual Resolution authorising the collection of the Income Tax in anticipation of the Budget Bill, as has been the invariable practice for many years past. Almost the last day before the holidays the subject of the Question which I desire to put to the noble Earl the Leader of the House gave rise to an interesting discussion in the House of Commons, and I shall very likely be told that it is unnecessary therefore to revive the question. The answers given were, however, so extraordinary that the fact seems an additional reason for doing so.<lb/>
As the House is aware, for many years and under Chancellors of the Exchequer representing both Parties in the State, immediately after the Budget statement Resolutions have been passed authorising the collection of the Income Tax and certain duties, such as those on tea, tobacco, and alcohol, which would otherwise lapse. Why has not this been done now? As regards Income Tax on coupons and dividend warrants, banks, companies, and financial houses have been, and are, collecting the Income Tax at the rate of 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. The usual course is that at the end of the quarter the banks and other companies notify the amount to the Inland Revenue, and then receive instructions to pay the same to the Accountant-General. At the end of last year they intimated the amount they had received for the preceding quarter, and which they were prepared to pay over. Another quarter has now expired. They have, however, received no instructions to pay over the amount they hold. Government, we know, are borrowing largely;
<col>608</col>
here is a very large sum which must amount to some millions, and yet the Government do not claim it, but prefer to borrow at the expense of the taxpayer.<lb/>
The Prime Minister told us in December that immediately on the re-assembling of Parliament&#x2014;
<quote>"If we are fortunate enough to enjoy its confidence, then our first act will be to re-impose from this week all the taxes and duties which were embodied in the Finance Bill and to validate all past collections and deductions. In the meantime all persons desiring to do so may deposit with the proper officers the appropriate duty at the rate so sanctioned, and full instructions and information will be forthwith issued by the Departments concerned."</quote>
He added&#x2014;
<quote>"It is our duty to do what we can without any infringement of the law or of constitutional principles to mitigate hardships and inconveniences."</quote>
Again, in his speech at Oxford the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"There are reasons which seem to my colleagues to be unanswerable for pushing the Budget forward with all possible promptitude."</quote>
Then why do they not do so? Parliament met on the 15th of February. It is now April, and yet they have not done so. The Budget has crumbled away under criticism. In reality the country has decided against it. Liberal and Labour Members&#x2014;and I am not sure that they are all in favour of the Budget&#x2014;number 315. The Irish are against it, and with the Unionists the number is 355. This, I may say in passing, fully justifies the action of your Lordships last session, and is no doubt the reason why the Government have not yet brought the Budget on. It is the Veto, not of your Lordships, but of Mr. Redmond. They know that in the present House of Commons there is, or was, a majority against it. No doubt the Prime Minister may induce the Nationalists to pass the Budget by the promise of Home Rule. They may consider that the advantages of Home Rule outweigh the disadvantages of the Budget. But the fact remains that the majority of the present House of Commons did agree with your Lordships that the Budget was unwise and unjust.<lb/>
I am not, however, dealing with the Budget Bill, but with the Resolution. According to the report of his Oxford speech, the Prime Minister professes to give an answer. I have doubted whether the report could be correct, for it is obvious that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0330"/>
<col>609</col>
the reason given cannot be the real one. He is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"Ever since 1861 the Budget has been treated, not as a series of Bills dealing with separate taxes, but as one integral and interdependent scheme, and we are certainly not going to be the first &#x2026;. to depart from the great financial precedent set us by the greatest of financiers."</quote>
But who has asked them for a series of Bills? We submit, no doubt, that as they themselves tell us a Budget Bill&#x2014;I say a Budget Bill, not the Budget. Bill of last year&#x2014;ought to be, and has not been, pressed forward with "all possible promptitude." But that is not the question I am now asking the noble Earl the Leader of the House. The Government are departing from "the great financial precedent set us by the greatest of financiers"; they are departing from the course which has been followed ever since 1861; and we wish to know the reason why.<lb/>
It is reported in the City&#x2014;I do not vouch for it myself, but the noble Earl will no doubt tell us if it is a mistake&#x2014;that some of the great railway companies were prepared to pay over the amounts due from them, and the Inland Revenue were prepared to undertake to repay the money should the matter not be regularised, but at the last moment, as is understood owing to the intervention of the Chancellor, the arrangement was cancelled and the payment stopped. I hope the noble Earl will tell us what has really happened. At present the position is most anomalous. While in the main the Income Tax is not being collected it is being collected in some places and from some classes. The Government, for instance, we are told are collecting it from their own <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> and from officers in the Army. It is said that they are returning in some cases Income Tax which they have not received! Now we desire to know why the Chancellor of the Exchequer is departing from the invariable practice of his predecessors, inflicting these heavy losses on the taxpayer and throwing the finances of the country into such confusion. All other Chancellors have desired to secure a surplus. Mr. Lloyd-George seems to wish to create the greatest possible deficit. The House of Commons has been adjourning night after night very early, often even before dinner; yet the Government have not passed the ordinary Income Tax Resolution, and it really seems as if they deliberately wished to throw the finances of the country into confusion.<lb/>
<col>610</col>
The Government are, moreover, imposing considerable and unnecessary losses on the country, for there are immense sums lying at the disposal of Government, and yet the Chancellor does not collect them, but prefers to borrow and pay interest, the burden of which will fall on the taxpayer. The fall in the Income Tax is, in round numbers, &#x00A3;20,000,000, the interest on which, at three per cent., is. &#x00A3;600,000. The financial policy of the Government is involving the country in this heavy loss. Nor is this all; it is shaking confidence, as we see in the continuous and alarming fall in our national securities. Since the present Government came into power the securities of the other great Powers have risen; ours, and ours alone, have fallen heavily, and are continuing to fall. No wonder that the attacks on your Lordships' House and what seems to many the reckless mismanagement of our national finances create uneasiness and anxiety among English investors. Consols fall lower and lower. The present opinion in the City is no doubt that expressed last week by Mr. Gibbs and Sir Marcus Samuel. Mr. Gibbs spoke of "organised confusion which was being brought into the finances of the country"; and Sir Marcus Samuel characterised the present position as a device&#x2014;he used, indeed, a stronger term&#x2014;of the Government in which the interests of the taxpayers were sacrificed in order, if possible, to secure a Party advantage. That is certainly a very general impression amongst business men, and the impression of many who are not Unionists. Mr. Sydney Brooks, for instance, himself a strong Radical, in an article in last month's <i>Fortnightly</i>, condemns the Government "for prolonging the chaos at the Exchequer in some pitiful and fantastic hope of Party gain." I am not, however, now expressing any opinion myself, but am asking for an explanation. There can be no doubt that the non-collection of the revenue is involving the country in heavy loss, that it is introducing great confusion into our national finances, and shaking public confidence. As far as we can see there is no reason why the necessary Resolution should not have been passed, and the collection of revenue resumed. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01276"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Earl answers the Question I should like to put before him the latest phase of this Income Tax question, and with the permission of the House I will give the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0331"/>
<col>611</col>
example of a company in which I am slightly interested, merely saying that it is the largest and the most important company in this country. This company is in the habit of paying its Income Tax at the end of December and at the end of March, and each of those two payments comes to nearly &#x00A3;150,000. My noble friend Lord Avebury alluded in his speech to a promise that was undoubtedly given on several occasions by the Prime Minister that the first act of the Government if they came back to power would be to regularise the finances of this country'. Further, the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition in your Lordships' House said distinctly that, so far as the Opposition were concerned, they would gladly acquiesce in any Resolution that was brought in to regularise the finances, more especially the Income Tax at the rate of 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;.<lb/>
This company received a letter on December 6, written from the Office of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax, 49, Wellington-street, Strand, informing them that the moiety of the Income Tax assessable in respect of the profits of the company was &#x00A3;148,811, and that if this sum was tendered as usual on or about December 21 it would be accepted by the Accountant-General. The company, in view of the fact that they had the speeches of the Prime Minister before them and also the promise of the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House that he would acquiesce in any Resolution with regard to the Income Tax, paid that &#x00A3;148,811. On March 10 last a similar letter was received from the Special Commissioners of Income Tax. Then, of course, a grave question arose for this company to consider what they ought to do in the circumstances. They came to the conclusion that their business was to look after the interests of their shareholders&#x2014;in point of fact, that the company must not pay this second great whack, if I may use the expression, of Income Tax unless they were quite certain they would not have to pay it over again if no Budget was passed and if the shareholders demanded their Income Tax. The company desired to pay this money, and I have reason to believe that the Government were anxious to get it.<lb/>
What could the company do? They were willing to pay if the Government would guarantee the repayment of the money should the Budget not be passed. Whether the Government could give such
<col>612</col>
a guarantee I do not know, though there was a question on the subject in the House of Commons. We took the highest legal opinion we could get, and came to the conclusion that no agent, not even the First Lord of the Treasury, could bind the Government unless the agent was hedged round by certain safeguards which were hardly possible in the case of the Prime Minister. Therefore the company were in this position, that they could not get a guarantee that the money would be repaid to them; and this pitiful result remains, that the company, who are anxious to pay, cannot pay this money because it is not safe to pay it. That is the position we have got into owing to the promises of the First Lord of the Treasury not having been carried out. The Government seem to forget that their position is not quite the same as it was before the last General Election. Then they were at the head of a very large majority, and now, apart from the Irish, they are hardly in a majority at all. If they would think rather more of the interests of the country and not quite so much about their own dignity, we should get on rather better than we have done in the past.<lb/>
There is another question to which my noble friend Lord Avebury alluded. Consols are on the down grade. On the average the interest paid by Consols during the last few months has been the highest interest that has been paid for the last thirty years, which means that Consols are at the lowest price reached since 1880. It is the sort of price that Consols fall to when we are threatened with a serious war. I suppose, to quote the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we are face to face with some sort of war, for this is what he said on a public platform&#x2014;
<quote>"We have got to secure the economic independence of tho workmen of this country. You will never do that as long as you have feudalism. You have in this country 2,500 landlords who own two-thirds of the soil. They, by virtue of their ownership, exercise complete sway, control, and power over the livelihood of millions of men, women and children."</quote>
Here a voice cried "Tax them out of existence," to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer replied&#x2014;
<quote>"Well, I have made a start."</quote>
That sort of language, my Lords, coming from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, does more harm than anyone can conceive, and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0332"/>
<col>613</col>
I do hope that the noble Earl who leads the House will be able to give us an assurance that the bigger interests of this country will have the attention of the Government, and chat they will regularise the finances of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01277"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is another matter to which I think we might call attention apart from the question of the inconvenience of the present situation to the mercantile community, and that is that the policy which His Majesty's Government have pursued with regard to this question is directly contrary to what they said was the object of the taxation in the Budget. The desire of the Government was said to be to place taxation on the broad shoulders of those best able to bear it. That was obviously a desire to place taxation on the shoulders of the wealthy classes, and the wealthy classes were hardest hit through the Income Tax. Well, the result of this refusal to collect Income Tax is that the working classes, who pay the greater part of their taxation through the tobacco and liquor duties, have been paying their share of the Budget taxation, whilst the wealthy classes have been practically going exempt through the non-payment of Income Tax. This, I think, is a point the country ought to know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01278"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who asked this Question alluded to a debate which took place on the subject in the other House, but he did not refer to the fact that the whole subject was debated here at considerable length, I think, in his absence, on March 7, on the Treasury (Temporary Borrowing) Bill. I cannot help thinking that that debate has entirely escaped his notice. At any rate I am sure the noble Lord will acquit me of any discourtesy towards him if I do not this afternoon go over all the ground which I then attempted to cover.<lb/>
It will be remembered, to put it briefly, that at that time we explained, not, no doubt, to the satisfaction of noble Lords opposite, but still we explained the reasons why we had not introduced the Budget before the Easter recess. The reasons to the contrary&#x2014;and here, again, I am sure the noble Lord will acquit me of any slighting intention&#x2014;were put with a force which even he with his great experience cannot exceed, by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Revel-stoke, and also by Lord St. Aldwyn, who is

not in his place to-day. The arguments for the immediate introduction of the Budget, for the possible course, which we declined to take, of passing a separate Income Tax Bill before the Dissolution of Parliament, and for introducing an Income Tax Resolution the moment Parliament met&#x2014;all these were stated with the fullest force by noble Lords opposite, and we endeavoured to the best of our ability to explain why we were not in a position and why we did not think it right to take any of those courses. It would serve, I think, no useful purpose if I repeated the arguments I used on that occasion.<lb/>
The noble Lord, however, is entitled to ask why, on the reassembling of Parliament on March 29, the Budget was not immediately proceeded with in another place. The explanations which we gave of the reason for dealing at once with Supply when Parliament met and not then taking the Budget, obviously do not apply to the course which we have taken of proceeding with what are familiarly but inaccurately known as the Veto Resolutions in another place. Before I say a word upon that I should like to refer to a point which was raised in the remarks of Lord Faber. The noble Lord stated the case of a company which had tendered Income Tax, I think, at the end of December, when it was accepted, and which had received in March an intimation that if it liked it might pay Income Tax again, and he pointed out, as an illustration of the confusion caused by the present state of things, that His Majesty's Government could not give a guarantee&#x2014;I am only quoting the noble Lord, because I have no personal knowledge of what occurred&#x2014;that the Income Tax, if paid, would be returned in the event of the Budget not becoming law. I suppose it is open to anybody, if a particular tax is paid and not confirmed by Parliament, to sue for the recovery of that amount; and in previous cases, in the case of 1885, when the Budget did not pass the House of Commons and another Budget had to be brought in&#x2014;in that case my impression is that actual refunds were made. At any rate it was understood that they would be made. What the technical point about an absolute guarantee may be I confess I do not know. I do not understand what material fear such a company could have that if the tax were paid it would not be returned in the event of the Budget not becoming law.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0333"/>
<col>615</col>
I should have thought that the action of this company was from one point of view something of a defence of our action, because the charge which is brought against us is not so much, I think, that we did not immediately proceed with the Budget, but that we did not pass a separate Income Tax Resolution. I do not know whether, if such a Resolution were passed, the noble Lord's company would feel more disposed to pay the Income Tax than they are at present. They would not, so far as I can see, be in any better position than now as regards the repayment of the tax, should the Budget not become law. Not only that, but I have heard it stated that there are a considerable number of persons, representing large sums of money, who would not pay Income Tax now on the strength of a Resolution passed in another place, and for this reason, to be perfectly candid in the matter, that nobody can say at this moment whether the Budget will pass either the House of Commons or the House of Lords. And supposing it should not pass, it is impossible to say what financial arrangements a Government in power at the time might choose to make. Those financial arrangements might conceivably involve a second payment of Income Tax, and I can quite imagine that matters having reached the situation which they have, owing, as we say, to the rejection of the Finance Bill by your Lordships, a mere Resolution of the House of Commons would not be regarded as sufficient for the payment of Income Tax; and, as I have said, I am told that there are a number of persons who will not pay if such a Resolution is passed.<lb/>
The reasons which I gave on the last occasion, and which I do not wish to repeat, for taking Supply instead of the Budget no longer hold good; but what I said on that occasion as regards the political situation still holds good. After all, His Majesty's Ministers may be looked at in two capacities. They are no doubt clerks, if you like so to put it, responsible for the management of the taxpayer's money; but they are also for the time being, as long as they are honoured with the confidence of the Crown and the country, the guardians of the Constitution, and it is conceivable that those two functions may, on a given occasion conflict. We have never concealed from the House&#x2014;in fact, I definitely stated&#x2014;that it is the political situation founded on the action of your
<col>616</col>
Lordships' House which has caused the House of Commons now to insist upon proceeding with this question of the relations between the two Houses before the financial situation is attempted to be regularised. Your Lordships opposite, of course, think that wrong and foolish. But it is the fact. They are determined to deal with the constitutional question, to express their opinion upon your Lordships' rights in dealing with finance, to express their opinion on the general situation as it exists between the two Houses, before they proceed to the consideration of the financial business of the year 1909&#x2013;10.<lb/>
That involves a loss of something over a fortnight of time. I am assuming that we have dealt with the case up to March 29, when the House met. What will happen will be that the Budget will be started in the House of Commons on April 18. I fully admit that the loss of interest on borrowed money accruing to that time is lost for constitutional reasons, and because of the refusal of the House of Commons to deal with finance until it has dealt with the constitutional question. As I pointed out before&#x2014;and I may remind the noble Lord of it as he was not here&#x2014;even if we had taken the advice of noble Lords opposite and resigned office, the case would not have been different, because whoever was in office the House of Commons, constituted as it is, would have refused to take any course but that which it has taken. Therefore, so far as the actual facts of the case are concerned, nothing that we could do, even if we desired to do it, would have altered the situation. In the meantime I understand the general situation to be&#x2014;and we all regret the situation, of course, although we ascribe different causes to its origin&#x2014;that the Treasury will take money which is offered to it, but it does not feel able to ask for money until it knows for certain that it will be authorised by Parliament to keep that money.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl below the Gangway, Lord Denbigh, pointed out that while the poorer classes had been paying indirect taxes, yet the broad shoulders on which it was intended to place the burden had so far gone free. I do not think the noble Earl need be seriously alarmed. It is not anticipated that the loss on arrears will be a heavy one, although, of course, there is bound to be some loss, and I think that the burden will be placed on the broad shoulders quite as soon as the noble
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0334"/>
<col>617</col>
Earl himself could desire. As a matter of fact, a considerable part of the burden, as Lord Faber pointed out, has been paid, because the wealthy individual has paid it and it is now in the hands of the banker, who, I suppose, from one point of view, cannot greatly regret the continuance of the existing state of things, for he has a great deal of money which he is able to advance, I hope on satisfactory terms, to those who require it for short periods of time. I confess I do not think the argument of Lord Denbigh is one which of itself need carry very great weight with your Lordships.<lb/>
There was one more observation made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to which I wish to allude. He said it is not the case that anybody asked us to split up the Budget and bring in a series of Bills. Is that quite accurate? I thought that one of the main charges brought against the Budget and one of the principal reasons adduced for its rejection was that it ought to have appeared in a series of Bills. That is an argument which was freely pressed by many noble Lords on that side of the House, and it certainly offered to us an additional reason, if additional reason were needed, for declining to treat the Income Tax as a thing by itself, because such a course would undoubtedly have seemed to offer some adhesion to the view so freely expressed by noble Lords opposite that the Budget was not a Bill by itself. The noble Lord, I have no doubt, takes the sound view, which was also taken by Lord St. Aldwyn, that in these times there could be no question of bringing in the financial proposals of the year in more than one Bill; but I am not at all sure that noble Lords opposite, taking them altogether, would subscribe to that doctrine. I am strongly of opinion that they would very much like to see the financial proposals of the year split up into several Bills in order that they might deal with each on its merits. However, I do not wish to dwell upon that any further, but merely to say that if I have not argued at length all the reasons which have induced us not to take the course of bringing in the Income Tax Resolution in another place, which the noble Lord seems to consider so easy and reasonable, it is because in the former debate, on March 7, I and noble Lords on this side dealt with them at great length.</membercontribution></p>
<col>618</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01279"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid my noble friends who raised this question cannot feel at all satisfied with the reply which they have received from the noble Earl the Leader of the House. Nothing new has been added in the way of information in reply to the very plain and direct question addressed to the noble Earl. His defence is that he is unwilling to repeat statements which he has already made on a previous occasion. I had not the privilege of hearing that debate, but I understand that the reason why the Government refused to take any special steps for the purpose of collecting the Income Tax was that they could not divide their financial proposals.<lb/>
I presume that the theory of a single indivisible Finance Bill dates back to 1861, but I do not know how far that is supposed to be a precedent for all time. I do not wish to labour too closely questions of precedent, but certainly it has not been invariably adhered to. In consequence of a debate which took place, I think, in the year 1888 a subsequent Bill, originating in Committee of Ways and Means in the House of Commons, was passed; and in 1900, in order to raise money needed for the war, a similar proceeding took place. I admit that there were excellent reasons for the introduction of those separate Bills and that in ordinary circumstances it is convenient that the financial proposals of the Government should be contained in a single Bill each year. It is a matter of convenience and enables them to state their proposals as a whole and to lay them before the country. But at the same time there have been ample precedents for departing from precedent, as when questions of great emergency arose and when it was necessary that definite steps should be taken to raise money.<lb/>
I presume that when the Government state that they will use only one measure in which to lay their financial proposals before the country they mean that they will make only one proposal for bringing money into the Exchequer. But what about the present session? Already there have been two Bills originating in Committee of Ways and Means; there is every prospect of another, which will contain the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10; and of yet another originating in Committee of Ways and Means and constituting the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0335"/>
<col>619</col>
Budget of 1910&#x2013;11. Therefore, in the one year there is a possibility of four different sets of financial proposals for collecting money being placed before Parliament. Certainly if ever there was a departure from the precedent established in 1861 of introducing your financial proposals in one Bill I think we find it in the present year.<lb/>
Large sums of money are lying in the banks to-day for the payment of which into the Exchequer only the authority of Parliament is needed. As far as the transaction to which Lord Faber referred is concerned, I can state one which is identical. There had been some previous correspondence between the Inland Revenue authorities and a certain company. The point in question was whether it would be safe for the company to hand the money over to the Inland Revenue. I believe the reply was couched in such a form that it was felt that there would be the necessary security, and it was only upon subsequent development that the Inland Revenue had to write a letter informing the company in question that that guarantee could not be given. Where that subsequent information was received from, of course we do not know, but the inference we are justified in drawing is that it came from the Chancellor of the Exchequer acting through the Treasury. It would have been perfectly easy, we maintain, to have passed the Income Tax Resolution. There has been ample time, and an undertaking was given by the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses that every facility would be given for its passage.<lb/>
It was no doubt the intention of the Government before the election, probably during the election, and possibly for a few days after they met Parliament, to take steps at once to redeem the very clear and distinct pledge given by the Prime Minister that it would be the first duty of the Government to regularise the collection of taxes. It was only after the somewhat mysterious proceedings which have taken place since the new House of Commons met that the prospects of that pledge being redeemed have been disappearing into the future. As it is understood that we are to continue for some time in this condition, I think, as was suggested by Sir Robert Finlay in the House of Commons, a notice might be put up on the door of the Treasury to the effect that it is a most praiseworthy institution and supported by charitable
<col>620</col>
contributions. By the course which the Government have adopted they have managed to cause the maximum of inconvenience to individuals with the least benefit to the Treasury. And you are now in this peculiar position, that you are having to borrow money in order to refund those abatements which come under the Income Tax laws, and in respect of which you have received no tax at all. If a parish council conducted their affairs in a manner in any degree comparable to that in which the Government are conducting the affairs of the nation, it would have been the duty of the Local Government Board auditor to declare, in the most clear and distinct manner, that they ought to be surcharged and that they were unworthy to carry on the duties entrusted to them.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Leader of the House has informed us that the Budget is to be introduced on April 18. Can he go a step further and tell us whether it is to be the same Budget? He has informed us that nothing can be done to require the collection of these taxes until April 18, when the Budget is to be again introduced into the House of Commons. Is he able to give us any information beyond that and to tell us whether it will come up to this House without the alteration of a comma? If he cannot give any immediate satisfaction as to the collection of the Income Tax, can he say whether the negotiations now going on have reached a point which give a reasonable prospect that the Budget will be passed by the House of Commons? Perhaps he may be in a position to take us a little more into his confidence and tell us whether there is any reasonable prospect that these very heavy arrears of taxes will be collected. I am afraid it is not likely that we shall get much further information, and I say, with all deliberation, that you have produced no arguments, no reasons, for this wilful and wanton abandonment of the collection of money which is properly due to the Treasury. You cannot possibly have done it in the interests of the country. You may think there is some petty advantage to be gained in this great constitutional question in which we are now engaged by the course you have adopted, but I believe you are doomed to disappointment. The real reason for this course is that the Government are making a deliberate attempt to "queer the pitch" for their successors, and to make it as difficult as possible for them to carry on the government of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01280"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RITCHIE OF DUNDEE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think the noble Duke and the noble Lord who initiated this discussion were quite fair to the Prime Minister. They found fault with him for not having kept the undertaking which he gave that the first act of the new Parliament would be, to regularise the financial position of the country. But I think they have both overlooked the qualifying words in the Prime Minister's statement, "if we are fortunate enough to enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons." It is notorious that the Government do not enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons, at any rate as far as their financial policy is concerned. If they did enjoy that confidence, then their first act would have been to regularise the financial situation. They do not enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons, so nothing is done, and the country is plunged into financial chaos. The Government try to smother up the unpleasant fact that they do not enjoy the confidence of the other House by blaming this House for the chaos. No doubt it is rather galling for His Majesty's Ministers to find that owing to the action of this House last session they no longer enjoy the confidence of the House, of Commons, but it appears to me rather unfair to blame this House for giving the people an opportunity of expressing their disapproval of the Budget.<lb/>
I am quite aware that it is said the Irish Party are not really opposed to the Budget; that they only dislike parts of it. I am like the Irish Party. I am not really opposed to the Budget. I only dislike parts of it. Your Lordships are not opposed to the Budget; you only dislike parts of it. One would have thought that the Government would proceed with the parts that everybody likes. But that would not be dignified, and it would amount, so we are told, to a surrender of one of the most cherished privileges of the House of Commons. So the dignity of the Government and the privileges of the House of Commons are costing the country about &#x00A3;20,000 a week, and have led to a deficit of some &#x00A3;26,000,000. Nero fiddled while Rome was burning, and it appears to me there is about as much dignity in the attitude of the Government at the present moment as there was in Nero's fiddling.<lb/>
But what a time for the Government and the House of Commons to stand on their dignity! At this very moment they are engaged in pursuing their unalterable
<col>622</col>
determination to deprive this House of all voice in the financial legislation of the country. Surely on the eve of our doom it would not be a great thing for the House of Commons, of its own free will, to waive one of its privileges in order to save the country from financial chaos. Were it not for the fact that one is more anxious for the good of the State than for Party advantage, the financial antics of the Government would be excessively funny. Only last session a distinguished member of the Government told the capitalist that the time was coming when he would be asked the tremendous question, Where did you get your money? The same Government goes to the capitalists this session, cap in hand, and says to them, "You owe the State a certain sum of money for Income Tax. We won't trouble you to pay it; we merely ask you to lend it to us, and you can settle between yourselves what rate of interest you will charge us. Then we shall both owe one another money, and in the fulness of time we hope we may persuade the people's representatives to swallow the People's Budget and then we will settle it all up." That is better business for the capitalists even than floating rubber companies. There is a certain amount of risk, though not very much, in connection with rubber, but there is no risk in lending the Government money that belongs to the Government; and one of these days, when Mr. Winston Churchill goes to the capitalist and asks him the tremendous question, "Where did you get your money?" he will be told by the capitalist that some of it at any rate he has got through lending money to the Government that was due to the Government and receiving interest on the loan.<lb/>
During the General Election campaign the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Home Secretary&#x2014;I forget which&#x2014;told the country that the Budget was in a state of suspended animation, but that it was destined to a great and glorious resurrection. I suppose the Budget is still languishing in purgatory, and I think it is extremely doubtful whether it will ever emerge; but, if the Government do succeed in galvanising it into life again, I am certain that when it reappears it will not be surrounded by a halo of glory. I am certain, too, that the people will know how to deal with, and what to think of, a Government which have only succeeded in galvanising their Budget into life again by buying the support of those who were returned to Parliament to oppose it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE AND FOREIGN<lb/> SERVICE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01282"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War whether the War Office are able to give any information with regard to Army Form E 624, containing the terms of an agreement seeking to subject officers and men of the Territorial Force to liability to serve in any place outside the United Kingdom in the event of national emergency.<lb/>
I shall not occupy the attention of the House for more than a few moments in calling attention to the terms of this agreement. Certain conditions are attached to the agreement, but the point to which I wish to draw attention is that these conditions and the very nature of the agreement involve a certain amount of pressure, because the Territorial officer or man who signs on for foreign service in time of national emergency is to be awarded a badge, which will, of course, distinguish him from the other officers and men in the regiment. The question has already been mooted of having service squadrons, so to speak, which I feel sure would be extremely unpopular, at any rate in Yeomanry regiments. I have privately tested the opinion of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men with regard to the wearing of these badges and the whole question of voluntary liability for foreign service, and I can assure the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War that if he carries out this agreement and if men are to be awarded badges for saying they will come forward in time of national emergency to serve abroad, it will be an exceedingly unpopular move.<lb/>
I submit, moreover, that it is not neces-
<col>624</col>
sary. If you wish to draw upon your home Army for foreign service, it is hardly necessary to make the arrangements now. Should the emergency arise, all those anxious to serve abroad could easily enlist to do so at the proper time. Is it desirable that you should now call upon the men of a force enlisted for home defence to volunteer for foreign service? Your Territorial Force must be either for home defence or not for home defence. If it is not for home defence, then we had better say so at once. We cannot possibly have it both ways. We ought to tell the nation that, after all, we cannot allocate the force solely to home defence, but are compelled to draw upon it for foreign service. But if the force is for home defence, let us keep it for that purpose. The opinion of the War Minister himself is that 350,000 men will be sufficient for home defence. Others do not think so. But he has not got 350,000 men. He has only got 270,000, and these 270,000 men are to be further drawn upon and to be asked to serve outside the United Kingdom. Some may wish to do so. Others&#x2014;and it would be very hard on those men&#x2014;may be just as patriotic and just as willing to serve abroad, but for private reasons and reasons of necessity may not be able to comply with this agreement. If you do this with your Territorial Army, you are trying to rob Peter to pay Paul, and you will have the appearance of counting your men twice over.<lb/>
I venture to suggest, with great respect, that the Territorial Force at present is not large enough, and that it is very undesirable, not only in the manner in which it is proposed to do it but in any case, to try and suck away from that home defence Army any appreciable number of men for other purposes outside the United Kingdom. Supposing a certain number of officers and men respond to this invitation. how does the noble Lord propose to fill up the gaps? I daresay he will tell us that he has a Reserve for the Territorial Army. I do not propose to enter at length into that question now, because it ought to be a subject for a separate debate, but it is an extremely interesting proposal. I do not know how far it has matured, but one thing about it we do know&#x2014;that according to the terms of the Reserve force the duties of a Territorial Reservist are to be exactly the same as those of a member of the Territorial Force with the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0338"/>
<col>625</col>
exception that he is not to come out to camp and do any training. This seems to me to be rather a formidable differentiation. I beg to put the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01283"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will give the noble Lord the best answer I can to his Question. One is always faced with a certain amount of difficulty in answering an interrogation like this, because both question and answer are hypothetical. To endeavour to give a definite answer as to what will arise when you do not know what the situation is going to be is always difficult, but I think I can explain our general attitude in this matter.<lb/>
As to liability for foreign service, the point which the noble Lord raises now might well have been raised nearly three years ago, at the time when the Territorial Forces Act was passing through this House, because all that the recent Army Order and the form to which the noble Lord calls attention do is simply to put in force what is already in the Act. Section 13 of the Act lays down, after saying that the area and service of the Territorial Force is the United Kingdom, that&#x2014;
<quote>"It shall be lawful for His Majesty to accept the offer of any part of the Territorial Force to subject themselves to liability to serve in any place outside the United Kingdom."</quote>
What we are doing with regard to this is simply putting that section of the Act into force. You have, I agree, to look at the question of how far you can use your Territorial Force for service abroad primarily from the standpoint of the question of home defence. The Territorial Force is primarily a home defence force, and although a certain number of men accept liability to serve abroad I think you have to give the Government of the day, whoever they may be, credit for not employing these men for service abroad if their services are required at home for the purposes of home defence.<lb/>
With the present organisation of the Regular Army, when you have got the Special Reserve to maintain the Expeditionary Force in the field it is very hard to conceive any circumstances in which you would want units, or parts of units, of the Territorial Force to go out to augment your force abroad during the early stages
<col>626</col>
of a war. We have had quoted in this connection the analogy of the volunteer companies which went out in the early period of the South African war. In general organisation we have advanced a good way beyond that stage; and the fact that you have now the Special Reserve and that you have now organised a larger Expeditionary Force makes it difficult to conceive that you could in any circumstances require to augment your Expeditionary Force during the early stages of a campaign. But if we are engaged in a big war, the position at sea as the war goes on is bound to become more defined and our liability to or our security from the possibility of raids or invasions is bound to become clear, and I can quite conceive the position under which, after the war has gone on for some months, the Government of the day should be able to say that our position at sea was sufficiently commanding for them to be able to weaken our home defences in order to augment the military forces abroad. It is to meet that position, which conceivably might arise in the later stages of a war, that we are desirous of having men of the Territorial Force to call upon.<lb/>
In a great national emergency of that kind the strong presumption is, of course, that the Territorial Force would have been embodied at once on the outbreak of the war and would have undergone a long training on embodiment. Therefore these men would have done their training on embodiment before the question arose of sending them abroad. As to the question of weakening the Territorial Force by sending members of it abroad, I do not see, as I have said, how we can send them abroad in the early stages of a war; but during the progress of the war you would have called out your Reservists, the men who were recruits at the time of embodiment would have received several months training, new men would be coming in a number of whom would be ex-Territorials, and I should think it would be pretty certain that all the units of the Territorial Force would be well over establishment and would be able to spare men without weakening themselves below the standard necessary for efficiency.<lb/>
Then as to the position of the man himself who is asked to undertake this obligation. I quite agree with the noble Lord that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0339"/>
<col>627</col>
it is very important to prevent any sort of pressure being put on these men. The noble Lord suggested that you would avoid putting pressure upon them if you waited till the emergency arose and then asked them to volunteer. My opinion is that the pressure which would then be put upon a member of the Territorial Force and the stigma which would attach to him if when a war was going on he refused to serve abroad would be much greater than under our present system, safeguarded by the instructions given to commanding officers that they shall not certify any offer until they have fully explained to the man that the offer is purely voluntary on his part and made quite sure that no pressure of any kind has been put upon him. Then the noble Lord instanced the badge as one means of putting pressure on these men. The badge cuts both ways. In some cases it is quite possible that it may be considered that a man who does not wear a badge is a fit subject for opprobrium; but I know of one regiment in the Territorial Force the members of which are quite willing to come forward and volunteer, but they will not wear the badge. Therefore, if the badge is an unpopular thing in itself, as in some cases it may prove to be, I do not think it is likely to be used as a weapon against the man who does not undertake this liability.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01284"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think your Lordships can have been taken in by what seemed to me the rather sorry subterfuge to which the noble Lord resorted. The noble Lord said that the War Office were merely putting the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act into force, but as I understand the Act that is not the case. As I read that Act, it merely says that it does not forbid a man to serve abroad if he pleases. That is a purely negative provision and demands no present action. That is the sense in which everybody understood it when the Act was passed, and I do not think the noble Lord has any right to say that this complaint should have been raised at that time. If anyone had a notion that those words would have been used in this way, there would have been a good deal of protest. The action now being taken by the War Office amounts to a direct invitation to the men to engage in advance for foreign service. That is entirely different from saying that the King, in spite of anything in the Act, may accept the services of those who choose to volunteer when an emergency has actually arisen.</membercontribution></p>
<col>628</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01285"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is very encouraging to hear the optimistic view of the noble Lord as to the military potentialities of the future. Everything is perfectly admirable&#x2014;on paper. He tells us that there is an admirable force, but it is a force on paper, and that there is an admirable force of Reserves, also on paper. I have only risen for the purpose of suggesting that it would be much better for the War Office to concentrate their efforts upon filling up the ranks of the Territorial Force before embarking on distinctions of this kind. The noble Lord assumes that there will be an unlimited number of trained soldiers in this country who would be prepared to go anywhere should an emergency arise. That may possibly be the case. But we have to look at the facts, and to realise that the Territorial Force from whom all these things are expected is at this moment 30,000 or 40,000 below its establishment; and I venture to suggest that the most practical thing to do would be to fill up the force to its proper figure before making these distinctions between the classes of men who form it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IMPORT DUTIES AND OLD AGE PENSIONS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01319"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government (1) whether New Zealand and Australia levy a tax on imported articles; and what proportion of
<col>632</col>
their revenue is derived from this source; and (2) whether these countries provide old age pensions on a non-contributory basis; and, if so, at what rate per week, and commencing at what age.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01320"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first Question is that both the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth of Australia levy duties on imported articles. For the last three years for which information is available&#x2014;1906, 1907, and 1908&#x2014;the annual revenue of New Zealand, exclusive of certain sums collected by the Dominion for local authorities, averaged &#x00A3;8, 826,000, of which &#x00A3;2,949,000, or 33&#x00B7;4 per cent., was derived from import duties; while the annual revenue of Australia, including both the Commonwealth and States revenue, averaged &#x00A3;38,485,000, of which &#x00A3;7,997,000, or 20&#x00B7;8 per cent., was derived from import duties.<lb/>
In answer to the second Question, both of these countries grant pensions on a non-contributory basis. The conditions vary slightly. In New Zealand pensions are given at the age of sixty-five years. The maximum pension is &#x00A3;26 per annum, or 10<i>s</i>. a week. The conditions under which that pension is given are that &#x00A3;1 is deducted from the amount of the pension for every &#x00A3;1 of income possessed by the pensioner, and &#x00A3;1 is deducted also in respect of every &#x00A3;10 of capital or capital property which he possesses, with the exception that if his property consists in part of the house in which he lives that is not taken into account if it is of less value than &#x00A3;150. In the Commonwealth of Australia also the age for pensions is sixty-five years; but in cases of total incapacity for work pensions begin at the age of sixty years. The maximum pension again is &#x00A3;26 per annum. The actual rate of pension is in the discretion of the Commissioners; but it shall not be such that a pensioner's total annual income, including his private means, shall exceed the sum of &#x00A3;52. In Australia, as in New Zealand, &#x00A3;1 is deducted for every &#x00A3;10 capital which a pensioner possesses, except when that capital consists partly of the house in which he lives, in which case deductions begin at &#x00A3;100 instead of &#x00A3;150. The general conditions are substantially the same in the Commonwealth as they are in New Zealand. The only difference is that while in both countries certain sentences dis-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0342"/>
<col>633</col>
qualify a man from receiving a pension, in the Commonwealth of Australia there is an additional disqualification if a man has deserted his wife, or neglected to maintain his children under fourteen years of age.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01321"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: Arising out of those answers I have to ask the noble Lord a yet further question&#x2014;namely, whether His Majesty's Government are still of opinion that a tax on goods imported into this country could not also pay for old age pensions on the very much lower scale here in force, and, if so, what are the reasons, in view of the facts he has just cited, which cause His Majesty's Government to hold that view? May I refer the noble Lord to what was said by the Prime Minister in another place. Referring to the statements of the Lord Advocate, the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"Taking the food taxes as ruled out, taking raw material as ruled out, reducing, as he has reduced, the taxation on imported goods to its proper proportions, the Lord Advocate expressed the opinion, and I think a very well-founded opinion, that Tariff Reform would not meet the expenditure for old age pensions."</quote>
I know that it is often said that it is impossible to institute a comparison between young countries and old, but it is difficult to see how this can affect this particular question.<lb/>
Your Lordships will, I think, agree that people grow old in very much the same way in the Dominion and the Commonwealth as they do in this country, and the noble Lord will not, I think, deny that their death rates compare not a little favourably with our own, the figures for 1906 being 9&#x00B7;31 and 10&#x00B7;85 per thousand for New Zealand and Australia respectively as against 15&#x00B7;4 for the United Kingdom. The noble Lord may, however, say that the imports into New Zealand at any rate are of higher value per head of population than they are in our own. That, my Lords, would, I think, be an explanation that would not be unwelcome to Tariff Reformers in this House, as showing that His Majesty's Government no longer feel that a system of tariffs even as high as that in force in the Dominion tends to cause serious injury to the oversea trade of the country immediately concerned. Perhaps this House may be told that the Lord Advocate was not aware that New Zealand and Australia were actually paying old age pensions on a scale considerably higher than our own, and that therefore
<col>634</col>
his statements were terminological inexactitudes, or, if I may use a less cumbrous phrase, Ure-isms. Might I suggest that the Lord Advocate's office in this case may speedily be enlarged from the travelling despatch box of which for some weeks it appears to have consisted in order that it may contain such valuable books of reference as the New Zealand and Australian year books.<lb/>
The noble Lord may, however, say that I have forgotten the qualifications mentioned by the Prime Minister in the quotation which I have read. I think it is in the recollection of your Lordships that these statements were constantly made without any qualification whatever, and as a matter of fact they do not affect the issue. The revenue derived from food and raw material is but a very small proportion of the whole, as many of these classes of articles are imported free of duty and for the greater part are produced in New Zealand and Australia themselves. If it is said that the tax on imported articles in New Zealand and Australia is a high one, whereas that proposed by Tariff Reformers in this country is considerably lower, it is obvious that His Majesty's Government are of opinion that even a high tax, so far from reducing imports to vanishing point, will bring in a considerable revenue from this source. In view of the facts given to the House by the noble Lord, that New Zealand and Australia do levy a tax on imports and that these countries are enabled, nevertheless, to pay for old age pensions on a non-contributory basis at a rate, not of 5<i>s</i>., but of 10<i>s</i>. per week, and at ages commencing, not at seventy, but at sixty-five, and in special cases younger still, I have to ask whether it is still the opinion of His Majesty's Government that Tariff Reform would be unable to meet the expenditure for old age pensions in this country, and, if so, what are the causes they adduce for such an opinion bearing in mind the facts the noble Lord has just given to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01322"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: I can only reply to the noble Earl by your Lordships' leave, because having already spoken on this question it is clearly out of order for me to speak again. I think that the same remark applies to the speech which the noble Earl has just delivered. Though your Lordships allow considerable latitude in the putting of Questions in this
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0343"/>
<col>635</col>
House I do not think it is customary to ask a Question and, having obtained an answer, then to make a speech, for the reason I have stated. I would suggest that if the noble Earl wishes to raise that point he should put another Question upon the Order Paper, or give notice of a Motion. I might say generally, as to the reason for pensions being on a higher scale in Australia and New Zealand than they are in this country, that the cost of living is considerably higher there than it is here, and that a sum which would be an adequate pension in this country would be altogether inadequate in that part of the world.</membercontribution></p>

<title>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES&#x2014;<lb/> GOVERNMENTS RESOLUTIONS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01343"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will your Lordships allow me, in the absence of my noble friend Lord Lansdowne, who is confined to his house with a slight cold, to put a question of some importance to His Majesty's Government. It has reference to the course of procedure as to what are called the Veto Resolutions which have been under discussion for some time in another place. That discussion is, naturally enough, of some interest to your Lordships; and we should like, as the time seems to be getting close, to be taken, to this extent at any rate, into the confidence of His Majesty's Government that they should inform us when these important matters are to be submitted to us for discussion. I should like to add a further question. In what shape are these Resolutions&#x2014;which we understand are to be finally disposed of by the House of Commons on Thursday&#x2014;to be submitted to your Lordships' House? Are they to be similar Resolutions to those of which we have heard through the usual channels, similar, that is, to those now under discussion in the House of Commons; and, further, when is it the intention of His Majesty's Government that these matters shall be considered by this House? For example, does the noble Earl propose that we shall deal with them before the Spring Recess, which has been for so long a time promised to us? I should like to ask also whether there is
<col>638</col>
to be a Bill accompanying the Resolutions. There was some indication&#x2014;I am not sure whether an indication on the part of His Majesty's Government or merely the subject of a rumour outside&#x2014;that the Resolutions in the House of Commons would lead up to a Bill. Will the Bill be printed at once? Will it be introduced into Parliament, and, if so, might I ask in which House it is likely to be introduced? If it is not introduced in your Lordships House, will it at any rate be available for your Lordships to see what are the detailed intentions of His Majesty's Government with reference to these important matters? And if the Bill is not to be introduced into this House and not to be put in hand, when is it to be in our hands, and when are we to have the full mind of His Majesty's Government as to the constitutional position of your Lordships' House? I think your Lordships will feel that it is not too early very respectfully to put these questions as to procedure to the Government, considering how vitally interested your Lordships' House is in the answers which His Majesty's Government might give.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01344"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must first say for myself, and on behalf of my noble friends behind me, that we greatly regret the reason which prevents the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition from being in his place to put these questions. But as the questions have been put by the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, I will endeavour to answer them as best I can, although unfortunately I am not in possession of all the <i>data</i> which would enable me to give a full answer as to the future course of business. The Resolutions of which the noble Marquess spoke should reach their conclusion in the House of Commons in the course of the present week, and it is proposed in another place, as I understand, to proceed next week with the Finance Bill. Clearly it would be possible for us, therefore, to proceed at once with the discussion here of those Resolutions; but I am obliged in turn to put a question to the noble Marquess and his friends opposite, because I do not know what in their view would be a proper interval before the discussion should proceed. We are naturally anxious that no undue delay should take place in the discussion of this supremely important question; but at the same time, of course,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0345"/>
<col>639</col>
we recognise that noble Lords opposite are not only entitled to an opinion as to what delay, in their judgment, should intervene before the Resolutions are taken here, but they are also in a position at any rate to a great extent, to enforce their opinion. Perhaps I might say that I think it would be generally agreed by noble Lords opposite that it would be desirable that the Finance Bill should not be delayed longer than can be helped, and that it certainly would be desirable&#x2014;I gather that from the speeches which noble Lords have made on the subject of finance during the current session&#x2014;that the Finance Bill should be passed into law before there is any question of adjournment for the Spring Recess. But there are various other questions involved. I do not know what is the opinion of noble Lords opposite and of the majority of the House as to the time when it would be desirable to proceed with the discussion of the further Resolutions of my noble friend Lord Rosebery, who is not in his place to-day; and in those circumstances it is difficult for me to suggest any date for the discussion of the House of Commons Resolutions. I may say this, that we propose to introduce to your Lordships' House the same Resolutions as are now passing through discussion in another place. My right hon. friend the Prime Minister has stated that they will in due course, be followed by a Bill, and that there will be no undue delay in the production of that Bill; but I am not in a position to tell noble Lords opposite the precise date on which that Bill will be laid on the Table. I am afraid that is all the information which I am able to give, and I am conscious that I have been rather asking for information than giving it, because, to some extent, without the <i>data</i> which I have mentioned, particularly with reference to the discussion of my noble friend's Resolutions, it is exceedingly difficult to indicate the date upon which the Government Resolutions should be put down in this House. I do not know whether it is possible without some consultation, particularly in the absence of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, for noble Lords opposite to give any information on the points which I have mentioned; but if they are not able to do so now, perhaps in the course of the present week they may be able to arrive at some matured opinion as to what they think the course of business should be.</membercontribution></p>
<col>640</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01345"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is really difficult for anybody on this side of the House particularly in the absence of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, to make a definite reply to the questions of the noble Earl. In the first place he is anxious to know what will be done in regard to the further Resolutions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery. I am afraid he must ask the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. I am not able to give any information on that point. I understand that the noble Earl himself is going to introduce Resolutions in your Lordships' House similar to those which by that time will have been passed through the other place, and that they are to be followed by a Bill; but the noble Earl did not tell us whether the Bill is to be introduced in the first instance in this House or in another place. I think that is an important consideration which your Lordships ought to have in your minds before you come to any decision as to the course which you ought to take. With respect to the interval of time which should take place before the discussion after the Resolutions have been placed on the Table of your Lordships' House, I think that is a matter which we should like to consider when we have the Resolutions definitely before us.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01353">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Amendment which I have to submit to your Lordships is one which I think can be very shortly explained. Under the existing law the private soldier has a singular privilege in the case of proceedings instituted against him in the ordinary
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0346"/>
<col>641</col>
magisterial Courts for the purpose of enforcing payment for the maintenance of his wife or child. The privilege consists in this, that the wife cannot bring her husband before the Bench until she has forwarded to the commanding officer conduct money sufficient to enable the soldier to attend the hearing of the case and return to his quarters. Similarly, conduct money is required in what is no doubt, the more frequent case, where a single woman claims that a soldier is the father of her child and wishes to obtain through the Court an allowance for the maintenance of the child. This is a privilege entirely confined to the soldier; if a similar proceeding were instituted by the wife of an artisan or by a single woman against an agricultural labourer, the artisan or agricultural labourer would have to appear in the ordinary fashion to answer the complaint. The soldier has another peculiar privilege. It is that the amount which can be recovered from him under a magistrate's order is strictly limited. Why that should be I do not know. I should have thought that the discretion of the magistrate could be allowed to be exercised in such a case in the same way as in an ordinary claim. But I do not now wish to refer to that particular privilege.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01354">The provision in subsection (3) of Section 145, to which I have referred, obviously places a serious difficulty in the way of the prosecution of claims. It is designed, no doubt, to prevent claims being easily brought, but I do not see why such a special privilege should be given to the soldier above every other class. I have known cases brought before me where the woman has had to provide as much as &#x00A3;2, and unless that sum was forthcoming she could do nothing. It is obvious that women in the position of those to whom this subsection refers have not the money necessary to make a claim. In fact, recourse has been had to assistance in order to set going the ordinary procedure of justice. The Society for the Protection of Women and Children has been frequently called upon for assistance in this direction, and were it not for the charity afforded by such an organisation the initial proceeding in the course of justice would be defeated. Moreover, unless special directions are given the money is not ordered to be returned, and in cases in which this Society has advanced money to women who have
<col>642</col>
established their claims and obtained maintenance orders no order has been made for refund. This singular immunity often works to prevent justice being sought and therefore to prevent justice being obtained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01355">I am afraid that my noble friend the Under-Secretary of State for War is not ready to assent to my Amendment. The Amendment safeguards every necessity for military service and could be strengthened if thought desirable. But I am afraid the Government are altogether opposed to its acceptance, and I shall listen with some curiosity to know what excuse can be advanced, except, perhaps, the ordinary one that on the whole not much injustice has been done, that the thing has worked well, and that it is a troublesome matter to alter a regulation which is of some antiquity. I have had to make excuses of that kind in past years, but I have always felt rather ashamed of them as being unfit to be submitted to any tribunal, and I sympathise with my noble friend if that is the kind of excuse he has to make to-day. It does not amount to any reason whatever why this privilege should be maintained&#x2014;a privilege which, as I have said, prevents justice being obtained and makes the claim to an ordinary right dependent upon charity. I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01356">Amendment moved&#x2014;</p>

<quote>. Subsection (3) of section one hundred and forty-five, which relates to the liability of a soldier to maintain his wife and children, shall be repealed, except so far as it deals with the invalidity of processes served on soldiers who are under orders for service beyond the seas.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Courtney of Penwith</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01358"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Amendment which my noble friend has moved would affect the two cases where the wife is suing the soldier for maintenance and also where the soldier is being sued as the putative father of an illegitimate child. As a matter of fact, the cases that arise under this section of the Act are practically confined to the latter category. There is a subsection which enables the wife of a soldier to appeal to the Army Council, or, as a matter of practice, to write to the commanding officer and state her case, and the Army Council then has power to order the soldier to maintain his wife and children; so that for the purpose of the discussion of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0347"/>
<col>643</col>
this particular point it is practically confined to those cases where the soldier is being sued as being the putative father of an illegitimate child.<lb/>
These cases as a rule arise after a regiment has changed its station, the claims being brought against soldiers of the regiment that has left. It has been our experience in the past that the soldier requires some sort of safeguard against claims of this sort. It is often considered that a soldier is fair game for any charge of this kind, and it has been found, as a matter of fact, that the procedure in this section does act in the way of safeguarding the soldier. The soldier is placed in an unfortunate position if he finds himself summoned to a Court at the other end of the country. Soldiers have very little pocket money, and the particular man might have no funds to enable him to travel, and there is always the possibility that simply because he has not got the money necessary to go and defend himself the case may go against him by default. Therefore the primary object of requiring this payment to be made is to enable the soldier to appear and to defend himself if necessary.<lb/>
My noble friend said that it is not usual for this money to be refunded. As a matter of fact it is, I think, the universal rule that if the case goes against the soldier he has, besides being compelled to maintain the infant, to refund the money which was paid in the first instance by the woman. It may be said that the present procedure is one-sided. On the other hand, there are certain safeguards from the woman's point of view in the case of the soldier which do not exist in the case of the ordinary civilian. She has far less difficulty in serving the process because it is served on the man's commanding officer in the first instance; and, secondly, if the Court decide that he shall have to maintain the child the money is recoverable through his commanding officer in the same way. So that in both directions there is a substantial safeguard from the woman's point of view.<lb/>
I am afraid we are not prepared to accept my noble friend's Amendment, at any rate without a good deal of further consideration. So far as we have known, the thing has worked very fairly. We have had no complaints of any sort or kind against this procedure for the last eighteen
<col>644</col>
years. In 1892 the question was raised by a magistrate's clerk, but since then we have heard nothing more about it. While we are perfectly prepared to consider any individual case of hardship that may arise we do attach some importance to giving the soldier some fair and legitimate safeguard. But if my noble friend likes to bring before us the experience of the society to which he referred we would be very glad to consider it, not this year but before the Army (Annual) Bill is brought in next year. I am afraid I cannot hold out anything more than that to my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01359"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot say that I expected my noble friend to accede to my Amendment at once. Therefore I am not very much disappointed at the official answer he has given, and I thank him for the assurance that he will consider any information brought before him with a view to a future amendment of the law. The noble Lord was, I think, under a misapprehension as to this money being refunded in all cases when the claims were established. Two cases were stated to me this morning where the society to which I have referred had advanced the necessary money but no order was made except the orders for weekly payments by the men against whom the claims had been so established. Therefore the out-of-pocket expenses never came back.</membercontribution></p>

But information on this point shall certainly be forwarded to the War Office, and I hope that next year it will be unnecessary for me to move a similar Amendment owing to its having been introduced before the next Army (Annual) Bill is submitted to Parliament.

<title>DIRIGIBLES AND AEROPLANES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01377"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government how many (1) dirigibles, and (2) aeroplanes designed for naval or military service are available now, and how many will be available in twelve months time. Since I raised a discussion of this subject about a year ago the matter has become of more importance. The question of aviation as regards our national defence has been for some time a source of anxiety to those who are aware of what foreign Powers are doing. Some interest in the matter has been manifested by Members of the House of Commons, notably by the formation of an Aviation Committee and by the purchase, in combination with other people, of an airship with which they hope to demonstrate to the Government and to the public the possibilities of such machines. At present I do not think that the Government fully appreciate the growing importance of the subject, and I hope to-day to ascertain that Ministers are more alive than the public imagine to the importance of preparing in tune for this new development.<lb/>
Within the last year a very notable advance has been made in the various devices
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0349"/>
<col>647</col>
for carrying on warfare in the air. The dirigible balloon is at present the chief weapon of offence. All the Continental nations who claim to be in the forefront in this matter&#x2014;Germany, France, and Austria&#x2014;have, so far, applied themselves mainly to the construction of dirigibles, and to my mind it appears rather a startling situation that Germany&#x2014;with whom I am glad to know that we are on terms of complete friendship at present&#x2014;is in the position of entire mistress of the air in the same way as this country in times past claimed to be mistress of the sea. Germany has sufficient dirigibles to meet those of all other Powers, and probably to vanquish them, should war ever occur. At present the use of airships in warfare will be auxiliary to the main purposes of an army. Their chief use, I consider, will be to ascertain the position of the enemy by means not hitherto available; but it must be remembered that in some cases preparations have already been made whereby dirigibles hovering over a city or an army which it is desired to attack could pour out explosives, and thus wreck lines of communication, paralyse the nerve centres of cities, and create, as they would tend to do, panic in the army subject to attack by these new weapons.<lb/>
I am not satisfied from the information which I have been able to gather that His Majesty's Government are making adequate preparations or considering seriously enough this new position of affairs. Since this time last year the use of the dirigible has become recognised as not only possible but inevitable in a great war. Germany and France would not have spent so much money as they have done on the construction of dirigibles had not that been regarded as certain by the great military authorities of those countries. Last year the greatest number of men which any dirigible in the world could carry was carried by a dirigible of the Zeppelin type in Germany, which it was claimed could carry fourteen men. The most recent type of those machines is over 450 feet long, with a diameter of 40 feet, and can carry as many as thirty-four men. If it is assumed that four or eight men are sufficient to form the crew of such a vessel, the balance of weight between that number of men and thirty-four men could be carried as a cargo of explosives from one ton upwards in weight. In France and Germany a gun or tube has been designed, with air
<col>648</col>
pressure behind it, which I am credibly informed enables a projectile dropped from a height to be so accurately directed that the spot upon which it would fall on the earth's surface could be calculated within fifty yards; in other words, a dirigible hovering over the Palace of Westminster could hit either the House of Lords or the House of Commons with unerring accuracy. That shows to what extent progress has been made.<lb/>
At present this country possesses only a handy little machine, appropriately christened "Baby II," which may be of some use for reconnaissance work, but is not comparable in any way to the great airships possessed by Germany and France. We might as well build a model Dreadnought for sailing on the Serpentine and expect it to be of any use as a real Dreadnought on the high seas. While I wish to give every credit to the gallant officer in charge of ballooning operations at Aldershot, who with very inadequate means has done the best that he possibly could, and in spite of official discouragement has been able to achieve a great deal, I think that the Government must make up their minds that more attention must be devoted to the subject and more money provided in the Army Estimates in future for this branch of the service.<lb/>
I would like to give the House some idea of how this science of warfare has advanced within the last year or so. In regard to dirigibles, the length has grown from 300 feet to 450 feet, their carrying capacity from fourteen to thirty-four men, their speed has increased from twenty miles to forty miles an hour, and the cost of a first-class airship in Germany has increased from about &#x00A3;10,000 to something like &#x00A3;24,000. I do not think that even that cost ought to be prohibitive, for I do not suppose that there is any warship afloat, not even a submarine, which cost less than that amount. So much for dirigibles. The advance has been even more striking in regard to aeroplanes, which will be another weapon to be used besides dirigibles. Aeroplanes will be of great use in gaining information, and will be able to go out in weather which dirigibles could not withstand. The height attained in the flight of an aeroplane is now 984 feet, the speed has increased from just over thirty miles to forty-eight miles an hour, the greatest distance flown has increased from seventy-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0350"/>
<col>649</col>
two miles to 145 miles without touching the earth, and the longest time that an aeroplane has remained in the air has increased from two hours to four hours seventeen minutes.<lb/>
What is wanted in this country is more concentrated attention upon the problem of aviation, and it is open to question whether a mixed naval and military authority with the addition of some members outside the Services should not he formed to press forward the subject and to advise the Government as to the latest developments. I agree that dirigibles are of very little use without sheds to accommodate them. The German Government have a great number of airship-sheds either constructed or under construction; so that it is evident that the German military authorities have given every attention to this matter.<lb/>
As to the probable number of airships in 1911, so far as I have been able to ascertain, this country will have not more than five dirigibles privately owned and publicly owned, including the airship which may or may not come over from France next week. That is a smaller number than any first-class Power in Europe will have, with the single exception of Spain. In 1911 I calculate that France will have at least ten dirigible fighting machines, Germany twenty-five publicly owned or publicly subsidised, and about nine more privately owned; Austria six or seven, Italy six, Russia five, and Belgium two. Japan, and even China, are taking up the subject. I am not going to suggest that we need be afraid of Japanese or Chinese dirigible balloons. But while all other great nations are taking this question up very seriously and realising what it may mean in the next great war, we are rather at the present moment adopting the attitude of folding our hands and waiting to see what other people do and hoping that we will come out allright in the end. I know that is the historic attitude of this country in most matters. It was so in the case of motor-cars and the telephone, but in both of those matters the safety of the country was not jeopardised, whereas the introduction of the dirigible as a practical machine does introduce new problems in war and may seriously affect at the outset of a great campaign the fortunes of that war.<lb/>
<col>650</col>
The right hon. gentleman the Secretary of State for War in another place spoke, I was delighted to see, with much more than the usual interest about the whole question of military aviation, and I notice in the Estimates that more money is to be devoted to it. I do not think, however, that the money to be devoted to aviation is anything like adequate if we are to protect ourselves against this new form of weapon in the hands of an enemy. I do not believe for a moment in the theory of artillerists that guns can be constructed capable not only of shooting at but of following these machines. That contention is not tenable for a moment. I know that guns are being constructed which can shoot vertically, but it would be impossible to follow a moving airship with a gun mounted on ever so good and speedy a motor-car. A mot or-car travelling at forty miles an hour with a gun in it would not only be an unsafe vehicle, but I should greatly doubt the ability of a gunner to fire in the air with any accuracy after a few miles in a car travelling at a high speed. The captain of the dirigible, on the other hand, would obviously take a line across country, which would make it extremely difficult if not impossible for the car to follow. Therefore the motor-car, however good, and the gun, however good, would be useless.<lb/>
There is only one way of meeting an attack by dirigibles and aeroplanes and that is by meeting like with like. Krupps are now making four kinds of guns for the purpose of shooting at dirigibles, but the German authorities admit that these are only to be used in cases where they can be planted outside a fort or town, and in that way used against attack. It would be impossible to follow dirigibles or aeroplanes by means of moving artillery, and if the Government have any such view I venture to say it should be at once dismissed. Looking to the future, it seems to me that what is wanted is co-operation between patriotically-minded civilians in this country and the Government on this question. There are already some ten or twelve Englishmen who can fly in an aeroplane. There are a great many other Englishmen who have been in dirigibles and have put up a great deal of money to promote this science. There are two great newspapers which have helped in it. There are also the members of the Aviation Committee of the House of Commons, who
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0351"/>
<col>651</col>
have devoted their time and attention and money to this subject. I do not say that this question should be referred to a Royal Commission, for that is a convenient way of shelving a question which is somewhat difficult; but I do think the Government ought to have a most careful inquiry made into the whole position which foreign Powers occupy in this matter. Pains should be taken to ascertain the aerial strength of those Powers, and we should realise that the time has come when we must tackle this question seriously. We must construct a fleet at least equal to that of any other Power, and to do that I think the Government would be wise to institute some kind of Advisory Committee, or consult a certain number of civilians interested in the subject, and in that way elicit valuable support. I hope that the noble Lord the Under-Secretary for War will be able to give some assurance on these points. The more one studies this the more convinced one is of the seriousness of our position to-day, and there is no question that it would be too late if we waited until war broke out before starting to construct. The present is the time for taking action, and I hope that His Majesty's Government will give the matter the attention it deserves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01378"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I fully realise that there is no person in this country who is more entitled to receive the fullest explanation and assurances that the Government can give than the noble Lord who has asked this question, because nobody has identified himself so much with this subject or thrown so much energy into it as he has done, and if I have to differ from him on any point I can assure him that I differ from such an authority with the greatest reluctance. The noble Lord dwelt on the position which foreign Powers occupy and the number of airships they possess at the present time, and he went on to discuss what might be the result should these ships ever be used for purposes of war. He described them as weapons of offence, and compared what we have done up to now in building small airships with the building of miniature Dreadnoughts. With great deference to the noble Lord's knowledge on this matter, I would suggest that he would be a very bold man at the present stage who would compare an airship to a Dreadnought, and there are a great many people who will
<col>652</col>
even deny to a dirigible balloon or aeroplane, or, in fact, any machine that travels through the air, in its present stage of development the title to be considered a weapon of offence. But, at any rate, I think my noble friend will agree with me that all these things are very much in their infancy. It is doubtful how far they could be used under absolutely warlike conditions, and we and all other countries who are dealing with this question are simply experimenting at the present time.<lb/>
We are by no means unaware of the importance of the question or of what is being done in other countries. At the same time, we do feel that it is quite possible that, in studying as we are doing all the great and complicated scientific problems wound up in this question and trying to provide solutions for them, we may be making just as much progress as the countries which are spending a great deal of money experimenting on a large scale. The noble Lord spoke of the necessity of having a carefully prepared scheme. As he knows, the matter was considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence last year, and we are now carrying out their recommendations. The Navy take over the provision of the type of airship known as the rigid, whereas the War Office are going to deal with the non-rigid dirigible, which is a type of machine altogether more suited for land conditions; and for the present we are not dealing with the question of aeroplanes at all. I will explain why we have taken up that line.<lb/>
As we know, aeroplanes are machines which are used by private individuals. Great progress has been made with them by private individuals working on their own, and it is quite conceivable that in a short time we may all of us have our own aeroplanes. An aeroplane is a convenient and handy machine, but the same cannot be said about a dirigible. I do not look forward to any time when we shall have our own private dirigibles. They may become public conveyances or something of that sort, but there is not the scope for private enterprise in the matter of dirigibles that there is in that of aeroplanes, and one cannot help feeling that a Government Department is the worst-organised thing in the world for conducting experiments on the lines on which private individuals are working. It is rather like using a steam hammer to break an egg. Far the best results would probably be achieved in the long
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0352"/>
<col>653</col>
run if we watch what these very enterprising private individuals are doing and take advantage of the results. That, of course, we cannot do in the case of dirigibles, and we are, I will not say developing a programme of dirigibles because they are in an experimental stage at the present time, but the experimental stage cannot be carried on without having a certain number of airships to experiment with.<lb/>
In answer to the immediate question which the noble Lord asks, I can tell him what our fleet of airships will probably be next year. There is being constructed for the Navy one of these large rigid dirigibles, and that, and possibly a second, may be available during the next twelve months. With regard to what we have in the way of non-rigid dirigibles for Army purposes, there is the airship which the noble Lord has referred to as "Baby II," and there is the new one the construction of which has been commenced and which ought to be ready in the next twelve months. Then there are the two foreign airships which are coming over&#x2014;the "Lebaudy" and the "Cl&#x00E9;ment-Bayard," the one which is coming over as the result of the action of the <i>Morning Post</i> and the other which is coming over as the result of the action of the Parliamentary Committee. Both these airships will be tested when they get here, and we understand that through the patriotic efforts of the <i>Morning Post</i> if the "Lebaudy" satisfies that test it will be purchased by them and presented to the War Office. We shall be prepared, if tests, price, and other conditions are satisfactory, to do the same with the "Cl&#x00E9;ment-Bayard." Therefore, supposing both of these come into our possession in that way we ought to have in twelve months four Army dirigibles, though that is nothing like the number of airships possessed by other countries.<lb/>
<col>654</col>
We are following out our policy of watching very carefully, of experimenting, and of trying to advance the general theory as much as possible. In this connection the noble Lord probably knows that we have appointed an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics which has upon it as members some of the leading scientists in the country, who are doing excellent service in working out the complex problems which at present, I will not say stand in the way of success, but constitute one of the chief difficulties with regard to this question. Then, of course, we have our balloon factory at Aldershot, which is under the superintendence of one of the most experienced engineers in the country, Mr. Mervyn O'Gorman, and we have the balloon school under the man who has done so much for us in this connection, Colonel Capper. We are spending considerably more this year than we were before. I understand that the Navy is spending &#x00A3;35,000 in this year's Estimates, and the Army is spending &#x00A3;71,000, a total of &#x00A3;106,000. That compares extremely favourably with the expenditure of public money by other countries, as far as we know. Although it is quite true, as the noble Lord said, that we have not got and are not proposing immediately to provide a large fleet of dirigibles and aeroplanes, I can assure him that we are not simply doing nothing, but that we are working very hard along carefully thought-out and, I think, practical lines; and that we are only waiting before developing the policy along bigger lines for the time when the science of aviation shall have reached a point at which we can definitely say that dirigibles, aeroplanes, flying machines, and so on are of real practical use for military service.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SMALL HOLDINGS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01391"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether it has been finally decided that Mr. Clark, whose farm at Welwick was taken for small holdings, is not to receive compensation for disturbance out of the Small Holdings Fund; and whether they intend to bring in a Bill to prevent similar cases of hardship in the future.<lb/>
I must apologise to your Lordships for bringing this question before the House again, but unfortunately it is one that has not yet been settled. I may, perhaps, very briefly remind your Lordships of what happened, for I think it is rather a typical and not an isolated case. This farm was Crown property, and the whole of it was taken away from the tenant, who, it is true, held other land, but the question is whether he was entitled to receive any compensation for disturbance. My noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture expressed great sympathy, as he always does with any person who suffers hardship, and he hoped that it would be possible to give some compensation to Mr. Clark for being dispossessed of his holding. I suppose that after careful examination on the part of the Law Officers of the Crown and other Government Departments it was found that there was no power to give any compensation to this dispossessed tenant, and as far as I know he has not received, from Government sources at any rate, any compensation.<lb/>
I received only a day or two ago a cutting from the <i>Yorkshire Herald</i> in which the following passage occurs&#x2014;
<quote>"We are informed that the President of the Board of Agriculture gave Mr. Clark &#x00A3;50 out of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0354"/>
<col>657</col>
his own pocket, with an expression in something like these terms: 'For God's sake don't let us hear any more about this Welwick business!'"</quote>
That may or may not be correct, but from what I know of the noble Earl I strongly suspect that it is absolutely true. It is just the sort of kind, good-natured thing the noble Earl would do; but in the words of the French officer at the charge of Balaklava&#x2014;<i>C'est magnifique mais ce n'est pas la guerre</i>. What we desire is that when persons are dispossessed of their holdings in this way they shall be entitled to receive compensation out of Government funds, and not be dependent on the generosity of the holder for the time being of the office of President of the Board of Agriculture.<lb/>
I understand that the Prime Minister has given an undertaking that a measure to make some provision to meet these cases will be introduced, provided he can be satisfied that it will be treated as non-controversial. An association with which I am connected, the Central Land Association, passed a resolution yesterday, which has been forwarded to the Prime Minister, assuring him that so far as they are concerned&#x2014;and there are 104 Members of the other House of Parliament connected with the association, of whom eight Unionist and nine Liberal Members are upon the Committee&#x2014;they will make every effort to secure that if the measure is introduced it shall be treated as non-controversial. In those circumstances I very much hope that we may learn from the President of the Board of Agriculture that that which has been up to now looked upon as a great hardship will be removed, and that the compensation will be a charge on the Small Holdings Fund and thus not result in increasing the charge to the small holder.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01392"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend answers the Question I should like to put a supplementary Question about a case which has not yet arisen, as the compulsory sale has not yet taken place. In this case the County Council of Northumberland propose to purchase compulsorily a farm near Morpeth. The present tenant took the farm from me a year ago in order to provide for his deceased brother's children, his brother having long been tenant of the farm. Supposing his nephews, for whom he took the farm, had been put in as joint tenants, they would each have a very small holding,
<col>658</col>
but as it is he is the tenant, and very strongly objects to give up the farm. I wish to know- whether, in case compulsory powers are taken, this man will have compensation. In the county council itself a member protested against this act, as he thought that to turn orphan children away from the land on which they expected to make their livelihood would be a hardship and an injustice. I myself should be very sorry to see this done, not so much because I care for keeping the farm in my possession, but because it seems to me that it is likely to do great discredit to the working of this Act, certainly unless the tenant can get compensation. I shall be very glad to know what is likely to happen in that case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01393"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, has put to me two Questions. He first asks whether it has been finally decided that Mr. Clark, whose farm at Welwick was taken for small holdings, is not to receive compensation for disturbance out of the Small Holdings Fund. The answer is in the affirmative. It has been finally decided that this gentleman is not to receive any compensation out of this Fund. The noble Earl went on to ask, as I understood, whether it might not be referred to the Law Officers of the Crown to know whether such a thing was possible. I think the noble Earl must remember that in the Small Holdings Act, which your Lordships were graciously pleased to allow the Government to pass through this House, there was no provision of that sort at all.<lb/>
I need not go into the whole story again, but in the Land Tenure Act, which was also permitted to pass this House, there was no provision for compensation to be paid by individual landlords, and therefore it was considered that it would not be quite fair to take out of the public purse money for compensation in cases in which it would not be given by private owners. But a good deal of water has flown under the bridges since then, and small holdings are now, I think, an acknowledged fact, and are supposed to be to some extent a success. In two years we have got 75,000 acres of land in England, and we have only had to take 11,000 acres by compulsion. I think that is very satisfactory, and it shows that not only noble Lords opposite but landlords all over England do recognise
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0355"/>
<col>659</col>
what a great boon small holdings are to the working population, and that they have most generously and handsomely done their duty as far as lay in their power.<lb/>
As regards Mr. Clark's case, it has, as I have said, been finally decided that it is impossible to compensate him out of the Small Holdings Fund. This was one of those extreme cases which always happen in the carrying out of any fresh legislation, and it was a case in which I honestly thought that compensation might very fairly be paid. I therefore asked the Treasury if it could be given, but there were reasons&#x2014;I acknowledge that they were very strong and good reasons&#x2014;why such a departure could not be made. I therefore wrote to Mr. Clark telling him the facts, and regretting that nothing could be done. I would not mention this had it not been for the speech of the noble Earl. I went down to Hull in December of last year and had a farmers' "At Home," which was very numerously attended. Between 100 and 150 Holderness farmers were kind enough to smoke a cigar with me after the farmers' ordinary, and I need not say that the case of Mr. Clark, of Welwick, was the chief topic of conversation. I do not know whether the noble Earl knows Mr. Clark.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01394"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01395"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: He is one of the best representatives of the Holderness farmers. I do not think I can put it higher than that. He is a capital fellow in every way, a man much respected in the countryside and easy to deal with. We had a conversation which lasted nearly three hours, and at last we came to an agreement. I said to him, "There is going to be an election next year, and nobody knows how the election may turn out. I should be very sorry that any body should be left on the Crown Estate with a nasty taste in his mouth so far as I am concerned. I honestly think you are entitled to compensation, and I have tried to get it from the Treasury. But as I cannot get you &#x00A3;100 out of the Treasury, and as I suppose I am morally responsible for your displacement from the farm, I shall be very happy as a Crown Commissioner to make you a present of &#x00A3;50 myself, and I hope it will be accepted in the same spirit in which it is offered." The Holderness farmers are a very gentlemanly lot of men. They said: "Oh, no; we will not stand that.
<col>660</col>
Will you get him another farm when another farm comes in, and give it to him for his son?" I may say that the farm we had to take for small holdings was in time to come to be farmed by his son. I replied that that was all settled; that I had promised him the first chance of occupying another farm, and that I hoped my successor in days to come would bear the matter in mind. Later I received a very pleasant letter from Mr. Clark. He accepted my offer in the same spirit in which it was made, and so the matter is happily concluded so far as Mr. Clark is concerned.<lb/>
I always was of opinion that something ought to be done in regard to the compulsory taking of land from tenant farmers who were on private estates, and as we have to be very particular in these days, especially about commas, perhaps I may be permitted to read&#x2014;it will not take a moment&#x2014;what I said in the House of Lords on May 17 of last year [&#x2020;] in answer to a Question put by Lord Onslow. I then said&#x2014;
<quote>"Perhaps I may be permitted to say that whatever are the equities of the case as between a private landlord and a tenant, there is great force in the argument that a tenant has special ground for compensation where land is acquired for small holdings by county councils under the Act. In furtherance of a great national policy, which we hope will keep the people on the land, machinery has been set up which must inevitably bring prematurely to an end tenancies which must otherwise have existed for years to the satisfaction of owner and occupier. It is said&#x2014;and I will admit the truth of it&#x2014;that we have introduced a new and disturbing element into rural life. I repeat that I believe that is perfectly true; but, at the same time, I am convinced that what we have done will stir up the sluggish waters of rural life and convert them into living streams. This, of course, may entail changes and movements which may put farmers to some inconvenience and expense. It follows, therefore, that this class are the strongest critics of the Small Holdings Act. They are reluctant to see it put into force, not only on their own farms, but on the farms of their neighbours; and, naturally, they enlist the sympathy of the landlords, some of whom are unwilling to bring tenancies to an end for the sake of what they probably consider to be a problematic advantage to themselves and others."</quote>
That is what I thought all along, and to that opinion I still adhere. As regards the noble Earl's second Question&#x2014;namely, whether His Majesty's Government intend to bring in a Bill to prevent similar cases of hardship in the future&#x2014;the answer is Yes.</membercontribution></p>

I am given to understand that that is the case. I hope it is true, and I trust that this will pacify to some extent the opposition felt to the Act by some tenant farmers. No doubt it is a disagreeable thing to have a portion of one's farm taken away. Still, we have been told that we must make sacrifices for the public good, and I hope, with this concession, that we shall not have any serious opposition to the principle of small holdings, which I believe is a policy appreciated and approved of by both sides of the House and by all classes of His Majesty's subjects.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01406"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I hope it will be introduced in your Lordships' House. In spite of these touching accounts of convivial meetings held on the eve of a General Election, this is felt to be a very grave injustice. I know that objection is taken to the word "injustice" in connection with this matter, but it is nothing short of a very serious injustice,
<col>662</col>
and it is a very doubtful policy with regard to agriculture. We are told this evening that 11,000 acres have already been acquired compulsorily. It seems to me that the stirring up of the sluggish waters of rural life and converting them into living streams by means of compulsion has been going on at an alarming rate, because last December we were told that 8,000 acres had been acquired compulsorily for this purpose. The agricultural community of this country have found it very difficult indeed to understand the attitude of the Government towards the sitting tenant. First of all, soon after they came into office they adopted a Bill which certainly would have had the result of sitting tenant against landlord and landlord against tenant to a very undesirable degree. That Bill left Parliament in a very different shape from that in which it entered it. But the point I wish to make about that is that the one reason we were always begged to accept that Bill was that it would do good to agriculture because it would remove from the tenant the chance, which we say was an entirely illusory one, of being capriciously evicted by his landlord. Everybody knew that the number of cases of capricious eviction of ten ant farmers was hardly worth mentioning, and certainly not sufficient to justify a Bill of a highly controversial character. The next thing we are told is that in order to for ward the Small Holdings Act <i>carte blanche</i> is to be given to take as much land as you like, and that the men dispossessed are not to have recourse to the ordinary remedy which other subjects of His Majesty have when their property is taken away from them by force. Therefore I thank the noble Earl very much for his promise to bring forward a Bill, and I hope we shall have some assurance from His Majesty's Government this afternoon that as we are still able, I believe, to take part in the legislative business of the country, we may have an opportunity of dealing with this subject before our existence is put an end to.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01408"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will have appreciated very highly the noble Earl Lord Carrington's clever manner of getting over difficulties in exceptional cases with reference to this Act, but I think it would become a tedious operation if it had to be carried on for long and in connection with many cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01409"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01410"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: The consumption of tobacco at these gatherings and the wearisomeness of three-hour conversations with tenants who had complained would be a serious task to put on any noble Lord who might hereafter hold the post which the noble Earl now occupies. Therefore I think we are all glad to hear that there is a prospect of this matter being dealt with in a satisfactory manner by legislation. The noble Earl said a good deal about the great boon it was to those who had obtained small holdings, but we should guard very carefully against injury being caused to any individual in giving a boon to somebody else. If it is thought necessary to take away a man's land or interfere with his farm, the burden and cost of it should certainly not be placed on the individual, but on some proper fund sanctioned by law. As far as I am concerned, and I think I may speak for those who sit with me on this side of the House, we shall give every consideration to such a Bill as this, and I hope the Government will bring the measure forward at an early date.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01457"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Earl who leads the House is now in a position to supplement the statement which he made last week in reply to a Question by my noble friend Lord Salisbury, but I think your Lordships will be glad of any information regarding the adjournment for the Spring Recess and the course of business before and after that recess. We have in front of us
<col>668</col>
the Budget, which I understand will pass through the House of Commons on the 27th, the Resolutions of Lord Rosebery, and also the Resolutions of the Government dealing with the relations between the two Houses. With regard to the Budget, all I will venture to say is this, that I imagine it will be the general desire of the House that it should be taken here without a moment's loss of time, when the House of Commons has done with it. Lord Rosebery is not in his place, and I am unable to say what his intentions are in regard to his Resolutions. The noble Earl gave notice of a second batch on the 13th, and I have no doubt the House would desire ample opportunities of considering and discussing them. There remain the Resolutions dealing with the relations between the two Houses, Resolutions which the noble Earl who leads the House described, and not incorrectly, as of supreme importance. We should like to know, if the noble Earl is able to tell us, when he proposes to take those Resolutions. Perhaps I might also ask whether the Bill founded upon these Resolutions is likely to be produced before long. The Bill has, I understand, been read a first time in the other House, and is no doubt in a forward state of preparation. The noble Earl told us the other day that there would be no undue delay in the production of the Bill, but he was then unable to name the precise date when it would be produced. We should certainly be grateful for any information on that point; and, finally, we should be glad to know what the intentions are with regard to the adjournment of the House for the Spring Recess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01458"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Marquess for having given me notice of his intention to put these further Questions. Since replying to Lord Salisbury a week ago I have had the opportunity of making some inquiries as to the general sense of the House with regard to the course of business. As regards the Resolutions dealing with the relations between the two Houses, we were quite prepared to deal with them at once, if that course had commended itself to the House, and I should have been prepared to put them down for discussion next week. But I am given to understand that that course would not be acceptable to the House in view of the position of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0360"/>
<col>669</col>
public business generally, and other questions to which the noble Marquess alluded. The Finance Bill now under discussion in another place is due to be finished in that House on April 27, and we should be prepared to put the Second Reading down for discussion in this House on the 28th, in view of the noble Marquess's expression of opinion that it should be proceeded with at once. Then as regards the recess, it is suggested that the House of Commons should rise for not less than three weeks at that time, and if, as I understand, it is the view of your Lordships' House that we deserve a similar holiday, we should be prepared, after disposing of the Budget, to adjourn for a similar recess. This would involve the postponement of the consideration of the Government Resolutions till immediately after that recess. That is the course which we are prepared to adopt in view of what I understand to be the opinion of noble Lords generally. It, I think, would mean&#x2014;perhaps the noble Marquess will not bind me absolutely to dates&#x2014;that the discussion on the Resolutions would be opened in the week of May 23, which, I gather, is the date at which the recess would close. As regards the Bill, I am not able to give the actual date at which it will be produced, but I am able to say that, in view of the discussion of our Resolutions, the Bill will Certainly be public property before the Resolutions come up for discussion in this House. As regards the Resolutions of my noble friend, I am not in possession of his
<col>670</col>
intentions with regard to their discussion, but I think I may assume that it is the desire of your Lordships' House to discuss them within a reasonable time. Perhaps I am right in saying that it would be the desire of the House if possible, in view of the fact that there is not much business on the Paper, to proceed with that discussion before we adjourn for the Spring Recess, but I have no knowledge of what my noble friend's intentions are, and therefore I do not know that I need say anything more on that point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01460"><sup>*</sup><membercontribution>THE EARL OF CREWE: We shall be in the hands of the House in that matter. The adjournment for the recess is to be moved in another place, I understand, on the 28th, but if it should be desired to discuss the Budget further here, the Royal Assent would have to be postponed. It would simply mean that we would have to sit a day or two days longer.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01478"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was sorry not to be in my place yesterday when the question arose as to the time when the Resolutions standing in my name should be brought forward. I have taken every opportunity to-day and previously during the week to find out what would be most to the convenience of noble Lords generally, and I understand that if I were to give notice for next Monday, as I had at one time thought of doing, if I received encouragement, that would be considered too short a notice. I have, therefore, put the Resolutions down for the first day of the meeting of the House of Lords after the recess. I see by the report of what passed yesterday that my noble friend opposite proposes to take the Government's Resolutions as soon as possible after the recess. But I think he will agree that it is better that our Resolutions should have priority in our own House, more especially as they have been for some time on the Paper and as in any case the postponement cannot be for more than two or three days after the time that he had originally contemplated.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01484"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is brought in to get rid of a small difficulty in the civil work of Assizes. The Juries Act of 1825, Section 22, limits the number of common jurors who may be summoned to 144. With the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor the Judges have been arranging for very extended sittings at Manchester and Liverpool, and we have assigned a Judge to take the civil work for a period of about two months and it
<col>674</col>
may be more. As these common jurors have to servo on criminal and civil cases, at times the number of 144 would not be enough. I therefore propose to repeal the words "not exceeding one hundred and forty-four." Exactly the same difficulty arose in connection with special jurors, and a similar course was taken in 1898 when a Bill was passed excising the limit of numbers. I provide in this Bill that the High Court shall have power to make rules so that there shall be no excessive summoning of county jurors.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PERSIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01488"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose "to ask His Majesty's Government whether they will state what is the position of the negotiations in regard to Persia obtaining a loan from Great Britain and Russia." The noble Lord said: My Lords, ours is not the only country that is undergoing a constitutional spring-cleaning. This process is taking place in an excessive degree in Persia, only her operations are hampered to a far greater degree than our own by the lack of money. I have raised this question because it is imperative for Persia to have the means of carrying on her administration, and she can only obtain the necessary funds through a loan guaranteed by our Government and that of Russia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01489">The amount asked for is comparatively small. It is calculated that with so small a sum as &#x00A3;500,000 Persia could be set on her feet, and it would have been thought that these two great countries between them would have been able to make this advance without any difficulty. No doubt the intentions of His Majesty's Government are excellent in this matter, but there is reason to doubt whether they have stood steadfastly by Persia in these negotiations. I am not by any means complaining of the action of Russia. Her attitude
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0363"/>
<col>675</col>
towards the national movement in Persia has always been perfectly clear. For her own reasons she has not regarded that movement with approval, and ever since it was started she has done her best to thwart it. Therefore it is quite natural that Russia would regard with disfavour any procedure calculated to give Persia a greater amount of independence. The result has been that conditions too onerous for the acceptance of Persia were attached to the proposed loan. Possibly the Persian Government might have accepted them, but the Mejliss would not submit to those conditions; and I do not think we should blame them for striving to free themselves from foreign domination.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01490">Persia's efforts to secure independence are at times referred to slightingly in the Press. For my own part I think every fair-minded person should admire the conduct of that small band of patriots who have shaken off the worst despotism of modern times, and who have succeeded at least in setting up the machinery of constitutional government. They have done this without any money at their disposal. They acquired an empty Treasury and yet have for months, till the incident recently reported in the Press, kept order in a country seamed by mountain ranges and broken up by desert tracts, and I do not believe that at any time during these troubles, until recently, have the life and property of Europeans been really in danger in Persia. This has been managed in the face of the fact that the troops of another Power have been garrisoning certain towns in Persian territory, thereby diminishing the prestige of her Government and emboldening the old reactionary party to, if possible, subvert the new Constitution. In spite of these difficulties, which I think may be described as almost unparalleled in the case of a newly-born Constitution, they have, as I say, achieved a reasonable amount of success, and consequently they deserve our encouragement and goodwill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01491">His Majesty's Government take credit to themselves for the Anglo-Russian Convention, and all that I ask is that they should see that life and substance are given to it. The Preamble of that Convention recites that&#x2014;
<quote>"The two Governments engage to respect the integrity and independence of Persia."</quote>
That, I maintain, is exactly what they have failed to do. I would undertake
<col>676</col>
that, given the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country and allowing free action to the Persian Government, then, even possibly without the aid of a loan, the peaceful development of Persia, which is what the Convention sought, would be obtained. The conditions of the loan were published the other day in the Press, and without going into details it may be stated that the conditions were of too hampering and onerous a nature to impose on any self-respecting country. I have heard, on what as far as I can ascertain is perfectly reliable authority, that, ever when it was a question of obtaining a considerable sum of money which had nothing to do either with the Government of Russia or with ourselves, as soon as it was understood that this money might be paid into the Persian Exchequer the Russian representative and our representative at once agreed that it would not do to allow any money to be given to Persia, as thereby she would be in a position to carry out her own system of government. I say that that is diametrically opposed to any idea of allowing Persia a free hand in her work of regeneration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01492">The outcome of all this is not only to increase the difficulties of the Government in keeping order amongst the tribes with the return of Spring and the melting of the snows, but also it has led, as we have recently seen in the Press, to the intrusion of Germany. I do not profess to know the result of that, but, obviously, the intervention of a third great Power will not tend to facilitate matters or to diminish the complications in Persia; and if it has met with any success it is because we have been subservient to the policy of fettering Persia, of making her weak and disorganised, instead of endeavouring to let her realise her dream of a free regenerated country. Formerly we enjoyed the goodwill and confidence of the entire population and the special regard of the Nationalists. This position we have now forfeited, and it is not surprising, in view of our pusillanimous action, if Persia in her despair and needing outside support should be ready to meet the advances of Germany.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01493">It would seem that we are engaged in a dog-and-manger policy or what may soon become a dog-and-manger policy, and the outcome of it will be not only to stifle Persian independence but to lead to com-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0364"/>
<col>677</col>
plications disastrous in their effect to our position in the Middle East. The Mahomedan world is beginning to assert itself, and Persia is the geographical centre of that great belt of Mahomedanism which stretches from the Atlantic to the China Sea. It is also the political and literary centre, and Mahomedans associate largely their past greatness with Persia. The thoughts of a Mahomedan revival sprung from Persia, and therefore if Persia is crippled and her position lowered in the eyes of the whole Mahomedan world, that will react most unfavourably on our own Mahomedan subjects. I have been told that the Persians in their distress have sent emissaries to Mahomedans in India. More-ever, it is very unlikely that Turkey would regard with favour the humiliating position in which Persia is placed. The future promises chaos, yet the danger might be averted. It seems so simple merely for both parties honestly to act up to the spirit of the Convention, and then, with an independent Persia, there would be the strongest bulwark against possible friction between ourselves and Russia. The position is far more favourable in these circumstances for a frank understanding with Russia than it was at the time of the signing of the Convention, when there was the corrupt rule of the late Shah to be dealt with. By the establishment of Persia on a sound footing the prestige and security of our Indian Empire would be immeasurably enhanced.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01494">There is one further point I should like to mention. Second only to the authority of our representative at Teheran is that of <i>The Times</i>. For some unexplained reason that great journal has gone quite round in its attitude towards Persia, and now belittles their new aspirations and upholds the ascendancy of the two parties to the Convention. This change of feeling has had a grievous effect on the friendly attitude of the Persians towards us. Recently, in the review of a Life of Warren Hastings, <i>The Times</i> article concluded with a quotation that seems to me, and inferentially to <i>The Times</i> itself, to be very apposite to present circumstances. The anecdote is a record of a conversation in 1814 between Hastings and a young naval lieutenant of his own name, in the course of which the Persian Gulf was mentioned. Hastings said&#x2014;
<quote>"If I were the War Minister of the Czar I should not spend time and effort in trying to get
<col>678</col>
to Constantinople by way of Europe. I should endeavour to occupy Persia, and to establish myself at the head of the Persian Gulf. I should then be in a fine position; I could strike at India with one hand and at Asia Minor with the other."</quote>
That quotation, my Lords, sets forth my own fears with regard to this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01495"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we have all listened with interest to the speech of the noble Lord on a subject with which he is so competent to deal and upon which he feels strongly; but I am obliged to point out that that speech does constitute something of an abuse of the forms of this House. The noble Lord put on the Paper quite a simple Question, with no notice of motion or any indication that he intended to raise the entire question of the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Persia, and, indeed, other matters which may be of a kindred character but are not absolutely involved in that policy; and the noble Lord has come down with a number of papers and made a speech as I say of great interest, but one which is altogether outside the terms of the Question which he placed on the Paper. If he had stated that he desired to call attention to the policy of His Majesty's Government in Persia it would have been a different case, and I might have communicated with him beforehand as to whether it was desirable at this particular moment that such a discussion should be raised. In the circumstances I am afraid I must ask to be excused from following the noble Lord into the question of policy which he has raised, and confine myself simply to answering his Question. Of course the nature of that answer he will know beforehand&#x2014;namely, that the negotiations in question have been broken off because the Persian Government have not seen their way to comply with the conditions for the loan which were asked for by the British and Russian Governments. Speaking generally, I need only say that His Majesty's Government are inspired by nothing but feelings of the utmost goodwill towards the Persian Government and the Persian nation; but in this particular instance they found it necessary to impose these conditions, and as the conditions could not be complied with it has not been found possible to make the advance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01496"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the concluding words of the noble Earl's speech will probably have served somewhat to reassure my noble friend who
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0365"/>
<col>679</col>
has called attention to this matter. Both sides of the House must feel that this country cannot be indifferent to what happens in Persia. Her geographical position makes it inevitable that we should take an interest in all that concerns her, and at this moment we are no doubt all of us animated by a feeling of sincere sympathy with the new Persian Government in its endeavour to evolve order out of the chaotic condition of things which has lately obtained in Persia. But, my Lords, I am bound to say it seems to me that the noble Earl is justified in asking my noble friend not to press him for more precise information as to the negotiations which are now proceeding. Those negotiations must obviously be of a very delicate and difficult character, and if the noble Earl thinks it inconsistent with the public interest that a statement should be made going beyond that which he has already offered to the House, I certainly do not think we on this side would be justified in asking for such a statement.</membercontribution></p>

</ul></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01533">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I would ask your kind indulgence whilst I, as shortly as I can, explain the Resolution which stands in my name on the Notice Paper.
<col>684</col>
I have been a long time in Parliament, but I never recollect a state of things such as the present. The House of Lords, the Press, and politicians in general appear to suffer from a very catching disease&#x2014;the reform of the House of Lords. The other night 175 of your Lordships showed that they had got this disease and went in for the reform of the House of Lords. Seventeen of your Lordships showed that they were immune, and they followed the sanitary guidance of my noble and learned friend Lord Hal bury into the Lobby. Therefore with not a third of the House present your Lordships voted away your hereditary rights on that occasion. Where were the other two-thirds? I know not; but public rumour says that they were afraid of infection and stayed away. That may or may not be.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01534">My noble friend Lord Rosebay has got the disease rather badly. Perhaps you are not aware that I am his guardian as well as his friend. As I say, he has got the disease rather badly, and he has produced a lot of Resolutions to cure the evil which he sees. And what is the evil which he sees? It is the weakness of your Lordships' House. The object of my noble friend's Resolutions is to strengthen your Lordships' House. Whatever another place may do or feel, I am quite certain that your Lordships backed my noble friend because of his intention, which is to strengthen this House. My object, I may say, is the same as that of my noble friend. My modest Resolution would, I think, greatly strengthen this House, as I shall endeavour to show.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01535">But before I go on to speak about the Resolution I wish to say this. I feel it rather presumptuous on my part to venture to speak to your Lordships on this important question; but I would have you remember that I have been for twenty-seven years a member of your Lordships' House and that prior to that I was for forty-two years in the House of Commons. Therefore combining those two stages of life I think I can claim to have had plenty of opportunities of considering the question of the two Houses of Parliament. Further than that, in 1852, to my great surprise, I heard my name come out in the House of Commons as one of the ten Chairmen of Committees appointed for the year. I was sitting when this came out next to my friend George Smythe, who said&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0368"/>
<col>685</col>
<quote>"I congratulate you on being in the Cabinet of I the House of Commons."</quote>
That shows, I think, that I have some reason for the action I am taking on this occasion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01536">The conclusion to which I have come as regards your Lordships' House is this, that as a business assembly it has no fear of comparison with another place. One great characteristic of your Lordships' House is its reticence. No Peer speaks unless he has something which he really wishes to say, or unless there is some Bill before the House which he desires either to support or oppose. But, in spite of that reticence, if there is to be a great debate and eloquence is wanted your Lordships' House would compare most favourably with your neighbour, gagged and guillotined as he is. <i>A propos</i> of that, can anything be more absurd than the gag and guillotine applied to one of the great representative bodies of Parliament? In these circumstances the name of Parliament ought to be changed. The reticence of your Lordships is greatly due to the fact that you sit here by hereditary right; you have no constituents to look to, and no Bills to bring in to take away property from one set of men and give it to another possessing a larger number of votes on the other side. Therefore your Lordships' House may compare favourably with the other House of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01537">Having stated the advantages of your Lordships' House, let me say what I think are its defects. What appears to me to be wanting in this Assembly is this. You require in the first place, if you can get it, a representative backing. The other defect is that your Lordships do not attend as well as you might, except on certain occasions. The want of attendance and the absence of backing are the chief defects, and I think I shall be able to show that this Resolution will remedy both. But before doing that I would like to explain how this Resolution came on the Paper. It is not new. It is not the result of the disease of which I spoke. It struck me some years ago that it would be a good thing to get representation of this kind. At that time my noble friend Lord Glenesk was alive, and I showed him my Resolution as drawn here. He highly approved of it, and to my surprise the next day it appeared in the papers. After that I endeavoured to find out how it would be
<col>686</col>
received by some of the bodies whom it was intended should be represented, and the result is the list which appears on the Notice Paper which I hold in my hand. All these important public bodies approve of the Resolution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01538">I have said that this Resolution would meet the two wants to which I have referred as affecting this House. How would it do that, my Lords? You have only to read this list to see that there is here represented the greater portion of the organised brains of this country. And if, without bother of any kind, without any canvassing or attempting to get votes, you simply allow these bodies to name three of your Lordships to represent them you would then cover the defect as to want of representation, because you would be the representatives of the organised brains of Britain. As regards the other point, I believe, if this Resolution was adopted and the nomination by these bodies consequent upon it became an accomplished fact, that noble Lords would attend better, because the sense of representative responsibility would be greater. Your Lordships may naturally ask, why did you not bring the Resolution forward sooner&#x2014;say three or four years ago? Before doing so I was anxious to ensure success as far as I could. I was not prepared that so sound an idea should be imperilled by the chance of being voted out, and therefore I delayed it in the hope of getting that necessary support. I cannot say that I have been successful; but in justice to these great societies who have put their faith in your Lordships' House and assented to this Resolution I could not further postpone it, and therefore it is that I now bring it forward.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01539">I have really little more to add, but before concluding I would call attention to this list of important public bodies that favour and are appended. I have made a sort of general abstract of the list. These bodies represent art, architecture, science, literature, medicine, shipping, building, railways, and commerce. There are, in addition, the Land Agents' Society, a very important organisation, and the Employers' Parliamentary Council, representing thirty important trades. Then there is the Liberty and Property Defence League, which represents nearly one hundred societies interested in land, in manufacture, and other things. I am chairman
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0369"/>
<col>687</col>
of that league. I started it some eight-and-twenty years ago, but I did not like myself to propose that it should join these public bodies. The suggestion was made by one of the members, and I was not present when the question was discussed, so that personally I had no hand in the matter. I strongly urge your Lordships to accept the principle of my Resolution, leaving matters of detail&#x2014;details, somehow or other, always arrange themselves in this world&#x2014;for further consideration. It in no way affects the Resolutions of my noble friend on the Cross Benches or any other Resolutions. My noble friends may move Resolutions as they like. This proposal would strengthen their position as well as the general position of your Lordships' House. I therefore hope that favourable consideration will be given to my Resolution. By that means, simply by a Resolution, without any Bill, without any canvassing, by merely sitting still and receiving the nominations from these bodies, great strength would be added to your Lordships' House. You would get the intellectual representative backing which you do not now possess, and I think your Lordships' House would thus be strengthened for the coming revolutionary constitutional fight in which you will very soon find yourselves engaged. I commend my Resolution to your Lordships' favourable consideration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01540"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I share the gratification that evidently animates the whole House at my noble friend's introducing this subject to your attention. It was my fortune to sit with the noble Earl for a certain time in the House of Commons, and it was always my ill-fortune to differ from him. I am afraid I differ from him now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01541"><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member><membercontribution>: Why?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01542"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I am going to say why. The noble Earl began with a very plain statement of the difficulties under which we are labouring. All of us, whether it be noble Lords opposite or my noble friend on the Cross Bench, are labouring admittedly under enormous difficulties. The noble Earl seems to me to have brought forward a proposal which only amounts to what has been called prescribing a pill for an earthquake. That there is a sort of earthquake is scarcely to
<col>688</col>
be denied. I am one of those who hope that even now by prudence, vigilance, patience, good-will an earthquake may be avoided and this great controversy may have an adequate solution. But this proposal I do not believe will lead in the slightest degree in that direction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01543"><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member><membercontribution>: It will strengthen the House of Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01544"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I cannot myself think it will in any way or any degree strengthen the House of Lords. My noble friend referred to the principle and the details. I venture to differ from him as to the principle and as to the details in the schedule. The schedule itself would take this House three or four days to adjust.<lb/>
It is one of the faultiest schedules&#x2014;if I may say so without arrogance&#x2014;I ever read in all my life. It is so imperfect. For example, you have the College of Physicians, but what has become of the College of Surgeons? You have the Oddfellows, but what has become of the Free Foresters?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01545"><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member><membercontribution>: This is not a schedule. It is merely a statement of approving bodies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01546"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: But the list is in the nature of a schedule. If you follow my noble friend's lead you will need a Bill and a schedule, and the schedule will in fact contain all these bodies, and, I should say, 100 or 200 more. There will be no end to the number of bodies who will claim the right of nominating members in your Lordships' House to act on their behalf. I will put another objection. Supposing three members of your Lordships' House were nominated by the College of Physicians, the Royal Society, or whatever body you like, how can you be sure their influence in your Lordships' House would be strengthened by the knowledge that they were nominated to represent what I must call in some cases trade unions? One of the great arguments that has been constantly used against the representatives of such bodies is that they are delegates, that they are not independent, that they do not speak their own minds. With the knowledge which I have of trade unions I do not admit these allegations, but these allegations will be made as to the members of your Lordships' House who
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0370"/>
<col>689</col>
are told off by these rather miscellaneous bodies, and the hundred other bodies equally miscellaneous who might be added.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01547"><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member><membercontribution>: Many more would be added.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01548"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Just so; so much the worse. Then I would put this point. Should not we listen to any one of your Lordships who got up to talk on any particular topic with the more deference, and weigh his arguments with the more care, if we knew he was speaking, as we are all supposed to do, with an independent mind? I think we should. I am not going to enter into a comparison between the oratorical ability and the political capacity of this House and the oratorical ability and political capacity to be found in another place. Your Lordships will not, I hope, suppose that I, though a very new member of this House, am at all inclined&#x2014;quite the contrary&#x2014;to say a depreciatory or disparaging word of the intellectual power and political capacity of this House, but its judgment is another thing on which I would like to reserve, at least not to-day to express, my opinion. What I am delighted to think is that if you take the two debates we had in this House, the one in November and December, and the debate the other day on my noble friend's Resolutions, and then if you take the debates in another place upon what are called the Veto Resolutions, and so forth, any impartial man in either House might be very proud to think that the two Houses together can afford such a splendid exhibition on both sides of debating power. That would be my answer to all the croakings I hear about Parliamentary decadence. There may be some features that we do not like in novel Parliamentary procedure, but as to the ability, public spirit, the disinterestedness shown, I do not think there has ever been a time in our history when the two Houses could come better out than they have done now up to this point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01549"><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member><membercontribution>: We have no guillotine here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01550"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: That is quite true, but it does not bear on what I am saying. I think it is rather idle to contend, as I see it contended in the Press, that the House of Commons is be
<col>690</col>
coming very inferior in its debating qualities to the House of Commons of old, and I think this House should be just as glad as the other House itself that the level in both Houses is maintained at the elevation that marked it during the debates to which I have referred. After all, we are all of us patriots, and I for one have no patience with the croakings that I hear as to the decline of Parliamentary ability. My noble friend has tempted me into that excursus. But to return. The principle of his proposal, so far as it has a principle, is that special interests ought to have special representatives told off in your Lordships' House. The Royal Society, I think, is one of the bodies mentioned; at all events, the Royal Society, if such proposal were seriously taken up, would be included. I suggest, however, that my noble friend Lord Rayleigh, without any instructions from the Royal Society, would be perfectly able to represent that body. From his own extraordinary knowledge of the topics that come within its consideration, he would be able to give your Lordships the very best knowledge and judgment on any one of those special topics that you could find. It would be invidious to go through the members of your Lordships' House who possess special qualifications. But I see my noble friend Lord Revelstoke here. Do you need bankers to tell off three of your Lordships to speak about banking? You have already full and adequate representation of banking interests. Then there is my noble friend Lord Avebury, who can tell you about a great many things from banking and commerce to wasps and bees. Last year a Bill affecting insurance companies was considered, and a great number of your Lordships addressed the House upon it with special, technical, and full knowledge. If all the insurance companies in England were to tell off special members to speak on these subjects you would not be a bit better off than you are now. The Abb&#x00E9; Siey&#x00E8; s&#x2014;of whom I am greatly reminded every day of the week by the number of fantastical proposals I see made for the construction of Second Chambers&#x2014;said there are in politics no insoluble problems; there are only problems badly stated. I submit that this matter is part of an immense problem. The noble Earl has dealt with only one or two phases of a huge problem, and I do not think he has placed the problem before your Lordships in a way that tends to its satisfactory solution.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0371"/>
<col>691</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01551"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will allow me to congratulate the noble Earl who drew attention to this subject on his recovery from his recent indisposition, which has left no trace upon the vigour and eloquence with which he addresses us, and I trust the somewhat severe dissection of his proposal by the noble Viscount will not occasion a relapse. The noble Earl has, indeed, made a proposal which shows the full amount of that courage which never deserts him, because he has ventured to lay this matter before you at a time when my noble friend on the Cross Benches is already in the field with a series of Resolutions affecting the constitution of this House, and when the noble Earl who leads this House is also in the field with other and even more important Resolutions which he intends to move immediately after the recess.<lb/>
Whether your Lordships agree or disagree with the noble Earl, I am sure that the feeling of the House will not be at all unfriendly towards his proposal. The principle at which he aims is, I think, a principle which ought to commend itself to your Lordships. The noble Viscount defined that principle in these words&#x2014;that special interests should have special representation in this House. That seems to me an admirable principle, and I should like to see effect given to it if it were possible. Indeed, I am not at all sure whether one of the Resolutions of which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery) has given notice may not be found to bear a construction somewhat of that kind. But the noble Earl desires, as I understand, that the principle should be enforced by establishing a kind of official connection between this House and certain public bodies representing great public interests and carrying with them a great weight of authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01552"><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01553"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I, for one, would be very glad to see a connection of that kind established. I believe that if it could be done the result would be to add authority to your Lordships' House, and to give increased weight to the opinions of individual Peers who might be designated in that manner. I suggest, and I think the noble Viscount made the same suggestion, that something of the kind really in fact exists already; although not, perhaps,
<col>692</col>
in a formal or recognised shape. We know, for example, that when questions concerning the Army or Navy are discussed there are certain noble Lords whom the House recognises as qualified to speak on behalf of the two services. There are certain noble Lords who can speak with special authority on financial questions. Then, again, take the case of my noble friend Lord Belper, who represents the Association of County Councils, and to whom we all listen with a feeling that he has a right to address us on subjects connected with local government. I do not know whether it is very easy to go further, and to do what I understand the noble Earl proposes&#x2014;namely, to stereotype arrangements of that kind and to devise machinery by which these public bodies would be brought into formal and definite relations with the House.<lb/>
The noble Earl will forgive me if I say that I discern considerable difficulty in giving effect to his scheme. When he put the Motion upon the Paper of the House some months ago he went more into particulars than he has done on this occasion. I think I am right in saying that at that time he proposed to set up what I may describe as a "quadrumvirate," consisting of the Lord Chancellor, the Leader of the House, my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury, and myself, and upon us was to be thrown the duty of deciding what public bodies and associations were to be deemed worthy to be brought into official relation with the House. I confess that never was my vanity more tickled than by the idea of serving with three such distinguished colleagues; but my heart sank within me when I considered the kind of task which was to be imposed upon us. The number of such associations is very great. The noble Earl referred me to "Whitaker's Almanack," where, I believe, ten pages are filled with their names.</membercontribution></p>

So that there is every variety of body to be considered, and I really do not know how it would be possible for such a body as the noble Earl

proposes to decide which associations are worthy of recognition and which are not. Then there is another difficulty which I think lies in the way. Suppose the principle admitted, who is to decide what Peers are to represent what associations? I do not know whether that would be part of the duty of the "quadrumvirate." Obviously some one would have to do it, for I anticipate we should find that most of these bodies and associations would be competing with one another over the body of my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn who doubtless would be very largely in request for business of that kind. My noble friend shakes his head. Suppose we had disposed of Lord St. Aldwyn, and another association came round. We should be obliged to say, "We cannot give you the Peer whom you want; but here is another noble Lord who acquitted himself very creditably upon the platform during the last General Election and who shows great promise. We suggest you might adopt him." The association might not agree with our choice. I see almost endless difficulties
<col>694</col>
in carrying out the noble Earl's scheme, and I humbly suggest to him that the more informal plan is the best. It might, perhaps, be possible to regularise somewhat more than we do the existing arrangements; but it would not, in my opinion, be desirable to commit the House to a formal plan either of selecting any public bodies as fit and proper bodies to receive this honour or of selecting certain Peers to whom the task of representing them would be assigned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01574" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01575">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01576"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill that I am going to ask your Lordships to read a second time this afternoon is in a sense what might be called a blood relation to a similar Bill that was introduced in your Lordships' House some two years ago by my noble friend Lord Wenlock. That Bill received a Second Reading at your Lordships' hands, but was lost in a whirlpool of difficulties and objections raised by the Government and by others in the Committee stage. I hope that the Bill which is now produced for Second Reading will in a sense have met the objections that were entertained by the Treasury at that time, and will have made provision for some of the difficulties that were then raised by the Chief Registrar.<lb/>
The principle of the Bill is to establish co-operative credit societies&#x2014;in other words, village banks&#x2014;which have been found to be such a boon to the poor agricultural population in foreign countries and in Ireland. They are simply humble village banks, restricted in area and in numbers, and provided with borrowing powers to be used for the benefit of the very humblest. Abroad they were inaugurated to meet the very serious position of affairs brought about by the gombeen men, as we call them in Ireland&#x2014;by the usurers of the time. In my humble opinion, the success of the small-holding movement in this country or in Ireland must depend to a great extent on the pro-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0374"/>
<col>697</col>
vision made for co-operation and combination among the small holders, and I am sorry that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, who takes such great interest in this matter, is not in his place this afternoon, because I should have liked him to have heard the principles of this Bill, which I believe will be of enormous benefit to the poorer inhabitants in agricultural districts.<lb/>
What are the means provided to-day for a man to borrow who is really in need of a small loan? The only thing he can do is to travel to the nearest town and apply to probably a joint stock bank managed by a board possessing no interest in the borrower himself or in the nature of the loan. In olden days there were local private bankers, who probably knew the individual who came to apply for the loan, took an interest in him, and were able to judge as to his means and the security he had to offer; but nowadays if a man is desirous of borrowing a small sum the machinery would be that he would have to travel to the nearest town, and take with him his sureties; he would have to spend the whole day getting there, and the chances are that the loan that he would be able to get would be only a small one repayable within a short space of time. And so it would be a real boon to these people if you could bring to their doors a system which would enable them to borrow cheaply. I will come to the system on which I propose to establish these banks in a moment or two.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships that village banks or co-operative credit societies have been in vogue on the Continent for a great number of years&#x2014;in Italy, in Austria-Hungary, in Belgium, and in Germany. In Germany alone there are 15,000 of these banks. They work under different systems, but the majority of them, I believe, are established under what is called the Raffeissen system. Raffeissen was a German, and he was born nearly a century ago. He had aspirations to win his spurs on the battlefield, but owing to physical infirmities he was prevented from joining the Army and became a Civil servant, much, I think, to the benefit of the agricultural population of Germany. Being a Civil servant, he became a burgomaster, and during the years of famine of 1846 and 1847 he came into touch with a condition of affairs that
<col>698</col>
brought at once to his mind the necessity of some sort of reform. He found the down-trodden peasantry suffering iniquitous hardships through being entirely in the hands of the usurer of the day, and he saw at once that some system was necessary to deliver these poor people from the yoke of the usurer and enable them to obtain any small loans that they might require to eke out their existence. And so he established a system of co-operative credit banks. That system was based on one great principle&#x2014;namely, that people should combine, and by their combination offer such security as would enable them to borrow loan capital cheaply and lend to the poor borrower also cheaply. They were able to lend to the borrower cheaply, but they were able by their security to borrow the loan capital still more cheaply. Then by making every member of the society jointly and severally responsible for all the money that was lent a system was set up by which every man was interested in the doings of his neighbour. He was interested in seeing that the security was good and that the loans Were put into the right hands, and so you got a system by which a man sought for no money fee of his own, but was really interested in the welfare of his neighbour. It was a wonderful system.<lb/>
The first bank was started with a loan capital of &#x00A3;300. Gradually the movement spread until now there are 15,000 of these Raffeissen banks in Germany. It is interesting to follow up the life history of that first bank started by Raffeissen. It was only ten years ago, I think, that that bank was wound up owing to the decision of its members to abandon the co-operative principle started by the founder. When they wound up the concern, which, as I have said, was started on a loan capital of &#x00A3;300, they found that &#x00A3;2,000 had accumulated from the small over profits made upon the loans. The rules of these societies are embodied in the second clause of this Bill. Your Lordships will see that they are purely philanthropic institutions. They are not meant in any way to be a source of profit to the members. In one of the rules it is expressly provided that no part of the funds shall be divided among the members by way of profit, bonus, dividend, or otherwise, and that the profits of the society in each year shall be carried to the credit of a reserve fund. It is further provided that if the society is
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0375"/>
<col>699</col>
wound up the reserve fund shall not be divided amongst the members, but shall go to some purpose of public utility in the locality. The reason for that is that you do not want to start a system by which the members of the society would build up a large reserve fund in order that, when the reserve fund was large, they should then have the benefit of dividing it among themselves. These reserve funds are built up to increase the security of the bank, to enable the loan capital to increase, and so facilitate the lending of money to small borrowers.<lb/>
These Raffeissen banks have been taken up not only on the Continent. They already form part of the credit system in our own Empire. Amongst all the great acts of administration which took place in the time of Lord Curzon's Viceroyalty of India, I believe there is no act that will be more gratefully remembered by the ryots of India than the passing of the Indian Credit Society Banks Act of 1904. There are over 2,000 of these credit banks in India at this moment. These societies are incorporated societies, a point to which I will draw your Lordships' attention in a moment or two. <i>Ipso facto</i> when they are established they become incorporated societies. To come nearer home, we find that in the poor congested districts in the West of Ireland these banks have been of enormous benefit to the poor peasant proprietors. The idea was taken up by Sir Horace Plunkett, and now in Ireland we have some 300 of these societies doing well and bringing relief to the poor population. The gombeen man plays a very important part in the life of the Irish peasant. It was to get the peasant out of the clutches of the gombeen man that these credit societies were inaugurated, and they have done exceedingly well. The total loan capital has advanced from &#x00A3;48,718 to &#x00A3;49,840&#x2014;an increase of &#x00A3;1,122 in one year; and the number of loans granted is shown as 8,615.<lb/>
In connection with these credit societies comes the other side of the picture&#x2014;namely, that of thrift. It is better to have your loan capital derived from deposits by the members of the society than to have it from an overdraft at a local bank. It is hoped that eventually these banks will form a well-secured savings bank for the people, and in that direction they will really be a boon to the State, for I
<col>700</col>
must draw your attention to a recent declaration on the part of the Postmaster-General as to the increased expenditure connected with the savings bank system in this country. He says that the cost of administering the Post Office Savings Bank has been much increased of late years by the tendency of depositors to use the institution for the purposes of current accounts instead of for their savings, which was the original object for which the Savings Bank was promoted. The Postmaster-General says:&#x2014;
<quote>"Every transaction, great or small, has necessarily to be reported to London for record in the ledgers at the central office, and this renders business very costly when depositors make frequent deposits and withdrawals, especially when the individual sums are small."</quote>
Therefore I submit that I am right in saying that if these credit societies and small banks are formed on the savings bank principle, they will to a certain extent relieve the Post Office of an encumbrance which is costing them more every year.<lb/>
I now come to the details of the Bill, which is required to grease the wheels of the machine, for in many ways the system is cumbrous at the present moment. First of all, the Bill takes power to incorporate the societies. The incorporation of these societies means that they will stand on their own, and instead of acting through trustees as they have to now under the Friendly Societies Act, they will then be able to sue and be sued on their own account. Secondly, there is power taken to form central institutions. These central banks are institutions in which the affairs and interests of the whole system are focussed. They form the receptacle for the reserve funds of the small local banks, and they are the common cash-box, equalising excess and want and facilitating common business. These central banks are based entirely upon limited liability, as against the unlimited liability of the small credit societies. Then there is one other point to which I wish to draw attention. It is one of the most important parts of the Bill as regards Ireland. This Bill takes power for the trading of these co-operative credit societies. The societies in Ireland are very often seriously hampered for want of this power. I will give your Lordships an illustration. At the beginning of the year 1907 there was a failure in the potato crop
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0376"/>
<col>701</col>
and the Department of Agriculture found themselves in the position of being obliged to find some reliable way of introducing new potato seed into an infected area. They naturally did not want to pauperise the people of the district by distributing seed broadcast through the unions, so they hit upon a plan of providing funds for the credit societies working in the West of Ireland, who were in their turn to hand the money over to their members to enable them to buy seed in the North of Ireland, where the seed was good, under the inspection of their officers. But then it was found that it was not legal for these co-operative societies to trade, and so a cumbrous and roundabout method had to be devised. Committees were formed to buy seeds from the contractors, and the money was handed over from the credit societies to these committees; they in turn dealt with the contractors, and much time was thereby lost and needless expenditure and an infinite amount of trouble occasioned. If, on the other hand, these co-operative trading societies had the legal power of trading, they could have dealt with the contractors straight away and the whole machinery would have been simplified.<lb/>
I may be told that under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act there is a power to trade which is not given under the Friendly Societies Act. But you would then require a share capital with a limited liability, and that destroys the whole principle of the Raffeissen system. The principle of that system is unlimited liability, by which every member jointly and severally is responsible for the amount out on loan. Therefore it is obviously necessary that, if it is to work under the Friendly Societies Act, you want legal powers for trading under that Act. This would be of enormous advantage to Ireland; it is the one thing that is wanting in that country. These powers are possessed on the Continent. The societies on the Continent never really began to flourish until the co-operative trading societies came into existence, with the result that the movement has spread in the manner I have described. This is a very complicated and difficult subject, but I hope I have made the principles of the Bill clear to your Lordships, and I trust that it will receive the sympathetic consideration of His Majesty's Government and be read a second time. Perhaps I ought to add that the Bill itself is not
<col>702</col>
my handiwork. The author of the Bill is Mr. Wolff, an acknowledged authority on these matters, whose experience is second to none. And in that direction might I say that if your Lordships really want to get an intimate knowledge of the whole matter, you could not do better than read the book which has just been published by Mr. Wolff on "People's Banks"&#x2014;a most admirable contribution to the whole subject. I thank your Lordships for listening to me so patiently, and I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time.&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01577">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Shaftesbury.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01578"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support the Motion of my noble friend Lord Shaftesbury, and as I have had some experience in the creation and promotion of agricultural banks, both in India and in Ireland, perhaps the few remarks I shall make may not be altogether undeserving of your attention. In the year 1898, after the United Provinces of India had begun to recover from the severe famine which had afflicted them during two years, the Government of India were confronted with the problem of how the self-reliance of the people might be stimulated and how they might be brought to confront another famine otherwise than through reliance upon the charity of the State.<lb/>
Some time before inquiries had been instituted in the Madras Presidency as to the possibility of creating Raffeissen banks in India, and a very careful and exhaustive report was prepared by Sir William Nicholson, who had made the subject his own. But no practical steps were taken upon that report, and it was not until the beginning of 1898 that any action was taken. At that time Mr. Dupernix, one of the clever young officers who had served during the famine, wrote a book which immediately arrested attention in Northern India. I asked Lord Curzon to allow me to place Mr. Dupernix on special service for the purpose of carrying into effect the doctrines which he preached, and Lord Curzon, who was ever ready to receive any suggestions tending to improve the material lot of the Indian ryot, at once agreed. The credit for any result which followed must be entirely attributed to Mr. Dupernix
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0377"/>
<col>703</col>
and the gentlemen who were associated with him. They commenced to establish banks, a propaganda was set on foot to explain to the Indian ryots and the zemindars concerned what the objects in view were, a large number of provisional banks were created and rules were tentatively drawn up for putting them into operation.<lb/>
In those early days it was, of course, impossible to obtain from the people themselves the necessary funds to finance such an operation, and consequently the Government, which at the time was in my hands, advanced the small sum of 5,000 rupees, or about &#x00A3;300, to give to these banks a small capital with which to commence their work. Shortly afterwards I left India, but I have watched the growth of the movement. The last figures which I have had access to are those contained in the Indian Statistical Abstract for the year 1908, and they show that the operations which commenced ten years before with a little over &#x00A3;300 capital had increased to &#x00A3;430,000. The operations appealed to the people, both landlords and tenants, and I do not think that any more beneficent work was ever instituted in India than these Raffeissen banks. I must be permitted to re-echo the words of my noble friend Lord Shaftesbury in saying that to Lord Curzon is due the credit for having watched these banks in their infancy, for having nursed them in their adolescence, and, finally, for having appointed a Commission which carefully went over the whole ground and proposed the Bill which afterwards became the Indian Act of 1904.<lb/>
When I went to Ireland I found that these banks were also in operation there, but they were languishing. They were languishing, I believe, for the reasons which caused the Indian banks in the commencement to languish. The reasons were these, that the Indian banks, as also the Irish banks, were not incorporated, that the clumsy and cumbrous system of trustees was maintained, that the financing of the banks was not entrusted to the banks themselves but placed in the hands of outside capitalists. These defects were removed by Lord Curzon's Act, and these are the defects which it is now proposed to remove by the Bill which my noble friend has introduced to your Lordships. The
<col>704</col>
Bill is an extremely simple one, based upon the Friendly Societies Act of 1896. It merely asks your Lordships to approve of three principles&#x2014;first, of the principle of incorporation; secondly, of the principle of creating a central institution for the purpose of financing the banks; and, thirdly, of the principle of granting to these banks the power of trading.<lb/>
In regard to the first of these principles, that of incorporation, I do not suppose that anybody would prefer that these banks should continue on their present basis and employ trustees while incorporation could be employed. In the Indian Act registration carries with it <i>de facto</i> the incorporation of the bank, and no evil effects whatever have resulted therefrom. In regard to the creation of a central institution, I consider it is all-important. Where you have a number of banks scattered over a large area you must have some poor and some rich banks. The proposal is to create a central bank in which the agricultural banks can take shares, and into which they can pay their deposits, which would then be used for financing the smaller banks without any recourse to outside financial assistance. The principle is entirely consistent with the theory of co-operative banks; it looks to the members of the bank to find the funds necessary for the bank's operations. The granting of permission to trade is also a necessary corollary of the creation of the banks. If banks are allowed to make advances for agricultural purposes there is no reason why they should not also provide agricultural appliances such as seed and better manure, which are also essential for agricultural purposes. When you get so far it is but a very small step to allow these small credit associations among the poor the same liberty of trading that you allow to the large co-operative societies among the rich. These, my Lords, are the few remarks which I desire to address to the House. I trust that you will look upon the Bill with favour, because it will be productive, especially in Ireland, of great advantages to the agricultural population.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01579"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with great interest to the words which fell from the noble Earl who moved the Second Reading, because I have myself given some attention to this Bill, and I very soon discovered that it was a difficult measure
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0378"/>
<col>705</col>
to understand. So far as I can gather&#x2014;and I look at it, I must say, rather from the commercial attitude than from any other&#x2014;under this Bill certain men may bind themselves together under the Friendly Societies Act; they may call themselves a bank; they may lend each other money; they do not trade for profit; they can take deposits from the public. The Bill does not say what they are to allow on those deposits, or whether the deposits will be forthcoming. In my experience, deposits are things of very slow growth, and there are many attendant circumstances surrounding a bank that takes money on deposit which have to be inquired into. I do not gather whether the liability is to be limited or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01580"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: In the case of small banks it would be unlimited, but the central bank would have limited responsibility.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01581"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: That is rather difficult to understand. I have referred to the smaller aspects of the question. I now come to a rather more important one. Clause 4 provides that a thrift and credit bank may, if the rules of the society so permit, borrow money from any county council. Let us look at the other side of the question. Is the county council to have power to lend money to these banks? If so, what rate is it going to charge, what interest is it going to demand? I need hardly remind your Lordships that all of us who are ratepayers are more or less concerned. We are shareholders in the county council, and would like to know whether county councils are to be in a position to lend money to these banks. Speaking from a commercial point of view I have no hesitation in saying that from 1880 till now the lending of money merely on agricultural land has been a dangerous proceeding to the lender unless the margin has been very large. All these matters depend on the price of produce. The price of produce has been low until the last year or two. Land banks, small holdings, and agriculture all depend on the price of produce. Fortunately, in the last few years the price of produce has gone up and is likely to keep up, because, after all, land is only a fixed quantity while population is far from being a fixed quantity.<lb/>
We cannot, however, compare for one moment the state of things in France and
<col>706</col>
Germany with the agricultural position in this country. We have to deal with two great factors. One is climate and the other is protection. As regards France, the climate of that country, of three-fourths of it at any rate, is a great deal better for agriculture than this country. As regards protection&#x2014;I am not now arguing whether we are right or wrong&#x2014;for better or for worse we in this country have long since come to the conclusion that the dwellers in the towns are to have the cheapest food that can be given to them. Agriculture and landlords have been allowed to take care of themselves. The effect both on agriculture and on landlords during the last thirty years has been very disastrous. That is the position to-day in this country. We give cheap food to the towns, but we do not look after the country. In France and Germany the exact converse is the case. France and Germany, for better or worse, have considered it right to protect their agricultural industry. They put 10<i>s</i>. or 12<i>s</i>. on wheat, and agriculture has done better under those circumstances than it has here. Their system has been the opposite to our own, and therefore these banks are able to succeed in Germany and in France. It is all a question of the price of produce. I should have thought that it would not have passed the wit of man to decide on some policy which would give cheap food to the towns and also a little help to agriculturists by such a system as the bounty system on home produce. But this is not the moment to discuss that matter.<lb/>
I think it might be possible for the Government to take this matter up and finance this land bank system. I am not sure that they would be able to do it. We have in our minds the attempt of the late Government to start a large purchase scheme for Ireland. I always thought there would be difficulty there, because after all the Government were borrowing money at two and three-quarters per cent and lending it at three and a-quarter per cent., and I could not see, that there was sufficient margin for contingencies. As a matter of fact, contingencies occurred; but, curiously enough, the matter arose in this way&#x2014;that the Government could no longer borrow the money at two and three-quarters per cent.; they have had to pay more for it, and therefore they are in the awkward position of having to give nearly as much for the money as
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0379"/>
<col>707</col>
the men to whom they lend it give them, and they have to run all the risks. Therefore, I do not think even the Government, unless they were very careful of the way in which the measure was framed, Would be able to carry out a measure of this sort. Banks in India are not on the same footing at all. Those banks were started to guard the natives from the world-wide rapacity of the Indian moneylender. They were inaugurated for that object and they have done well; but there is not that mischief to contend with here. I am ignorant enough not to have known that there were such things as land banks in Ireland, but they do not seem to have been on any large scale. I understand that the funds amount to &#x00A3;48,000.</membercontribution></p>

If agriculture is not doing well here, it cannot be made to do well by banding men together in the way proposed; and that is why I say that these banks under this sort of auspices are dangerous. Nothing effective would be able to be done unless the price of produce becomes much higher than it is to-day. I do not propose to vote against the Second Reading of the Bill, but I shall listen with interest to the criticisms that will be made upon it in the course of this discussion and in the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01584"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was relieved to hear the noble Lord conclude his speech by saying that he does not intend to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, because from the general character of his remarks his criticisms were somewhat searching, and he seemed, I regret to find, to regard these little banks with a good deal of suspicion&#x2014;approaching them, as he frankly told us, from a commercial point of view. The noble Lord is obviously unaware of the peculiar circumstances under which Raffeissen banks were started in Ireland. With the permission of the House, I should like to say a few words just to give my own experience, because I have one in my own village and I know a great deal about the general movement which gave rise to the formation of these banks in the poorer
<col>708</col>
districts in the West of Ireland. Towards the end of his remarks the noble Lord put aside the case of India because he said that in India you had to contend with the rapacity of the moneylender. That was exactly the state of things that we had to face in the West of Ireland, and which suggested to Sir Horace Plunkett and others who were working with him that this system which had performed such wonders in Germany should be tried in Ireland, and tried it has been with great success. As a proof of that, there is the fact that some 300 of these societies have been started, and I can assure the noble Lord that they have done a very great amount of good.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord seemed to think that these were land banks, that they were for the purpose of lending money on the security of the land. These things are on a much smaller and humbler scale altogether. It is rather to enable a poor man to buy a pig than to enable a farmer to buy a large tract of land. The loans are chiefly of a small character. The noble Lord had some doubts whether the deposits would be forthcoming. Of course, when a bank is started in a very poor neighbourhood deposits are not forthcoming at first. That is the reason why, as Lord MacDonnell pointed out, they have to be financed at the outset. That is, of course, a difficulty, and you want some outside help for that purpose; but once they have established themselves and lent money in these small sums, and those operations have been remunerative, they do begin to attract deposits, and the savings of the district are in that way retained in the district and fructify there, and are of great advantage to the community. The noble Lord questioned whether it was advisable to give power to these banks to borrow from county councils. So far as my Irish experience goes, I do not think that that is of very vital importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01585"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that. I said I did not know whether it was right for the county council to lend to them, not whether it was right for them to borrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01586"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord made quite clear what his meaning was. I do not know whether county councils in Ireland have power to lend or not, but I do not think it is material one way or the other. The banks so far
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0380"/>
<col>709</col>
have been able to struggle along, and with the help of the Department of Agriculture, which has given them the small sums necessary as the nest-egg to start the thing, they have had no difficulty in making their first few steps, and once they are established they do attract the savings of the local community. As Lord Shaftesbury pointed out, in the case of one of the earliest banks started in Germany there was no less a sum than &#x00A3;2,000 accumulated in the form of a reserve fund. I do not think the question as to whether the Government should finance these banks is involved in this Bill, and therefore I need not touch upon that. But I should like to say, in conclusion, that, having watched these banks in various parts of the country for some years, and having one, as I say, in my own village in Ireland which is doing most excellent work and which very much requires the particular powers which this Bill seeks to confer and which have been so clearly explained by my noble friends Lord Shaftesbury and Lord Mac Donnell, I do very earnestly beg the House to give a Second Reading to this Bill and not place any difficulties in the way of its passing into law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01587"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that my noble friend Lord Denman, who generally represents His Majesty's Government in connection with Bills affecting the Treasury, is too unwell to be in his place this evening. I am the more sorry because he dealt with this subject when it came before your Lordships' House two years ago, and therefore would have been able to deal with it on the present occasion with real knowledge. But, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, I give what I think we gave two years ago, cordial approval to the principle of the Bill coupled with the desire to see certain Amendments introduced in it&#x2014;not, I think, a very unusual position for a Government Department to take up. There is no doubt, if only from the debate to which your Lordships have listened to-night, that the success of the banks which have been conducted on similar principles in Ireland, in Germany, and in India, really proves that we might expect great advantages from them if they were started in this country too.<lb/>
There is, of course, a great difficulty connected with the question of unlimited liability. I think it is quite clear that you
<col>710</col>
ought to have some kind of limitation introduced. If you do not limit the liability of individuals, then probably you ought to introduce a limitation with regard to area, so that all those who are connected with the society may know the financial position of the members and may be aware if any member is taking an unfair advantage of the money that has been lent to him or is at all likely to involve them in loss. I think that is a form of limitation that might be substituted for limited liability with regard to money. The question of county councils has already been partly dealt with in the Small Holdings and Allotments Act of 1908; and I think, with regard to other provisions in this Bill, that a considerable amount of the powers which are given in the Bill can already be exercised under somewhat similar circumstances. But in any case this Bill does, I am glad to know, incorporate some of the Amendments which were suggested by His Majesty's Government on the last occasion. Unfortunately it does not include them all, and it is obvious, from what fell from Lord Faber, that the matter does require some further consideration. The noble Lord, I think, Was the only one who spoke with first-hand knowledge of banking affairs, and it is quite clear that it is desirable that the Bill should be examined from that point of view.<lb/>
The suggestion, therefore, which I should like to make to the noble Earl is that this Bill should be read a second time this evening, and should then be referred to a Select Committee which could inquire thoroughly into the subject, and whose Report might form the basis of a Bill to be introduced on another occasion either by His Majesty's Government or by a private individual. I hope the noble Earl will not consider that such a step is in the direction of shelving the matter, because within the last few years the Reports of Select Committees appointed to consider Bills of this kind have very often, if not generally, led to legislation on a subsequent occasion. I venture to hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will see his way to adopt that suggestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01588"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as this is a matter to which I have given some attention in the past, I should like to make one or two observations upon this Bill. I do not think, in dealing with this matter, that we can lay much stress on experience in India or in Germany. In
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0381"/>
<col>711</col>
countries like that there are not the facilities for loans being obtained from banks that there are in England or in Scotland, particularly in Scotland, or even in Ireland, but I do not think that is any reason for objecting to the principle of this Bill. I have no doubt there are cases, and perhaps many cases, in which banks of this kind may be extremely useful to depositors and to those who desire to take loans from them, but that the subject is one of considerable difficulty and complication I think has been admitted both by the noble Earl who introduced the Bill and by the noble Lord opposite who seconded the Motion for the Second Reading.<lb/>
The suggestion made by the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, that these banks might be in some measure a substitute for the Post Office Savings Bank, is one which I confess does not seem to me to be practicable. He told your Lordships that lately there had been a movement among those who deposit their money in the Post Office Savings Bank in favour of utilising that bank rather by way of current accounts than of deposits for any length of time. If that be so, it would be very dangerous for persons to put their money into banks of the kind proposed in this Bill, which are instituted largely in order to give loans to small farmers which would almost necessarily be given for some considerable time, with the idea that they could withdraw it as quickly as they could from the Post Office Savings Bank. That is one point. Another is the security of loans. I agree very much with the noble Earl who has just sat down. You must have local knowledge on the part of those who manage these banks of the persons to whom they make the loans.<lb/>
There has been, in England at any rate, a considerable change in the last twenty years in local banking. I can remember the working thirty years ago and more of my county bank, and in those days it was universal almost for country banking in England to be conducted much more by personal knowledge than anything else. There has been of late years an enormous absorption of these small country banks by large London institutions, and the result has been that much of that personal knowledge has disappeared and you have to conduct banking in the country much more on the London system of obtaining security for
<col>712</col>
your loans than on personal knowledge of the persons borrowing. Then also there has been what my noble friend Lord Faber has alluded to with great truth&#x2014;a considerable falling off in the value of produce until quite recently, which has depressed agriculture and done much injury to owners and occupiers. All these things have to be taken into consideration; therefore I would venture to say that the only safeguard of a proposal of this kind is that personal knowledge which can only be secured by lending money to people in the immediate neighbourhood of those who manage the bank.<lb/>
I am glad the noble Earl who spoke on behalf of His Majesty's Government has made the suggestion that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. I think it is the only way in which so complicated a subject can be properly dealt with, and if in that Committee the authors of the Bill are favoured with suggestions from His Majesty's Government for the more safe working of the measure, I hope they will accept them. I look myself with some doubt on granting power to trade. Banking is one thing; trading is quite another; and unless that is limited in some way I can conceive that great difficulties might arise in the future in the management of these institutions. So far as the Second Reading goes, I entirely support the Motion, and I think the House is very much indebted to the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, for the extremely clear and lucid statement in which he explained the provisions of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01589"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as far as the suggestion that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee is concerned, I see no objection whatever to it. I think it would be an admirable course to adopt, and I am quite sure that then the merits of the Bill would be thoroughly discussed and any Amendments that were required could be very easily introduced. On the question of unlimited liability, I quite appreciate the point that has been raised. It is obvious that if you are going to have unlimited liability amongst the members, you should restrict the liability in other ways. It could, I think, be restricted in the amount of the loans and in point of area; but that can be done when the Bill is before the Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01594"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has moved a Motion to which I believe there will be universal assent, but I desire to make one or two remarks upon it. I myself am prepared to give him the heartiest support in this matter, but I wish to point out the great advantage of the procedure which the noble Lord has gone through this evening. This Bill was pressed upon the House of Commons by the last Government, and much pressure was put upon the Government of the day from the Opposition side of the House to introduce this particular provision into the Bill&#x2014;that military man&#x0153;uvres should not be carried out except after an Order in Council had been made and that Order in Council had been the subject of a Motion of this character. I do not think it will be beside the question to point out that this particular provision, inserted at the instance of those who now form the Government, is one which your Lordships have asked for on more than one occasion in much more important Bills, in order to check much wider powers given to a Minister than those which the noble Lord is putting into force on this occasion. Not only so; there is an intermediate stage. It is quite possible to put into an Act of Parliament, and it has been done in many Acts of Parliament, the provision that an Order in Council should be made and should take effect if no Motion adverse to it is raised within forty days. That action has been pressed for on many occasions, but has been refused to us by those who now form the Government; and all we have been allowed on several occasions when it was necessary to make some concession was that the Order in Council should lie on the Table without any power to your Lordships'
<col>714</col>
House or the other House of Parliament of checking it.<lb/>
I think it is important, in view of recent legislation, to call attention to the extraordinary divergence between precept and practice on the part of those who are now responsible. Last November your Lordships pressed upon the Government that the enormous powers which were given to the President of the Local Government Board to over-ride the elected representatives of the ratepayers in a number of matters which might run to millions of money should at least have the check upon them of being laid on the Table and made the subject of a possible Motion within forty days in your Lordships' House or the other House of Parliament. But that was refused&#x2014;I must say I think unreasonably refused&#x2014;and I would ask the noble Lord to tell us whether there has been any occasion on which obstruction has taken place or any attempt has been made in either House of Parliament unreasonably or vexatiously to use the time of the House in order to discuss a Motion of this character. I myself had to carry a similar Motion on several occasions, and I found that it was received in an admirable spirit. I realise that in the great pressure of Parliamentary business it is necessary that much wider powers should be given to heads of Departments than have been given hitherto, because it is impossible to carry an annual Bill on many points which have hitherto been the subject of annual Bills; but, if you do give this power, I think the provision which the noble Lord is putting into force to-night is the negation, and the necessary negation, of the bureaucratic powers which strike at the whole popular control if they are to be in the hands of Ministers in charge of Departments without this sort of salutary check. I have only ventured to call your Lordships' attention to this because I think that this provision is an illustration of the sounder views which prevailed among noble Lords opposite when they were not responsible for the Government of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01595"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRTVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount is entirely within his right in calling attention to this particular provision, but I do not know that he is altogether justified in drawing from this provision the conclusion which he

appears to draw, that on practically all other occasions in which an administrative discretion is given to a Department that discretion should be subject to possible review on the part of either or both Houses of Parliament. In this particular case leave to hold man&#x0153;uvres in a particular part of England is a matter of importance, and I think it is one which is very properly subject to Parliamentary control. As various Bills come before us there may be other subjects of which the same may properly be said; but at all events there are subjects of a different class and of altogether minor importance, in which we think, as we have shown once or twice during the past two or three sessions, that it is not necessary to trouble Parliament with their review. Each case, I think, must be taken on its merits. This case we should all agree is one where the mere discretion of the Department is not sufficient. As I say, there may be many other such cases; but we are not prepared, both on the ground of principle and on the ground of general convenience, to accept the proposition that all administrative actions ought to be subject to some control.<lb/>

<title>HOWELL'S CHARITY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01596"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to move that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying him to withhold his assent to the scheme under the Welsh Intermediate Education Act which relates to the Denbigh Share of Howell's Charity for Girls' Schools in Wales, I must remind the House that a scheme practically identical with the present one was rejected by this House in July, 1897, upon a Resolution moved by the late Archbishop Temple. That rejection was supported by the late Marquess of Salisbury, who, at infinite pains, had gone into the whole history and details of this school and endowment.<lb/>
This scheme relates to the share of Howell's Charity which belongs to the school named after him at Denbigh. This charity was founded in 1540 by Thomas Howell to provide marriage portions for maidens being orphans, with priority to his own kindred. The Drapers' Company
<col>716</col>
were appointed under his will the trustees and administrators of this charity. Claimants for the benefit of this charity were to produce a certificate of their kinship to the founder from the Bishop of Llandaff, or, if the See were vacant, from the Dean and Chapter of the same diocese in which Monmouthshire, the home of the Howell family, is situated. The charity grew greatly in value, and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1852 empowering the Court of Chancery to extend the said charity to the establishment, maintenance, and benefit of schools in Wales for the instruction of girls, and maintaining, clothing, and providing portions for the orphan inmates educated in the schools so established. The Court of Chancery, acting upon the doctrine of <i>cy-pr&#x00E8;s</i>, considered that if the money was more than enough for the original purpose of the founder, the remainder should be spent in educating children, especially orphans. In accordance with this scheme Howell's School was established for North Wales, and Denbigh Was selected as a central position.<lb/>
The school was opened in 1860. Religious instruction was to be given in accordance with the principles of the Church of England, and so it has continued until the present time; but the acceptance of that religious instruction is entirely voluntary, and the children go either to Church or to Chapel, as their parents or guardians desire. The provision of the scheme on this point runs thus:&#x2014;
<quote>"But the said schools and establishments shall be open to female children of parents of all religious tenets, and no child shall be required to learn the Catechism of the Church of England in case her parents or next friends shall express in writing to the governors their objections, on conscientious grounds, to her doing so, and in all other respects the religious scruples of the parents and guardians shall be respected."</quote>
During the twenty years that I have been chairman of the governing body there has not been a single case of any complaint or difficulty touching the religious instruction in the school. It is clear from the founder's will that he was a man of very definite religious convictions. But 370 years is a long time ago, and I do not now, nor did I in 1897, argue for the rejection of this scheme merely on this ground. I can say without hesitation that there has been no sectarian bias or preference shown in the management of this school. In proof of that statement stands the fact that at present half the day scholars are the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0384"/>
<col>717</col>
children of Nonconformists. No inquiry is made as to the religious belief of children entering the school, and I am only able to give this denominational figure in reference to the day scholars, because it happens that as residents in the town and neighbourhood the religious persuasion of their parents is known. With regard to the boarders, no inquiry whatever is made on this point, the only personal detail given in the application being the occupation of the father; and looking over the applications of the last five or six years, I find that there were eighteen applications for the admission of children of clergymen, of whom nine were elected, while during the same period there were seven applications for the admission of children of Nonconformist Ministers, of whom six were elected. Among the day scholars in the school was the daughter of a Nonconformist Minister who resides in Denbigh and deservedly occupies a distinguished position in the principality.<lb/>
The local governors are appointed by the Drapers' Company, and to those who know the splendid work done by this Company in the promotion of higher education, this fact itself is ample security for the impartiality and the competence of the local governors. But while I repudiate the existence of any sectarian bias in the administration of this school, I recognise that religious instruction has always occupied a secure and an adequate position in its curriculum, and this fact is, I know, one of the reasons why entrance into the school is so eagerly sought for by Nonconformists as well as Churchmen. In 1897 I supported the rejection of the scheme largely on educational grounds. I consider that those grounds to-day, more than ever, not only justify but demand the rejection of this scheme. The scheme now laid on your Lordships' Table proposes to make this a Denbigh county school, to be graded as a public elementary school. Here let me point out that Howell's School was established for the whole of North Wales and was not limited to the county of Denbigh, and for this limitation there is no justification either in history or in justice. Not a farthing of its endowment comes from Denbighshire or from anyone remotely connected with Denbighshire. The accident of its position is the only claim which the county of Denbigh can make to this school. This fact is tacitly admitted in the scheme itself by the constitution of the proposed governing body.<lb/>
<col>718</col>
It will be observed that the scheme gives a preference to residents in the counties of Denbigh and Flint. I ask the House to notice particularly this point. If these two counties have a co-equal claim to this school, it is important to remember that while the County Council of Denbighshire are the promoters of this scheme, the County Council of Flintshire are as strongly opposed to it and in favour of its rejection.<lb/>
The transformation proposed in the scheme means the educational degradation of the school. I desire to make this point quite clear. The Welsh Intermediate Education Act, in the administration of which I have been privileged to take a considerable part, resulted in the unforeseen appropriation of most of our old grammar schools by the county authorities. This appropriation was in the majority of cases an educational disaster. Llandovery and Brecon Schools, happily saved from that appropriation, are to-day not only incomparably the best schools in Wales, but take a high rank among the public schools of England. I recognise that the county schools are doing useful Work, but they suffer from a cast-iron uniformity and educationally provide a purely secondary education. The promoters of this scheme aim at a rigid conformity in type, whereas nonconformity in type is essential to a system which desires to meet the educational needs of the whole community. To reduce Howell's School to a level with, and to make it an exact copy of, the numerous secondary schools in Wales would be not only to destroy its primary purpose, but to eliminate a high school at present separate and almost alone, and one which performs the most useful educational work. A thing may be good though not the same, and better because not the same.<lb/>
It may be asked how far does the history of Howell's School since the rejection of the scheme thirteen years ago, justify these statements. In 1897 the staff of the school consisted of a headmistress and six governesses. Not one member of that staff held any University qualification or any of those educational certificates now considered essential for such a position. The present staff consists of eleven resident mistresses, the headmistress being a graduate in honours of London University and formerly senior mathematical lecturer at Westfield College. Four of the assistant
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0385"/>
<col>719</col>
mistresses are graduates in honours from London, Aberdeen, and Victoria Universities, two have taken honours at Oxford and Cambridge, two are licentiates of the Royal Academy of Music, one holds the art class teachers' certificate, and one comes from the Anstey Physical Training College. These ladies, who are especially competent to appreciate the educational changes proposed in this scheme, have notified their intention of leaving the school if the scheme is passed; the reason for that determination is in no sense denominational, but they feel that the transformation of the school into a county school would make it impossible for them to continue in their positions without a serious sacrifice of professional or educational <i>status</i>. During the last five years sixteen pupils in this school have passed the London Matriculation, four have gained scholarships, fourteen have gone on to University work, and five are now preparing for University scholarships, and to this list might be added a large number of other honours, but enough has been said to show that this school is doing excellent work which no other girls' school in Wales is attempting. If this scheme were passed that work would be rudely interrupted. In 1897 the numbers in the school were eighty; they are now 138, and the urgent need of the school to-day, for which there are abundant funds, is the carrying out of the new buildings approved by the Drapers' Company. The Drapers' Company, competent and unbiassed judges, exercise a close supervision over this school. They visit and inspect the school regularly, and they are among the strenuous opponents of this scheme. If the case for the rejection of this scheme in 1897 was strong, it is infinitely stronger to-day, and I ask the House to repeat the verdict which they then gave&#x2014;a verdict abundantly justified by the educational results since achieved by this school as a consequence of that rejection.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01598"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is unfortunate that the right rev. Prelate should have moved the rejection of this
<col>720</col>
scheme and not have indicated, in the event of the scheme being rejected, any suggestions he might have to make for a settlement of this question. I have not the slightest doubt that, not only in Denbighshire but in North Wales generally, substantial benefits would be derived from this scheme, and it would be welcomed. The representative governors are not limited in the scheme to Denbighshire or Flintshire; all the counties in North Wales are to be represented on the new governing body, and the scholarships are to be open to the whole of North Wales. The right rev. Prelate referred to this school as a high school. It is also in a sense a charity school. The right rev. Prelate very properly laid no great stress on the religious views of the founder, because the founder at that time would have been subject by law to execution if he had not believed in the seven sacraments. Therefore when the Court of Chancery attached this school to the Church of England I do not think it can be considered that they were giving any effect to the will of the founder.<lb/>
I take exception to the suggestion made by the right rev. Prelate that this scheme would result in the degradation of the school from a high school to a secondary school. In the general language of the Charity Commission and the Board of Education I do not know that there is any distinction between a high school and a secondary school. Everything between the elementary school and the University is classed as secondary education. I see by this scheme that the ordinary leaving age is fixed at seventeen; yet any scholar whom the headmistress thinks fit to continue may remain in the school up to the age of nineteen. Therefore it is clear that the course of education which may be given up to the age of nineteen covers all that we include in secondary education. The right rev. Prelate did not tell us the age of the present scholars in the school, and what is the usual leaving age.</membercontribution></p>

<col>721</col>
of the Welsh county schools, which, notwithstanding sparse population and small numbers, are doing excellent work, and do send to the University a large number of their students who do credit to themselves there. I do not think it can be suggested that if the changes contemplated in the scheme were to come into effect you would lower the class of teaching in this school or get a smaller proportion of the students to go on to the University. The school, no doubt, has been conducted in a liberal and fair way, and very nearly as many daughters of Nonconformist Ministers have secured scholarships as have been obtained by daughters of Ministers of the Church of England. We know that if a school in Wales is really to meet the wants of the neighbourhood it must liberally meet the feelings of the Nonconformist population, who are in a great majority.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate did not mention that in the present scheme under which the school is governed there is an obligation upon the whole of the teaching staff to sign a declaration that they are members of the Church of England. In a school where apparently half of the scholars are Nonconformist, and where there is this liberal provision that they can withdraw themselves from the Catechism and are at liberty to go to the place of worship of their family on the Sunday, there cannot be any necessity for requiring that the whole staff should be drawn from the Church of England. I had no notice that this Motion was coming on, and I have therefore not had an opportunity of putting myself in communication with the Denbighshire people, but we in North Wales are quite familiar with Howell's School. The question of its government has been before the public in previous years, and a similar scheme was rejected thirteen years ago. I believe that marriage portions and such things are a little antiquated. The school Would be more useful if the large endowments were made more available, and if you look at this scheme you will see that there is a very liberal provision of scholarships for poor children throughout the whole of North Wales. The school is an important one from its wealth and its handsome buildings, and, considering the nature of the population of North Wales, it would have won more confidence if some disposition had been shown to relax the exclusive method of selecting the staff.<lb/>
<col>722</col>
We are told that the Drapers' Company are opposed to this new scheme. I do not know that they have petitioned against it, but if the right rev. Prelate states from his knowledge that the Drapers' Company are opposed I take it to be so. In a country with a scattered population like that of North Wales it is an advantage that there should be one or two schools like this with largely the character of boarding schools. There has been great pressure from the Board of Education and from the Central Welsh Board to endeavour in the rural schools of North Wales to differentiate the curriculum and to earmark one or two schools as giving a more advanced education. There is no doubt that a great number of the children who go to the county schools in Wales are forced to leave between the ages of sixteen and seventeen, and if we could pick out some schools in which the curriculum should lead up to the University it would be a great gain, and it would be a greater gain still if we could make them boarding schools. Therefore I have no fault to find with this school retaining the character of a boarding school. I am glad to see that the scheme provides bursaries and provision for railway fares where such provision is necessary. Therefore I think the scheme is very well drawn, and I believe it would tend to make the school more available for the population of North Wales.<lb/>
I can understand a powerful and generous City Company, which have shown a keen interest in education, not liking interference with their prerogatives. Hitherto the Drapers' Company have governed the school, and this scheme brings in a large element of local representation. I cannot help thinking that perhaps some compromise might be effected by which the Drapers might have a stronger representation than is given in this scheme, and also a substantial admixture of local educational people might be secured. The scheme as founded by the Court of Chancery was a scheme for the benefit of North Wales, and I think it would be a good thing if the people of North Wales had substantial representation upon it. In so far as the school is a day school it will necessarily be a Denbighshire school in consequence of the limits of travelling. I suppose it is hopeless to divide the House, but we shall hear what His Majesty's Government have to say. The question ought not to be treated
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0387"/>
<col>723</col>
as a controversial one, but as a question of how best to make this substantial endowment beneficial to the people of North Wales. I know what a strong feeling there is in this matter, and I think it would be a pity, when the position of ecclesiastical parties in Wales is rather strained, that a conciliatory action should not be adopted. I therefore hope that if the scheme is rejected we may hear something indicating that we may look for a friendly settlement of this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01601"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has not given an altogether true version of the history of this school. This is a school in which the teaching of the Church of England has always been given. We have heard from the right rev. Prelate that the school has been conducted on absolutely liberal and impartial principles, and that a great number of Nonconformist children have been educated in the school. Not a single complaint has ever been made on the part of Nonconformists as to the education given. Surely the liberality with which the authorities have treated Nonconformist children should not be made a reason for practically destroying the religious teaching with which the school has always been associated. Imagine the case reversed. Suppose this had been an undenominational school and an attempt had been made to convert it into a denominational school. Would not the noble Lord be the firs to complain of such a proceeding? The action proposed is like that of the bird which appears at this season of the year, the cuckoo, which, after receiving kind treatment in another's nest, turns out the rightful owner. That is exactly what it is proposed to do in connection with this school. It would not only be unjust if this scheme were allowed to go through; it would not be to the advantage of higher education in Wales.<lb/>
I have looked through the debate which took place in 1897, and I would like to remind your Lordships how the late Lord Salisbury characterised the scheme of that day. Lord Salisbury said&#x2014;
<quote>"Under an appearance of educational reform we might really be conducting a scheme of theological piracy."</quote>
That is precisely what this scheme is. Under the Act your Lordships have a perfect right to veto the scheme if you think it unjust, and I am quite satisfied that nobody who
<col>724</col>
knows anything about the history of this school and the facts of the case will think that this scheme is otherwise than unjust. For is it conceivable that these highly-qualified teachers would have declared their intention to resign their places if they had supposed that the scheme proposed would be to the advantage of education or of North Wales generally?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01602"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not altogether clear on what grounds your Lordships are really asked to object to the scheme which is now before the House. When the right rev. Prelate who moved the Motion addressed us he laid no emphasis at all on the denominational side of the question. He left it rather severely alone; and it is only in the speech of the noble Viscount who has just sat down that that part of the question has been introduced. As it has been introduced I hope your Lordships will forgive me if I say something in the first place on that point.<lb/>
There was appointed in the year 1880 a Departmental Committee, of which the late Lord Aberdare was Chairman and Lord Cawdor was a member. That Committee inquired into the condition of intermediate education in Wales and the measures necessary for its improvement. The Committee reported that the Howell's Schools were founded by means of a charity originally bequeathed free from any denominational trusts, and that an educational character was first imprinted on the charity by the scheme of the Court of Chancery. The Court of Chancery directed the establishment of two female orphanages, and at the same time introduced provisions the practical effect of which has been to make the schools Church of England institutions. The Committee went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"In view of the terms of the original Foundation and the effect of certain provisions of the Endowed Schools Act the Howell School must be made wholly unsectarian, and similar changes appear to be called for in the constitution of the governing body."</quote>
That is a very conclusive statement which it seems the Committee had no hesitation whatever in making, and I hope it will have some influence on your Lordships to-night.<lb/>
Partly as the result of the Report of that Departmental Committee, the Intermediate Education Act of 1889 contained provisions affecting the powers of the Charity Commissioners and of the county
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0388"/>
<col>725</col>
councils in regard to various endowed educational institutions in Wales. The policy of that Act was to place certain powers in the hands of the county councils; and what your Lordships are really being asked to do this evening is to reverse, in regard to this particular institution, the policy of that Act, and without any exhaustive inquiry to refuse to allow the local authority, which in 1889 was considered worthy and capable, to exercise the power given at that time. We are often told that we ought to trust the men on the spot, and I hope on this occasion your Lordships will realise that these county councils, knowing a great deal about the needs of the localities, are well able to prepare a scheme such as is required by the neighbourhood.<lb/>
Reference has been made both by the right rev. Prelate and the noble Viscount who has just sat down to a debate which took place on a former occasion. A scheme very similar to that now before your Lordships was then defended by the late Duke of Devonshire, Lord President of the Council, and it is interesting to note that he had the support of one or two noble Lords who, I am afraid, are not often found in the Lobby with His Majesty's Government. I hope that in the Division which will take place to-night we shall have their support. There is this to be said in defence of the proposed scheme, that it is precisely similar to one concerning the Howell's School at Llandaff, to which no objection was taken and which passed through your Lordships' House. As to the provision made in this scheme with relation to the religious side of education, I do not think it possible, granted that a scheme is to be made, for any other provisions to be made under the Welsh Intermediate Education Act. I think it should be obvious to your Lordships, since this endowment is applicable to secondary education in the county of Denbigh, that the county council should certainly have considerable influence on the governing body, and that influence is to be shared under the present scheme by various other county councils.<lb/>
I would be the last person to suggest, and I am sure nobody connected with the Education Office would wish to suggest, that the present education given at this school is not excellent; but it is not impossible that benefit may ensue from extending the education to a larger class of
<col>726</col>
girls than receive it at present. If that is the result, as we believe it to be the object of the scheme, I venture to hope that your Lordships will not oppose its passage on the present occasion. The only objection which came from the right rev. Prelate who moved the rejection of the scheme is that the school would be turned from a high school into a secondary school. In the circumstances the best answer is that the presumption is that the school as it should be and as it is likely to be of advantage to the people in the neighbourhood can be better judged by the county council and the joint intermediate committee which drew up this scheme. And as they were the body to whom under the Welsh Intermediate Education Act the duty of drawing up a scheme was entrusted, I venture to hope your Lordships will not interfere with the scheme they have drawn up and which we believe to be needed by the people in that neighbourhood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01603"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a few words before we come to a decision. Speaking for myself, I am not ordinarily at all in favour of fussy or restless interference on the part of either House of Parliament with schemes which are drawn up by educational authorities, either central or local, upon whom rests the responsibility for such schemes. It frequently happens that some charity or institution of an educational kind requires to be readjusted to meet existing circumstances, and the responsibility then devolves upon the authority, local or central, to draw up a scheme for doing what they regard as necessary; and in such cases it seems to me that the <i>onus probandi</i> rests entirely upon those Who object to the scheme which the local or central authority, in the exercise of their undoubted responsibility, are called upon to prepare.<lb/>
But the case is surely entirely different where an institution, scholastic or other, which is going on with perfect success and satisfactorily is suddenly called upon to stand and deliver, to give up the <i>status</i> which it at present possesses and to be reconstituted under a scheme which comes, so to speak, out of the blue sky. In that case the <i>onus probandi</i> rests entirely upon those who desire to make the change. They must show that there is some reason for a new departure of that kind, that something has gone wrong, that somebody
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0389"/>
<col>727</col>
is aggrieved, that some demand, extremely weighty, is being made of a sort which it would be unfair to resist, and that therefore an institution which is now doing good work must be interfered with and changed. I have listened in vain to-night for the slightest evidence that there is any reason for making a change in this case. I have not heard of a single person taking exception to the present conduct of the school. If I did hear of a single person being aggrieved I should wish to look most carefully at all the facts before I resisted an endeavour to set right a grievance which had thus been pointed out; but I find nothing of that kind alleged.<lb/>
Those in favour of this scheme do not deny that the school is doing admirable work, and that it is prepared to extend its buildings because the demand is large for that increase. The children of Nonconformist Ministers are welcomed within its walls and are there finding all that they desire, and not a trace has been pointed out to us of any difficulty or objection. One argument used in favour of the scheme by the noble Earl who spoke on behalf of His Majesty's Government was that such a plan would be in accordance with the Act of 1889 for promoting intermediate education in Wales. I hold that Act in my hand. It says it shall be the duty of the education committee of the county to submit schemes and to specify the way in which the educational endowments in the county ought to be used for the purpose of such schemes. Can that properly be made to apply to a boarding school so non-local as this is? The noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, is a distinguished alumnus of Eton. Eton College lies in Buckinghamshire. If the Welsh Act were made applicable to England, would the noble Earl say that it was desirable that the county of Bucks should prepare a scheme for upsetting existing arrangements and starting a new school? That is an extreme case to take, but it is not totally different in kind from what is here proposed. As a matter of fact, no part of the endowment of this school is derived from Denbighshire itself.<lb/>
The County Council of Denbighshire desire to make this change, for what reason I do not completely understand; the County Council of Flintshire, the other county interested, is equally strongly opposed to the change. In these circumstances is there
<col>728</col>
really ground for upsetting an institution which holds the position held by this school to-day? I think it will be agreed that we have good ground for opposing the scheme unless it can be shown that something is wrong or that religiously, educationally, or socially the change would be a gain. It has been pointed out that this scheme proposes to deal with an endowment existing in Denbighshire correspondingly with the treatment that was given some years ago to a school at Llandaff which drew its endowments from the same source and that that change has worked well. I do not know enough of the details to contradict that last statement, but I should be a little surprised to find&#x2014;indeed I think I can say that the contrary is the case&#x2014;that there has been no deterioration in the character of the education given in the school at Llandaff which was correspondingly changed in its character some years ago.<lb/>
I regard this project as an example of a somewhat pedantic desire for uniformity on the part of a county council, which not unnaturally would like to have mainly under its control institutions which exist within its borders although their funds are derived from elsewhere. I not only think that this is a somewhat unfair demand, but I believe that to give effect to such a desire would be distinctly harmful from an educational point of view. We have been in recent educational discussions pressing the great advantage on educational grounds of having a variety of type of schools under different kinds of regulation and under varied forms of control. I believe that the endeavour to reduce to a level of uniformity all schools of a higher grade character that are in a particular area is not only not necessary but is harmful and detrimental to educational interests. Our foremost living authority, Professor Sadler, is never tired of emphasising the gain that comes to a county or neighbourhood from possessing various types of schools. If in this case there could be shown sufficient ground for asking for a change I should be ready with all my heart to consider how the grievance ought to be met or how the difficulty could be overcome, but to be told, because the secondary schools in Wales are at present doing splendid work which we all admire, that therefore another school not belonging at present to that category is to be brought within it, and that we are to do that in face of the fact
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0390"/>
<col>729</col>
that the highly-skilled teachers within its walls feel the contrast to be so great that they would not continue to serve on its staff&#x2014;that is a proposition which seems to call for more reason for making a change than we have heard to-night. I hope your Lordships will decline to give sanction to this scheme, not because of anything mischievous within it but because no necessity whatever has been shown for making the change.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01604"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think I ought to say a few words in reply to what has been said by the most rev. Primate. I do not know whether any of your Lordships have taken the trouble to look back at the debate which took place on this subject in 1897, but those who have done so or who carry remembrance of it in their minds will realise that it assumed a very different character from the debate which has taken place this afternoon. On that occasion the scheme was moved by the then Lord President of the Council, the Duke of Devonshire; it was a scheme similar in character to this, and it was objected to by the Archbishop of Canterbury and by other speakers, including, I think, the noble Viscount opposite, solely on the ground that it was taking away from the Church of England something which belonged to it. No educational argument, so far as I can remember, was employed in that debate, except by the President of the Council, who was then responsible for education. The Prime Minister (the late Lord Salisbury), however, moved by the arguments&#x2014;the religious arguments&#x2014;put forward from the Right Rev. Bench, threw over his own Lord President, with the result that the scheme was discarded. That was an unusual operation to take place on the Front Bench, and in some cases I should have imagined might even have led to the resignation of the Minister responsible for the Department. But no such result followed, and the scheme was thrown out.<lb/>
To-day we have had a different series of arguments. The argument, however, which was so freely employed in 1897 was again pressed home by the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, and in view of that I think it is important to consider what the history of this charity really is. It is not the case of a pious founder whose wishes are, as we sometimes hear in other cases, to be over-ridden in obedience to new-fangled ideas in regard to education. There is no
<col>730</col>
evidence that the founder was pious. I hope he may have been; but what he did on this occasion was to set apart a considerable sum of money. I think the amount in the coinage of the time was rather over 8,000 ducats&#x2014;a sum of &#x00A3;4,000; and he set that sum apart for the benefit of orphan girls of his family. Unlike the famous character in the "Merchant of Venice" who lamented the simultaneous disappearance of his daughter and his ducats, he devoted the ducats to his daughters and to his future female descendants. Not only was there nothing denominational in his legacy but there was nothing educational, and it was not until well on into the nineteenth century that the charity or bequest assumed an educational form at all.<lb/>
It is not worth while to discuss the question how it was that at that time the Court of Chancery placed the bequest in the hands of the Church of England. That would involve an historical disquisition; but at any rate I confess I do not quite understand what fell from the right rev. Prelate as to the rule of <i>cy-pr&#x00E8;s</i>, of which we used to hear so much in the debates on the Education Bill, having brought about that particular result, because I cannot see that, so far as the terms of the original bequest are concerned, the Church of England was involved in any way whatever. It is quite true that this school conducted on Church of England lines has been conducted in a liberal and tolerant spirit. We may be quite sure that if the right rev. Prelate has anything to do with its management it certainly would be so. That has not been disputed. But I think, on the point of view of what is called theological piracy, it is relevant to ask what is the particular claim of the Church of England on this large foundation as compared with the claim of any other religious denomination? The fact to which attention was drawn by my noble friend behind me, Lord Sheffield, that not merely the headmistress but all the mistresses of the school have to declare themselves members of the Church of England&#x2014;a fact which was not commented on by the right rev. Prelate although I think it is worthy of consideration&#x2014;does undoubtedly stamp a special denominational character upon the school which in our opinion it ought not to bear, and I take it that at any rate some change in those arrangements was contemplated by the Committee of which the noble Earl,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0391"/>
<col>731</col>
Lord Cawdor, was a member, when they stated that in their view this particular school ought to assume an undenominational character.<lb/>
The religious argument, as I have said, has not been strongly pressed. We have been told that this scheme ought to be rejected on educational grounds. I am in full agreement with one remark which fell from the most rev. Primate. It is not wise, I entirely agree, in the name of county education or in any other name to attempt to stereotype all public secondary schools. Quite the contrary; and I think my noble friend behind me, Lord Sheffield, expressed agreement with the same view. I quite agree that in the case of this particular school, its history being what it is, it would be most desirable that its character&#x2014;a somewhat different character from that of the ordinary secondary school&#x2014;should be maintained. But why should it not be maintained under this scheme? We have heard a statement that it will not be. But why should it not be? I should have thought that the proposals in the scheme for joint representation of several different counties would have had a marked effect in ensuring that result. I can understand the dislike of those who have regarded this as a Church school to some extent to seeing that character altered. That is an argument with which I can sympathise, although I do not agree with it. But I do not see what reason there is to fear that the character of the school would be seriously altered if this scheme became law.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate told us that the ladies who are mistresses there would desire to terminate their engagements if the scheme became law. I cannot think that that would really be a reasonable action on their part unless the character of the school was in any way altered. If the character of the school were lowered one could quite understand that, with the praiseworthy object of maintaining their own <i>status</i> as mistresses of a school of the highest class, they would then desire to leave it, but until some such untoward result as that followed I do not think it would be a reasonable course for them to sever their connection with the school, I do not know whether one of the main objections taken on educational grounds by the right rev. Prelate is the fact that the school Would be subject to the examinations of the Central Board. I believe
<col>732</col>
that those who are responsible for the scheme consider that it would be very desirable that such examinations should be held, but, at the same time, if that fact were considered to stamp the school too strongly as an ordinary secondary school, I can conceive that it might be possible to meet the objectors on that point. But apart from that, and if the main objection at the back of the minds of those who desire to destroy this scheme is that the character of this school as a Church of England school is no longer to be maintained, then I am afraid it will be impossible to meet the objectors on that point.<lb/>
I should like to appeal to your Lordships to think twice before you throw out this scheme, I was going to say a second time, but apparently it can hardly be called a second time because now we are asked to throw it out on entirely different grounds from those which were advanced on a former occasion. And I cannot help thinking that the second set of arguments which have been produced on this occasion, although I can believe that in some ways they are of a character to appeal to your Lordships even more strongly than those which were advanced thirteen years ago&#x2014;I cannot think that on that point either the right rev. Prelate can be said to have proved his case. I trust that your Lordships will not follow him into the Lobby.</membercontribution></p>

Prelate goes to a Division. The noble Earl opposite has taken us back to the somewhat memorable episode of 1897, when the scheme then put forward by the Education Department was thrown out by your Lordships' House. That was, perhaps, a somewhat remarkable illustration of the independence of opinion and judgment for which I think this House does not always receive sufficient credit, but which undoubtedly does prevail within it.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0392"/>
<col>733</col>
It is, perhaps, remarkable that in all the years that have passed since 1897 nothing more has been heard of the necessity for a change in the management of Howell's School, and the question which I venture to think we have to ask ourselves to-day is whether really any case has been made out for imposing a new scheme upon this school.<lb/>
I am certainly not going to drag in the pious founder. There is no occasion to do so. I do not think that in this particular instance we need go further back than the year 1852. In that year an Act of Parliament was passed regulating the affairs of Howell's School, and in that Statute the scope of its operations was placed under the control of the Court of Chancery, and it is a modern scheme authorised by the Court of Chancery which is now in force and under which the school is now managed. Let me enumerate, in the briefest and baldest manner, the facts of the case as I gather them from what has been stated to-night and from what I have found in the Papers which I have been allowed to see. In the first place, although the religious teaching in these schools is given in accordance with the principles of the Church of England it is not contested that the whole administration of the scheme is carrfed on on the most liberal lines. That has been conceded by two or three noble Lords who have addressed us. No suggestion has been made to-night that there is any denominational bias in the teaching given at the school. That is one fact which I do not think will be contested.<lb/>
Then, again, I do not think it will be contested that the school has been most successfully administered and carried on, and that it has done an immense amount of excellent work for education throughout North Wales; and not only that, but that it supplies what is clearly a want in that part of the kingdom. It is, I understand, the only school of this grade in the whole of North Wales. In the next place, the school is adequately staffed, and I am bound to say that it does make an impression upon my mind when I am told that the whole of the teachers have signified their intention of giving up their appointments if this change is brought about in the government of the school. That seems to me conclusive evidence that the change is a real change, and not, as was suggested to us just now, a comparatively unim-
<col>734</col>
portant change dealing only with matters of detail. Again, it is not contested that the record of the school is excellent. A large number of honours have been won by the pupils, and their number has steadily increased from year to year. Then, my Lords&#x2014;a very important fact&#x2014;the school pays its own way; it does not ask for a brass farthing of public money; and I am told&#x2014;I do not know whether correctly&#x2014;that if this scheme was put into effect &#x00A3;2,000 or &#x00A3;3,000 of public money would be necessary to enable the proposed scheme to be carried out. Finally we are told, and it is not contradicted, that the parents desire the school to be conducted as it is now, and we are also told on equally good authority that of the two counties concerned in the school Flintshire is strongly opposed to an alteration of the present scheme.<lb/>
If the facts are as I have stated them&#x2014;and I believe they are&#x2014;what is the case for a change? Surely, as the most rev. Primate said just now, the <i>onus</i> lies with those who ask us to tear up these arrangements by the roots and substitute other arrangements. I have been told that all this has been done without any public inquiry. Is that the case? I am also told that the remonstrance put in by the Drapers' Company, who have been concerned in the government of the school, has been brushed on one side. I am bound to say that I cannot hear of all these things without a suspicion that this is another case of what I cannot help believing to be injudicious meddling on the part of the Welsh Department of the Board of Education. That Department&#x2014;I cannot refrain from saying it&#x2014;is not above suspicion, and those of your Lordships who have taken the pains to read the remarkable judgment lately delivered in the case of the Swansea school which my noble friend (Earl Cawdor) brought before the House last year can have come to no other conclusion but that that Department is one that requires to be watched with the utmost attention. The judgments of the Master of the Rolls and of Lord Justice Farwell came to this, that the Department was open to the imputation either of ignorance of the law or of a perverse interpretation of it. I do not know which horn of the dilemma they prefer. At any rate, after listening to this debate without any particular prejudice in favour of one side or the other, I am bound to say that the right rev. Prelate seemed to me to show con-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0393"/>
<col>735</col>
clusively that no sufficient case had been made for a disturbance of the scheme under which this school is at present administered.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01608"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the House adjourns I should like to ask the noble Earl opposite whether he has arrived at any conclusion as to the date on which the House should re-assemble after the recess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01609"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my own view, and I think the view of His Majesty's Government, was that in view of the fact that our work has not been quite so onerous as that in another place we should re-assemble two days before the House of Commons. That House meets on Thursday, May 26, and I suggest that your Lordships should meet for the consideration</membercontribution></p>
<col>736</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01610">to withhold his assent to the scheme under the Welsh Intermediate Education Acts which relates to the Denbigh Share of Howell's Charity for Girls' Schools in Wales.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01611">Their Lordships divided: Contents, 61; Not-contents, 20.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01612">of Lord Rosebery's Resolutions on Tuesday, May 24. I do not know whether that will suit the convenience of noble Lords opposite, but it would give us a holiday of more than three weeks, and I think perhaps that is as much as we are entitled to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01613"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope this is not the final determination on the part of the noble Earl. I think the understanding was that the House should not meet before May 26. The Resolutions, standing in Lord Rosebery's name are of an extremely important character, and if they were brought forward in another place the discussion on them would take at least two months if there were no obstacles in the way. I understood that it was proposed that the noble Earl should move his Resolutions on Thursday, May 26, and that, if necessary, Friday should also be appropriated to the purpose. That would be a very inconvenient arrange-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0394"/>
<col>737</col>
ment, and I would venture to suggest that it would much better suit the general convenience if the discussion was postponed to the following week, so that a full week beginning on May 30, would be free for the discussion of Lord Rosebery's Resolutions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01614"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The matter is one for your Lordships. I confess it does not seem to me very businesslike to take a longer holiday than they are taking in another place. My suggestion was not, as the noble Lord opposite thinks, that we should begin the discussion on Thursday, May 26, but that it should be begun on Tuesday, May 24, and occupy as long a time as the House might choose to give to it. As noble Lords opposite have a large majority they are, perhaps, more entitled to give an opinion on that point, but I confess that it does seem to me that upwards of four weeks would be a somewhat long holiday to take at this time of the year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01615"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Earl's arguments would, perhaps, be more convincing if there were arrears of business for us to overtake after the recess. All that I am aware of are the Resolutions of Lord Rosebery and the Resolutions which the noble Earl himself will move. They will take a considerable time&#x2014;they ought to take a considerable time&#x2014;and I feel with the
<col>738</col>
noble Earl that we ought not even to have the appearance of delaying the consideration of these important matters. But I confess that the arrangement I was inclined to lean to was that we should reassemble the same day as the House of Commons, and that, in order to make progress with Lord Rosebery's Resolutions, we should sit on the Friday and so give two full days to those Resolutions in that week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01616"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am quite prepared to fall in with that if it is the general sense of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01617"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: May I, with the indulgence of the House, point out that if that arrangement is adopted it will be extremely inconvenient. The discussion will obviously take more than two days, and therefore we should have to adjourn it on the Friday, which is an unusual proceeding, until the following week. Why not begin in the following week and finish it off then?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01618"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: As there seems to be some difference of opinion, perhaps this might be allowed to stand over until to-morrow. In the meantime we may arrive at some agreement.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EDUCATION&#x2014;PARTIAL EXEMPTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01629"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member> rose to call attention to the Reports of the Departmental Committee on Partial Exemption from School Attendance and of the Consultative Committee on Continuation Schools, and to move to resolve, "That in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that legislative effect should be given to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on Partial Exemption, and that a statutory obligation should be imposed on local education authorities to provide, where it is reasonably practicable, continuation schools, and that provision be also made by Statute to aid substantially from Parliamentary funds the cost of such schools."</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01630">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in introducing an educational subject to your Lordships I feel that I am in the pleasant and unusual position of raising a discussion upon a matter which, I think, involves no controversy, and on which I hope both sides of the House will be agreed. In regard to this question of strengthening the education in our day schools and securing a continuation of instruction after the day school career is over, I have the satisfaction of noticing that on April 20 last the House of Commons passed a somewhat similar Resolution after a short debate, without a Division, and with the general approval of both sides. I was also glad to note that the Minister for Education, Mr. Runciman, stated the other day that the Government contemplated legislating on the lines of the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on Partial
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0396"/>
<col>741</col>
Exemption; but, as we know, no educational matter can be touched in the way of legislation during this year. Although this is not a time for introducing legislation it is a time when We may strengthen the hands of the Government with a view to future legislation by making them feel assured of the concurrence of both Houses and both Parties in anything which will make more profitable, more effective, and more lasting the expenditure, which is mounting up so high and which some people think excessively high, on our national education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01631">The Departmental Committee, which reported in July, 1909, recommended unanimously&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. That partial exemption should be abolished.</li>
<li>2. That there should be no total exemption under the age of 13.</li>
<li>3. That no exemption should be allowed by reason of previous school attendance.</li>
<li>4. That exemption at the age of 13 should only be allowed for beneficial or necessary employment.</li>
<li>5. That in case of exemption before the age of 14 the obligation to attend a continuation class be imposed; or</li>
<li>6. That with the approval of the Board of Education the alternative of passing a standard not lower than the VI be permitted, and that these recommendations should override the Factory Acts.</li>
</ol>
It may be confidently affirmed that these proposals are in harmony with the present public opinion of the country. The criticisms of them fall substantially under two heads&#x2014;(1) the allegation that the conditions of rural labour require the early diversion of children from school to field labour; (2) the needs of the textile trades where industrial half-time survives&#x2014;mainly in Laneashire, but also to some extent in the West Riding and in the adjacent districts of North Derbyshire and East Cheshire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01632">To take the agricultural case first, it has been found by experience that what is known as the clause in Robson's Act is quite useless for farming purposes, and has either never been used or has after trial been abandoned. The return of a boy over twelve years of age to winter schooling after summer work on the farm is found objectionable as of little or no profit to the boy and as injurious to the discipline and teaching in the school to which he returns. Moreover, the farmers do not value this intermittent labour. They toll us that if they can get the boys full time at thirteen it is far better for them than to
<col>742</col>
get partial work before thirteen. The two counties which had the largest number of such exemptions&#x2014;namely, Cambridgeshire, 978, and the East Riding of Yorkshire, 386&#x2014;have both of them abolished partial exemption altogether. In Kent there is a certain amount of partial exemption for agricultural employment, but according to Mr. C. J. Phillips, His Majesty's Inspector, there are only about 200 employed in Kent in agriculture, and the demand for children for fruit and hop picking is met, according to the same witness, by arranging the school holidays. On the whole, therefore, it may be said that agricultural employment does not demand a system of partial exemption. No doubt many agricultural employers desire the children to be set free from school at thirteen, and the Departmental Committee make this concession&#x2014;that where the local authority choose they may, for suitable employment, set a child free at thirteen. As the local authorities are the county council elected by the population they will act in accordance with local public opinion, but this school exemption must be for suitable employment, not, for street newspaper selling or other unprofitable or even injurious activity, and it must be coupled either with fair school progress measured by passing at least Standard VI, or it must entail attendance at a continuation school.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01633">As to the textile trades, the employment of children is justified on the grounds of the necessities of the family, the social question, and the need for the earnings, and the expediency of a technical training. I contend that there is absolutely no social reason why children in textile towns should be put to work earlier than in others. In Lancashire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, and in parts of Cheshire and Derbyshire, the working classes are, if anything, in a better condition as to wages and comforts than in other parts of the country generally; and outside the textile towns no difficulty whatever is found in securing the attendance of children up to the age of fourteen. London has as great extremes of wealth and poverty as any town in England, but in London no difficulty has been found in enforcing attendance up to fourteen. Practically all the children in London attend up to fourteen years of age. In Hull ninety-four per cent. of the children in attendance between twelve and thirteen years of age continue in attendance between thirteen and four-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0397"/>
<col>743</col>
teen years of age; in Norwich the proportion is ninety-one per cent. Practically the great mass of the nation does without half-time. There is hardly a half-timer in the whole of Wales. In Glamorganshire and its great urban communities there are only twelve scholars&#x2014;they are in Aberdare&#x2014;obtaining partial exemption, and these are employed as errand boys. In Durham and its large towns there are no cases of partial exemption. Northumberland is practically in the same state. In Lancashire, Liverpool and Manchester are free from half-time. The system is concentrated in the east of the county in a few manufacturing towns. The manufacturers do not desire partial exemption, and although the opinion of the working people is not yet on a level with that of their leaders in respect to this matter, I am informed that if the practice was abolished there would probably be the same acquiescence which followed the raising of the half-time age.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01634">It is unnecessary to dwell on the injurious effect of mill work on these children or on the schools which they attend. The evidence on this subject is overwhelming, and is only disputed by a few interested in upholding the system. The effect on the schools is also bad; either the other scholars in the class are kept back while the half-timers learn their work, or if the class goes forward at the pace of the full-timers the half-timers are unable to follow the lessons. The inability of the half-timer to profit by school teaching is especially noticed when he goes to the mill in the morning and attends school in the afternoon. The evidence before the Departmental Committee showed that employers do not desire this partial exemption; the demand comes from the parents who are unwilling to relinquish this accustomed source of income. But certainly the prosperity of the trade does not demand it. In many of the newer mills no half-timers are employed. Nor does the work of the half-timer lead, as a rule, to adult employment in the same trade, and in many cases the work done by the half-timer is no preparation or training for adult work. In a few cases it may be, but not as a rule. The evidence also showed that the amount of manual skill acquired by the half-timer required a very short period of work. On the whole it may be safely affirmed that while, there are many operatives in the textile towns who would not willingly give
<col>744</col>
up their right to make money out of their children before the age of fourteen, yet if the law were changed it would come quite quietly and easily into operation; the population would very soon be reconciled to the change which the more thoughtful leaders among the working-class Would welcome now. I may say that when the law enabled local authorities to raise the age of exemption from thirteen to fourteen, that change, which was far more extensive, took effect quite easily, and in London no difficulty or friction occurred but the whole population accepted cheerfully the new obligation. The whole system is one the need of which has long passed away. Germany and Switzerland do not find it necessary to have a half-time system. It cannot be justified on the ground that the children's earnings are indispensable to the parents, because, as I have said, the need of the parents in the districts where half-time prevails is often less than that of parents in other parts of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01635">One recommendation of the Departmental Committee would make a material change in many towns&#x2014;namely, the abolition of exemption from school attendance on the ground of previous attendance. In many districts this attendance exemption leads to the bulk of scholars leaving soon after thirteen years of age, I am rather surprised that the great town of Leeds should allow practically the bulk of the children by previous attendance to escape from school at the age of thirteen. In Leeds nineteen per cent. of the children remain between thirteen and fourteen years of age; in Sheffield, twenty-five per cent.; in Salford, twenty-one per cent.; in Oldham, twenty-one per cent.; and in Preston, twenty-four per cent. In these towns more than three-fourths of the children escape from school through exemption on the ground of previous attendance. The experience of the districts which have not enacted the by-law shows that it is quite easy to secure the attendance of nearly all the, scholars up to fourteen. Of course, where there is real poverty and urgent necessity in the family, the local authority use a reasonable discretion in enforcing their by-laws. I will not trouble your Lordships with the evidence, but it was very strong as showing how impossible it is for these children as a rule to profit by the continuation school. Some of them go to a continuation school, and you find a few exceptional instances of wonderful
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0398"/>
<col>745</col>
industry and force which enable a picked few to go ahead in spite of their disadvantages; but the evidence was clear that in these northern towns those children who have been half-timers are for the most part unable to profit by the further instruction which everyone now sees is quite necessary between the ages of fourteen and eighteen to make our rising generation grow up fit citizens.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01636">I now pass from the question of partial exemption and the recommendations of the Departmental Committee to what I think is quite as important a matter&#x2014;the recommendations of the Consultative Committee regarding continuation schools. Everyone connected with schools now sees that it is on the intermediate career of young persons between leaving the day school and growing up into manhood that the future of this nation depends. As we can interest them in good continuation schools so we shall form the characters of the young people of the future. By means of boys' clubs, boy scouts, and girls' clubs everyone is endeavouring to get hold of these young people at the impressionable age. The continuation school is one of the most important instruments for the purpose of helping them and keeping them from going to the bad. The Consultative Committee went further than I am able to invite your Lordships to go to-night. Not that I am not in sympathy with their recommendations, but I am going <i>bona fide</i> to assume the character of a moderate and a rather conservative person in this discussion. I do not want this House to outrun public opinion. I am not saying that in five years we may not be ripe for all the recommendations of the Consultative Committee, but for the moment I merely desire to take one or two of their suggestions for which I think we are absolutely ripe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01637">Many of the recommendations of the Consultative Committee do not require legislation at all. They begin by recommending an improvement in the day school by reducing the size of the classes, by increasing the proportion of qualified teachers, and, in addition to other changes, by at once abolishing all partial exemption under the age of thirteen and in a short time securing the attendance of scholars, with one or two slight allowances, up to the age of fourteen. As to increasing the proportion of qualified teachers and diminishing the size of the classes, that is within the power of every
<col>746</col>
local authority. The Board of Education can by the Code enforce it, and the new Code is doing a great deal in both of these directions. The proposals of the Committee which would require, statutory enactment comprise recommendations that local authorities should be compelled to provide continuation schools and empowered to make by-laws making attendance at such schools compulsory up to the age of seventeen years. I do not think the time is ripe for carrying out the latter proposal. A similar provision was made in the Scottish Educational Act of last year; but none of the great towns of Scotland have exercised the power to make such by-laws, and I am informed that none of them contemplate doing so. It is a curious and interesting fact that the one place which has made a proposal of the kind is the rural parish of Ecclefechan, the birthplace of Carlyle, showing that the genius of resolute, earnest study and tearing out the heart of things survives in that neighbourhood. I think myself that we shall do well to wait in England until the large towns in Scotland have adopted such by-laws and until we have seen how they work. Therefore I exclude from my recommendations to you the proposal for power to compel the attendance of young people up to the age of seventeen. If local authorities were empowered to establish such schools and to make, them attractive and interesting, I believe much might be done without compulsion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01638">We are, I think, ripe for the obligation on the local authority to establish continuation schools where they are needed. I would say, as to this proposition, that it should be enforced with moderation. Before a locality or individuals interested could demand, or the Board of Education impose the duty of providing, a continuation school there should be evidence, of a demand on behalf of, say, not less than fifteen pupils in a rural district, and not less than thirty pupils in an urban district for such a school. Concurrently with this obligation there should be a statutory subsidy where schools are opened providing for the payment out of a Parliamentary grant of one-half of the cost of maintenance of such schools up to an amount per head to be ascertained on the basis of the cost as worked out in fact under similar conditions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01639">A great mistake was made a few years ago when ordinary evening schools, as
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0399"/>
<col>747</col>
distinguished from technical schools, were treated as part of the system of secondary education. There should be two forms of continuation schools, and those which form the necessary supplement of ordinary day schools should be under the management of the authority controlling elementary education. These schools would be so intimately connected with the elementary school by the use of the buildings, services of the teachers, and immediate transference of scholars from the elementary school, that in the smaller urban areas the two managements should be identified. In counties the cost, like that of the elementary schools, should be a county charge. Possibly it might also be well to continue school obligation in the day school up to fifteen for those who are not suitably employed. There is much to be said in the case of girls for making this instruction largely connected with domestic training, and possibly of a half-time character. The wider proposals for enabling local authorities to enact compulsory bylaws for attendance at evening school might stand over until we had seen the effect of the milder provisions I suggest, and until we could see how far the new powers of the Scottish Act are used and how they work. I am content in England to wait upon the experience and progressive action of Scotland. I could only wish that our authorities were more ready to follow Scotland's example where it is shown to have succeeded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01640">I may notice that even now the difficulty of establishing continuation schools in rural districts has not been found insurmountable. The Departmental Committee report that in Bedfordshire, Cornwall, Kesteven, Cardiganshire&#x2014;all rural counties&#x2014;there is at least one continuation school to every three public elementary schools, and the number of scholars in the evening schools is comparable with many of the urban enrolments. In Cambridgeshire, according to Mr. Keen, the secretary of the Education Committee, out of 130 parishes 100 had evening schools though the official figures do not confirm this statement. But if we are to make real progress in securing further study on the part of our industrial population after they leave the day school, I am sure that the following conditions are essential&#x2014;(1) greater State aid; (2) the schools should be free, or at least the fee should be returned to scholars who make a reasonable number of
<col>748</col>
attendances; (3) great liberty should be left to the local authority and also to the local committees as to the subjects taught; there should be no limitation of the freedom of the scholars to take one or more subjects, and we should rather consult the desires of the scholars than our own general notions as to enforcing any one subject rather than another.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01641">Moreover, the recreative element should be introduced&#x2014;singing, gymnastics, dancing, magic lantern lessons, anything to attract somewhat sluggish and weary young people to the school. Where a school can be started in connection with a club so much the better. The young people's club might be a feature of every parish, town and county, and the managers of the club would be valuable co-operators in pushing and popularising the evening school. I am sure that at the present day one of the most valuable improvements we can make in our national education is the preserving of what has been learnt and the utilising of the school knowledge by means of cheerful instruction carried through the critical years from fourteen to seventeen. To do this we want the community, through its official agency of the education committee, to furnish the teaching and the equipment, but we want every local voluntary force that exists for the welfare of the population to be called in as helpers, to enlist the sympathy of those who are to be taught and of employers and all others who control or influence these young people. It is, then, to the free life of the locality, both the wider life of the county and the town as a whole and the more restricted activities of the parish, that I look for the real impulse. The State should find a large part of the means, but should not try from Whitehall to be over wise or too directive in controlling the wisdom and action of those who are administering the work throughout the country.</p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01643"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we shall agree that the noble Lord has added to his long roll of services to education by the speech which he has just delivered. I do not think we have any happier experience than when the noble Lord is able for a time to lay aside the controversial side of his position on these matters and to come before us with his instructive thoughts and in the character of one, I suppose, of the greatest living authorities on the whole matter of public education, and perhaps the greatest authority in this House. I may take the opportunity of saying that the most rev. Primate desired me to express this evening his regret that an ecclesiastical engagement of a peremptory character, which will be seen in the newspapers to-morrow morning, absolutely forbade him from being here. The most rev. Primate felt it his duty to break a lance last night with the noble Lord. All the more, therefore, would he have desired to be here tonight to give the noble Lord the cordial support which he certainly would have given. I think, further, we shall agree that the noble Lord has fully justified his claim to appear before us this evening as a moderate reformer. He has shown us that he sees that beyond the lines which he indicates for present action there is, perhaps now and certainly in a little while, more to do, and I think we shall admit that he has restrained himself within quite a limited province.<lb/>
There are two parts in the noble Lord's Motion. First of all, he grounds himself upon the Report of the Departmental Committee on Partial Exemption. When We look at those excellent recommendations there is very much that we are glad to see, and which would be a gain. The noble Lord dealt in a very skilful manner with the whole question of half-time, and we are glad to feel that this rather dismal controversy is apparently drawing to its close. But when we come to the matter of the total exemption which may still be granted at the age of thirteen, I cannot help expressing my regret that the Committee have not felt themselves strong enough, for I assume that they desired it, to make attendance at a continuation school the only ground for total exemption. They do make attendance at a continuation school the ordinary condition of total exemption, but the authority may adopt as an alternative condition the passing of a standard
<col>750</col>
not lower than the sixth. I do not know what was in their minds when they made that qualification, but whether or no they are right in making it, I think we shall agree that it is regrettable if such a qualification has to be made, because what is the effect of it? The effect is that if a boy by thirteen years of age has reached Standard VI, then we are, certainly not without regret but without any practical protest, to allow him to drop out of education altogether. As the noble Lord has said, it is one of the greatest evils at the present time in this matter of education, that those upon whom we have spent so much money, upon whom the teachers have spent so much in pains, upon whom the parents have in a way spent so much in wages not earned, go out after the age of thirteen and constantly lose, as there is abundant evidence to show, the greater part of what they have learnt. Of course, if they have reached a higher standard there is less likelihood of their losing it, but the danger is real.<lb/>
The noble Lord, in the latter part of his Motion, passes away from that particular Report, and he would compel local authorities everywhere to provide continuation schools. I should think that would be excellent. But the most anxious and important question about these schools will be, what scholars will go into them. I cannot but feel&#x2014;perhaps I am an extreme reformer compared with the noble Lord!&#x2014;that the day cannot be far distant when we shall have as a nation to apply pressure upon young people in the years that follow the age of thirteen and fourteen to be educated; or, as I would prefer to put it, we shall as a nation have to surround those young people with safeguards against the pressure which prevents their continuing their education. Are there not some rather anxious features about this? I trust that the noble Earl will correct me if I am wrong on this or on any other point, but I believe that evening schools at present tend to decline rather than to go up. Certainly they have not made the large progress which we should have hoped. The suggestions referred to by the noble Lord with regard to making evening schools more attractive in their character are probably mere expedients which people have been devising in order to try and overcome that difficulty. But it is not a question only of quantity. It seems almost a more important matter
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0401"/>
<col>751</col>
still that only a small percentage of those who attend the evening schools are children of unskilled labourers; that is to say, the class which demands from us most of our sympathy, which causes us most of our anxiety, which economically and nationally in all ways is our crux&#x2014;that class is the one which is getting comparatively very little benefit from continuation schools. Therefore this is the class whose present defective educational condition is going to be prolonged. Those are the children that we most particularly want to get into continuation schools. We can imagine reasonable parents, themselves unskilled and having encountered all the difficulties which beset unskilled labour, saying that they want their sons to get on better than they have done themselves. We can imagine them saying, "I cannot get my boy to go to the continuation school. I wish to goodness the powers that be would help me by making it a rule that he should do so." I believe that things are moving in that direction. I saw an account of an interesting experiment not long ago in America&#x2014;I think it was in the town of Chicago&#x2014;where employers had made a move voluntarily in the direction of allowing their younger <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> to have half their time off in order that they should enjoy the advantage of continuation schools. The noble Lord (Lord Sheffield) informs me that some employers are doing that in England too. That follows the line of most promise, because everyone knows that the great difficulty about anything like compulsory attendance at continuation schools is that when a lad has had the vital force taken out of him by a hard day's labour he has not much to give in the continuation school, and you may injure his health by compelling him to attend. But in such cases as I have referred to, where employers consent to allow their junior <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> to have half their time off, they make in that way two boys count for one. We are abolishing&#x2014;at least we hope we shall abolish&#x2014;half-time exemption from school under the age of thirteen. I myself feel very much that we shall have to go on to a new kind of half-time exemption&#x2014;not half-time exemption from school for the sake of work, but half-time exemption later from work for the sake of school, in order that young people may continue the education which they have received and get a training which will carry them forward into the ranks of skilled labour.<lb/>
<col>752</col>
The last word I desire to say is upon the importance of what may contribute to that result. Directly we deal with an education question here, however skilled the speaker may be, we are landed at once in what appear to be a number of technicalities. No one feels more than the noble Lord, as his concluding sentences show, that what on one side sounds technical is on the other side the most vital question before the nation. I think I can speak for a good many people of different sorts, all of them actively and intelligently employed upon the work of dealing with the young people of this country, when I say this has got to be more and more urgently felt as the thing with which we must deal. Both Reports of the Poor Law Commission have set this on high as the prominent object of public attention. It is so everywhere. The response to that is coming, I think, from all sides. Incidentally I cannot help feeling a little proud and pleased that the religious bodies of this country have, to their honour, one and all contributed to the care of those who are in the critical years between fourteen and eighteen; and now, as so often happens, it is suggested that all this voluntary work may fall in and be combined in different ways with what can be done under public authorities. Let no one imagine that we are dealing here with technical points. We are dealing with the draining away of the vital force of the nation. I do not mean merely the physical force in their limbs; I mean the power which is in growing lads by which they may be made efficient citizens, and which is the highest asset the community possesses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01644"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to support the contention of the noble Lord which has been so strongly supported by my brother Bishop. Having been engaged in the education of the young for the greater part of my life, I have of necessity been led to feel that legislation of this kind is long overdue. It seems to most of those who are actively doing work in the education of the young that it is both most wasteful and even absurd that we should continue to allow the great mass of our children to leave the elementary schools at the early age of thirteen and drift we know not whither, to grow up through all the most critical years of early life without any certain discipline or instruction or those higher
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0402"/>
<col>753</col>
influences which tend to make the good man and the true citizen. I have been led to feel over and over again that it is really absurd that we should allow the great bulk of our children thus to drift away from all the higher influences of life at the very time when your Lordships are sending your sons to Eton or some other public school for the best part of their education.<lb/>
In supporting the contention of the noble Lord, my only regret is that he did not go a step further with the Consultative Committee. He urges that it should be made obligatory for local authorities to establish, wherever they seem to be required, continuation classes or schools. It seems to me to be only reasonable that, if we impose that duty on the local authorities, we should at the same time give them the power to see that the expenses incurred and the organisation set on foot should be really made use of by those for whom they are intended. They should be enabled to make by-laws obliging the children of their district to attend these classes or schools during a certain period. I myself have felt this so long that five or six years ago I ventured to introduce into your Lordships' House a Continuation School Bill. At that time the noble Marquess opposite was Lord President, and he did not see his way to give any support to that Bill. But I venture to think that during the last few years public opinion has advanced very much in this respect, and we are all thankful to see what a great impetus has been given to the progress of public opinion in this and other matters by the admirable Report of the Poor Law Commission. I sincerely hope that the measures for which my noble friend has pleaded so well to-night may be very shortly taken in hand. I hope that at the same time it may be found that public opinion is sufficiently advanced to go even one step further and to make attendance at continuation schools or some kind of training for life obligatory on our growing lads up to the age of seventeen or eighteen, so as to save them at this critical period from all the risks of an undisciplined youth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01645"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Lord President, to whom it would naturally have fallen to take part
<col>754</col>
in this debate, is not able to be in his place. In these circumstances I hope my noble friend will excuse me if it is with brevity that I deal with the important and interesting question raised by him. I heartily concur in what has fallen from other speakers, that we are always glad when my noble friend, speaking as he does with unique authority, gives us the advantage of his knowledge of this subject in such a debate as this.<lb/>
Of the two parts into which my noble friend's Motion is divided I will first say a a few words on what is called partial exemption, or more familiarly half-time. I have no doubt that my noble friend, like many other educational enthusiasts, would have desired, if he had thought he was not going too far ahead of public opinion, to stop exemption altogether up to the age of fourteen; but he felt, and his colleagues on the Committee undoubtedly felt also, that it was useless to attempt more than public opinion would support. They therefore made the suggestion to which the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Southwark alluded. As regards half-time exemption, I think my noble friend is justified in saying that public opinion has advanced in the direction of abolishing half-time altogether. There can be no doubt that whenever its abolition takes place some employers would consider that they had a grievance. There would be, perhaps, even more parents of children who might be half-timers who will resent the loss of the small sums earned by those children. But, speaking generally, I think my noble friend is justified in his contention.<lb/>
I feel that the one argument which used to be advanced with some force in favour of the half-time system has been swept away by the Report of the Committee. If it could be maintained that the half-time system was a kind of substitute for apprenticeship, and that those children who were subjected to it proceeded by an easy stage to undertake their life's work in the trade in which they had been half-timers, even at some sacrifice of education it might be maintained, the organisation of labour being so difficult as it is, that there is something to be said for half-time. But my noble friend has shown, I think very clearly, that this is not the case. It is not the fact that in the textile trades the half-time children
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0403"/>
<col>755</col>
proceed by a sort of labour ladder to become regular workers in the trade, and in those circumstances I think we must feel that the case for the half-time system has practically altogether vanished.<lb/>
Then my noble friend dealt with the rural side of the question, and I think the House must have listened with great interest to what fell from him on the subject. At the time that what was known as Robson's Act was passed&#x2014;the effect of which, as your Lordships know, was practically to allow a child to do most of his schooling in the winter and be therefore able to undertake agricultural labour in the summer months&#x2014;high hopes were entertained that that might operate in some degree as a solution of the problem. But my noble friend has pointed out that this Act has been very little used, and where it has been used it has not apparently been found to serve its purpose. That, I think, is a disappointing fact in itself, because this rural problem is something more than an educational problem. It is not merely a problem of teaching the children in the schools at one time and allowing them to work at another. It is a problem of giving them the kind of education in the rural schools which should induce them to remain on the land, and I think it was hoped that this form of the half-time system might assist in the object which we all desire to promote. If it cannot be assisted in that way, we must hope that it may be assisted in other ways&#x2014;namely, by changes from time to time as may be found necessary in the curriculum of rural schools, in perhaps a still larger attention to various forms of technical training which may be later on applied to an agricultural life, and by expedients of that kind. But I am bound to say that, so far as the half-time system or any application of it to rural life is concerned, I think that my noble friend has again shown that it is of no very great value.<lb/>
I pass to the second part of my noble friend's Motion&#x2014;to the question of continuation schools, which, as he has reminded us, are by no means in all cases properly to be described as secondary schools as that term is generally understood. My noble friend stated, with some pride, that on this subject he was playing the part of the moderate man. That has, indeed, proved to be the case, because those who have spoken from the right rev.
<col>756</col>
Bench have shown themselves in this matter more advanced than he is. What my noble friend asks is that the provision of some form of continuation school should be made compulsory on the local education authority where a demand exists, the demand to be proved by the existence of a certain number of scholars wishing to attend the school. I confess I do not feel quite sure that the passing of a Statute of that kind would have in itself a very far-reaching effect. My noble friend will correct me if I am wrong, but I am under the impression that the greater part of the local education authorities do now make provision of a kind for continuation schools. It really, therefore, comes to this, that it is not so much a question of merely saying that the local education authority must open, if required, a continuation school or class; it is not so much a question of merely ordaining that the local education authority should open a school or class, as the sort of obligations or regulations in reference to that school which you are to impose on the local authority.<lb/>
I confess myself I should be very sorry&#x2014;and this also, I believe, is the view of my right hon. friend&#x2014;altogether to close the door to the idea of instituting in England and Wales the same kind of local option which was applied in the Scottish Act of 1908. The noble Lord told us that permissory power to enforce the attendance of scholars at continuation schools has not been used in Scotland so far; but the time has been very short, and I am not quite sure that there are not special circumstances which have caused some delay in the matter in the minds of some of the principal Scottish local authorities. Therefore I do not believe myself that we should be proceeding ahead at any rate of better public opinion if we were to institute some similar form of local option in this country. I am sure that in saying that my noble friend will not quarrel with me in any way. It is merely that he fears that the power may not be used. I quite agree that, speaking as a general rule, it is undesirable to confer upon local authorities or upon any administrative body optional powers of a nature which they are not inclined to use. It has been pointed out, so far as compulsory attendance is concerned, that there are several large and important firms who practically make it a condition that youths in their employment should attend continuation schools, and something of
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0404"/>
<col>757</col>
the same kind is being done by the Post Office. As matters now stand, I take it that it is only possible for very large and well-known firms, into whose service young men are particularly anxious to enter, to make an obligation of that kind. So far as the smaller employers are concerned it would, no doubt, be difficult for them on grounds of expense, and each man would feel that he was doing something that he was not obliged to do&#x2014;sacrificing something, perhaps, which his neighbour was not prepared to sacrifice.<lb/>
My Lords, on the general question I agree most heartily with what fell from the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Southwark as to the supreme importance of what happens to the youth of England after they leave the elementary schools. The right rev. Prelate alluded to both of the Reports of the Poor Law Commission. Certainly those who were responsible for those Reports have in no way under-estimated the gravity of this question, I do not know any feature in our national life at this moment which ought to make us feel more thoroughly uncomfortable than the fact of this perpetual waste of power and of money which is going on by the blind alley, as it is called, into which so many of these young people enter after they leave the elementary school. In one point the Board of Education are anxious to assist, and it is a direction in which I think something practical may be done. It is, I admit, only a palliative, but still it is of some service. That is to say, to bring the school authorities into communication with those who desire to employ young people when they leave school&#x2014;to institute a sort of information agency, or, if you like to call it so, a juvenile labour exchange, in each case, through which boys when they leave school may be tempted to undertake some employment which would be of a permanent character, and not slide so easily as they do into various forms of temporary employment which lead to nothing, and which, when they come to an end, leave the youth or young man, as he then is, unskilled in any useful trade, and almost certain before long to join the ranks of the unemployed. If noble Lords refer to the Scottish Act of two years ago they will see that a somewhat similar provision exists there of establishing these information agencies, and I understand that the Board of Education are about to issue an important
<col>758</col>
circular on the subject for the benefit of this country.<lb/>
It is, of course, impossible for a Minister, when he speaks on a subject like this, not to draw attention to the fact that most of these improvements must mean a great deal of money. My noble friend behind me is well aware of that. He has indicated that it would be proper for Parliament when dealing with this question to tell the local authorities that it is prepared to pay half the cost which may be involved. I am afraid it is not very often the custom of the Treasury to undertake to pay half the cost of anything without knowing pretty clearly what that cost is likely to be, and I am afraid that, whatever contribution may be made from public funds, it is not likely to take the form of offering to pay half of an expenditure the gross amount of which is to be fixed by somebody else. But, short of that, I think it is quite evident that the cost of this education, semi-secondary if you like to call it so or in some cases secondary, will have partly to be met by contributions from the funds of the nation. It is too heavy a burden for the local authorities to bear alone. Upon that we should all be agreed. If you are going to institute a system of compulsory continuation schools for 1,500,000 or 2,000,000 of young people, it must mean a vast expenditure. I do not say that the expenditure would be wasted. Indeed, I conceive it might be necessary. If you can show that unless you undertake at any rate a considerable expenditure the enormous amount which you are expending upon elementary education is in some degree wasted, that, of course, is a strong argument for making your elementary education expenditure fruitful by going a little further. But we know that all those arguments, excellent though they are, do not always appeal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He has to think of balancing his accounts, and although every Chancellor of the Exchequer, to whatever Party he belongs, would sympathise with the objects of such expenditure as this, he is not able, in the particular position which he fills, to look at ultimate results to such an extent as many of us desire to do. But, subject to that, I can assure my noble friend that his objects have the sympathy of His Majesty's Government, and I hope that when it is found possible to put forward a legislative project on the subject in the main at any

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01646"><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to express my great pleasure at having heard such a very sympathetic reply from the noble Earl the Leader of the House to the Resolution moved by the noble Lord. I am certain that many of your Lordships have for years felt, as I have, that one of the greatest dangers to our country is the fact that we allow our children to leave school at the age of thirteen, and that all the money expended upon them up to that age is in many cases lost to the country. Many of them after that age really forget for a time how to read and write, and if we are going to make our education of real use to the country and to place ourselves on a par with other nations, it is absolutely necessary that we should turn our attention to the subject brought before us by the noble Lord, and strain every effort to have these continuation schools made as far compulsory as possible. I fully admit that it is impossible for us to go in advance of public opinion; but I have some knowledge of what those are thinking who are interested in educational matters, and I am convinced that the public opinion of the present day, so far as those classes are concerned, is entirely in favour of the noble Lord. I have only lately returned from a long voyage. I visited many countries, and it is always a grief to me to feel when I come home that our young people are the only people in the world amongst civilised nations who have not the opportunity of continuing their education up to the age of sixteen, seventeen, and even eighteen. It is one of the great dangers which I fear to the Empire, that our young people are not being trained in the same efficient manner as the younger generations of other countries. I thank the noble Earl for his sympathetic reply, and also the noble Lord for having brought such an important subject to the notice of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE HOUSE AND GOVERNMENT BILLS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01653"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether they will grant a Return stating&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. The number of Bills brought before the House of Lords, whether introduced in that House or the House of Commons, from 1906 to the present time.</li>
<li>2. The number of such Bills passed by the House of Lords.</li>
<li>3. The number and titles of such Bills, which having been before the House of Lords, were dropped by His Majesty's Government.</li>
<li>4. The number and title of such Bills rejected by the House of Lords.</li>
</ol>
I have ventured to ask for a Return which seems to me to be of very great importance, and as there exists some little misunderstanding as to what precisely I ask for, perhaps I may be allowed a short time in which to explain.<lb/>
In the first place, I would like to point out that what I refer to are public Bills. One of the principal reasons given for the destruction of what is known as the Lords' Veto is the unfair treatment that Liberal measures are supposed to receive at our hands. This is a very grave charge, and in view of what is before us I think it is desirable than an official statement should be given showing what we have actually done. We have had
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0406"/>
<col>761</col>
experience of the difference between general statements and particular statements. The former, of course, are not always very easy to meet, but the experience we have had of the particular statements that have been made against individuals is that almost in every case there are important omissions, and often gross misrepresentation, which entirely alter the character of the charge that is made, and refutation is a simple and easy matter. Perhaps I might be allowed to state my own experience.<lb/>
Your Lordships will remember that there was a campaign of Peers during the last General Election in which many of your Lordships took a not inglorious part. I was one of those who took part in that campaign, and I am bound to own that the exaggerations which I met with made my position one of considerable difficulty. Take the many decorative posters that offended the artistic eye during the whole of that campaign. In localities where a peer was known it did not very much matter, because the people knew what to expect and were not disappointed; but in localities where Peers were not known there was a considerable amount of disappointment when the audiences realised the difference between a Peer in the flesh and a Peer on the posters, and I think many of them were inclined to agree with the description of this House which was given by Mr. Redmond. Speaking soon after the Prime Minister spoke at the Albert Hall, he referred to the fact that for the first time for over a century the Nationalists had the best opportunity they had had of trampling on and tearing up the Act of Union, and the only obstacle in the way were three or four hundred common-place, obscure, unrepresentative old gentlemen. The audiences on those occasions would always listen to what one had to say, and while they could judge for themselves of the exaggerations in the posters they felt that there might possibly be an equal amount of exaggeration in the picture of the Peer as painted by the speakers on the platform. I should like to take this opportunity of recording my own experience with regard to those who differed from my political opinions in the audiences I addressed. I had occasion to address audiences sometimes consisting of a majority of those opposed to me in politics, and in no single instance did I fail to meet with courtesy and fair play.<lb/>
<col>762</col>
What is it we are charged with? In the first place, we are told that our motives are always mean, selfish, and sordid. The attribution of motives is not a very powerful argument, because, obviously, no one knows our motives but ourselves, and if others accuse us of sordid and selfish motives we can imagine where they get their ideas from. Then we are supposed always to be opposed to progress. That is absolutely untrue, and for proof that it is untrue you have only to compare the Statute Book of to-day with the Statute Book as it was on the accession of the late Queen Victoria. I will undertake to say that in no country during a period of the same time has there been so much social progress, so much improvement in the conditions and in the welfare of the people, as has taken place in that time in this country. When I was a Member of the House of Commons it was an interesting controversy between the two parties as to which Party was responsible for these measures of improvement; and while I do not propose to argue that point now I think I can safely say that the Unionist Party have no need to be ashamed of its share. But no matter which Party has the credit for the inception of those measures, your Lordships have the credit of having passed all of them.<lb/>
Then we are told that we set ourselves against the will of the people. That is not true either. We always endeavour to carry out the wishes of the people, but we always like to make certain what really is the will of the people. It is a remarkable fact that when in 1906 a large majority of the electors supported the Liberal Party, they were then supposed to show great intelligence and political integrity; but when, after four years experience of a Liberal Government, they changed their opinions and voted the other way in large numbers, then we are told that it is beer in the boroughs and feudalism in the counties. The reason of the change, my Lords, is neither beer, feudalism, plural voting, nor undue influence. We say that the reason for the change is to be found in the disappointment felt by the electors at the failure of the Government to carry out the lavish promises made at the last election and distrust of the methods employed.<lb/>
Again we are told that we are the lethal chamber of Liberal legislation, and if
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0407"/>
<col>763</col>
I am granted the Return for which I ask, we shall have all these matters definitely shown to the public. If this House is the lethal chamber of Liberal legislation, at any rate the death rate is not a very heavy one. There was a letter written by Lord Avebury the other day in which he quoted from an article in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, from the pen of a Liberal, in which it was stated that 236 measures had passed the House of Commons and of these 232 had also been passed by the House of Lords. Therefore in view of the difference between these two estimates it is of very great importance that we should have a definite and official statement as to what actually has taken place. We cannot forget that there are great changes promised in the future the result of which no one can foretell. If those changes are to come, I maintain that they should not be produced by vague general charges incapable of substantiation, but that, in fairness to your Lordships and in the general interests of the country, the facts should be fairly placed before the electors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01654"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Earl will not press for this Return. As the guardians of the paper and ink of this House, we are bound, I think, to consider what the real value of such a Return as this would be. The noble Earl devoted a considerable part of his speech to matters which he would be the first to admit do not directly concern this House&#x2014;namely, what he describes as the exaggerations and misrepresentations which accompany electioneering campaigns&#x2014;although I am glad to know that he himself always met with the cordial reception which I am confident, knowing something of the neighbourhood in which the noble Earl lives, would be certain to meet him everywhere. But when you come to this particular Return, would it have any real meaning or value? As I understand, the noble Earl's one argument in favour of granting the Return is that if it is possible to show that you have passed two or three hundred Bills and have only rejected four or five, then the case as to undue harshness in regard to Liberal legislation is disposed of. Is that so? I will put a parallel to the noble Earl. His return for some reason only goes back to 1906. I think the starting point ought to have been 1895. He would find that during the years 1895 to 1906 no Bill coming from the House of
<col>764</col>
Commons was rejected in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01655"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: That is just the reason I did not ask for the Return from that year. I knew there were none.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01656"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Supposing during that whole time only three Bills had been thrown out by this House, and those three Bills had been the Education Bill of 1902, the Irish Land Bill of 1903, and the Licensing Bill of 1904. It is quite true that an enormous preponderance of Bills brought up from the House of Commons would have been passed by your Lordships' House, but the result would have been that no important measure of the then Government would have been allowed to pass into law. My argument, therefore, is that the purely numerical test is an absolutely misleading one. If it is of any value to the noble Earl to say at one of his public meetings that the House of Lords passed 300 Bills and only threw out four, he can say it. I do not think it is a very difficult argument to dispose of, or that it really meets the gravamen of the charge brought against your Lordships' House. Therefore I do not think that such a Return would have any real value, and in view of the fact that it would be actually misleading I must ask the noble Earl to be good enough not to press for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01657"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was rather surprised when I heard the noble Earl who leads the House express his unwillingness to grant the Return asked for by my noble friend. If it had been a difficult and expensive Return to compile I could have understood his opposing the request, but I take it that the preparation of these figures would be an extremely simple matter. The noble Earl complains that my noble friend only desires to carry the Return back to the year 1906, but I think there is an excellent reason for which my noble friend adopted that limit of time. It is constantly stated by the friends and supporters of the Government that the last four years during which they have been in office have been years of humiliation to them&#x2014;that is the usual expression&#x2014;years during which their position has become intolerable owing to the practice of this House in throwing out Government measures. That is a charge which my noble friend wishes to disprove, and he says, I think naturally enough,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0408"/>
<col>765</col>
that it is impossible to disprove it unless you have authentic and official figures to which you can appeal. I admit, as the noble Earl has said, that a purely numerical test is not by itself conclusive. Supposing this Return were to be produced, everyone who studied it would, of course, have to distinguish between small, trivial, and unimportant measures and measures of an opposite character. The noble Earl would find, however, that this House has not only accepted the passing, but done a great deal to facilitate the passing, of a considerable number of measures of great importance promoted by His Majesty's Government, measures which at some points might have been expected to tread upon the toes of the particular class to which your Lordships are supposed to belong. I do not know whether, after the objection of the noble Earl, my noble friend will press for this Return. But I must say that if the Return is refused we shall draw our own conclusions, and when my noble friend reappears on the public platform I fancy he will be much tempted to comment on the manner in which this very useful information is being withheld from the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01658"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after what has fallen from the noble Earl and the noble Marquess it is not my intention to press for this Return, but I should like to endorse what has fallen from my noble friend Lord Lansdowne. I quite realise that a numerical test is of no value at all, but as one of my requests was that the Return should give the names and titles of the Bills so rejected, obviously everyone would be able to form his own conclusion as to the importance of a particular measure. I am sorry we are not to have this Return, but after what has been said I will not press for it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ANGLO-RUSSIAN CONVENTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01659"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government how far the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1899 affects the proposal to build a railway from Chinchow to Aigun. The Convention lays down that this country engages not to seek for any railway concession north of the Great Wall of China in return for a similar undertaking by Russia in the Yangtsze Valley. In November last I drew attention in this House to the fact that Russian financiers had intimated their intention of
<col>766</col>
participating in railway enterprise in the Yangtsze Valley, and I asked whether, in those circumstances, British subjects were still debarred from enterprise north of the Great Wall. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, in a reply couched in language all too kind to me, stated that the proposed participation by Russians did not appear to contravene the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention, and he went on to add that" His Majesty's Government did not anticipate that British participation in railway enterprises north of the Great Wall of China on similar terms to those on which the Russians were engaged in the Yangtsze Valley would occasion any protest on the part of the Russian Government."<lb/>
Since that time there appears to have been some change in the policy of His Majesty's Government, for on March 23 the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, replying to a Question in another place, said&#x2014;
<quote>"In the matter of the Chinchow-Aigun Railway, in which His Majesty's Government have been pressed to take an active part, they are unable to do so as they are bound to pay some regard to the provisions of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1899, which has never formally teen abrogated."</quote>
I am advised that the terms under which it is proposed to construct this railway north of the Great Wall are considerably more favourable to China than are the terms under which Russian financiers propose to construct the railway in the Yangtsze Valley. If His Majesty's Government are of opinion that the Russian loan in the Yangtsze Valley does not contravene the terms of the Agreement, then the proposal to construct this railway north of the Great Wall would not appear to do so either. What is sauce for Russia in the Yangtsze Valley should be sauce for Great Britain north of the Great Wall. There appears to be some feeling that this country is being made the catspaw of Japan in regard to Manchuria and Mongolia. That is not a question into which I propose to enter at the present moment. But I trust that His Majesty's Government will make it clear that, so far from backing up those who oppose the construction of this railway, they will take at any rate as active a part in promoting the enterprise of British subjects north of the Great Wall as the Russian Government have done in the matter of the enterprise of Russian financiers in regard to the railway in the Yangtsze
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0409"/>
<col>767</col>
Valley, and that it is not to be the open-door policy in the Yangtsze Valley and the spheres of influence policy north of the Great Wall, but the same policy in both regions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01660"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has stated quite correctly the purpose of the Agreement of 1899. The proposed Chinchow-Aigun Railway would begin north of the Great Wall, and, therefore, at first sight might seem to fall within the scope of the Agreement; but it is, of course, also true that China proposes to construct the line, and therefore, in a strict sense, it might be argued that this particular line does not fall within the terms of the Agreement. If it does not fall within the letter of the Agreement His Majesty's Government think that it certainly does fall within its spirit, because the Russian Government have intimated to us that on strategical and economic grounds generally they consider themselves interested in the scheme for the line. When the noble Earl compares the two spheres it must be remembered that this line runs right up to the Russian frontier, and I believe actually crosses the Russian railway. The Government have been pressed to take an active part in the matter because British contractors are interested in it; and it is only this regard to the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Agreement which in our opinion forbids us to do so. But it would be altogether a misapprehension to say that in doing this we are running counter to the British or American interests involved. We are obliged to take the line that in view of the terms of the Agreement it is not proper for us to exercise diplomatic interference in the particular region in which it is proposed that this railway should be made.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE CHINESE MARITIME CUSTOMS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01661"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government what is the nature of the changes which the Chinese Government have made or propose to make in connection with the Imperial Maritime Customs Service by the establishment of a Board of Control; what are the powers and composition of the Board and whether, in view of the recent changes in the <i>personnel</i> of the Board, His Majesty's Government will insist upon a full recognition of the Inspector-General's undivided control over the <i>personnel</i> and finances
<col>768</col>
of the Chinese Imperial Customs in accordance with the Loan Agreements of 1896 and 1898.<lb/>
This is a question of considerable importance touching very vast interests. It really concerns the security of capital of the amount of over &#x00A3;40,000,000, the greater part of which is invested by people in this country, but a great deal of which is also invested by persons living on the Continent and in America. Perhaps it would be to the convenience of the House if I should state, very briefly, the views which I believe are generally held, and thus give an opportunity to the noble Earl of contradicting such as are erroneous or based upon misconception. In 1896 and 1898 the Chinese Government desired to raise this loan of something over &#x00A3;40,000,000, and the sole security was to be the Imperial Maritime Customs Service. In order that this service should be administered to the satisfaction of Great Britain and foreign countries, it was agreed that the whole service should be under the absolute control of an Inspector-General who should be an Englishman. The clause in the Agreement reads as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Chinese Imperial Government undertake that the administration of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs shall remain as at present constituted during the currency of the loan."</quote>
That is to say, up to the year 1943. Sir Robert Hart, the then Inspector-General, had been already, I think, about thirty years in the service of the Chinese Empire.<lb/>
That remained the position of affairs, perfectly satisfactory to this country and other countries on the Continent, until May 9, 1906, when an Imperial Edict appeared appointing two distinguished Chinese officials to be Administrators-General of the Customs, with control over all Chinese and foreigners in the Customs Service. Naturally that move on the part of the Chinese Government created a considerable feeling of alarm on the part of those interested in this matter, and, not unnaturally, a perfect avalanche of questions descended on the head of the Secretary of State in another place. There was also a debate in this House, in which the then Under-Secretary was enabled to inform your Lordships that His Majesty's Government were pressing for an assurance that the authority of the Inspector-General should be in no way interfered with. Shortly after that an assurance was given
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0410"/>
<col>769</col>
stating that the Imperial Edict did not make any change in the administration of the Customs Service. That assurance, however, was never really circulated, although Sir Robert Hart was authorised to inform the Customs Service some months afterwards&#x2014;in September, 1906&#x2014;on the authority of the Administrators-General, that the work was to proceed as before and the staff remain in the same relation to the Inspector-General as before the issue of the Edict.<lb/>
An assurance has very little weight in China as compared with an Imperial Edict; and, as <i>The Times</i> correspondent in Peking has on several occasions pointed out, the Administrators-General, or the Board of Control as they came to be known, were issuing orders in every one of which they repeated the words "in accordance with the Imperial Edict"; and it soon became apparent that the Board of Control were beginning to take considerable hold over the Customs Service. That at first did not appear to be of any great moment, for Sir Robert Hart naturally had such immense influence and was so respected on all hands in China that one could be perfectly certain that his authority would remain unimpaired. But it was found that the Customs Service, by being severed from its connection with the Wai-wu-pu, of which till then it was a department, lost a certain amount of authority and standing in its intercourse with Chinese officials. In April, 1908, Sir Robert Hart left Peking on leave of absence, and Sir Robert Bredon was put temporarily in charge of the Customs Service. With Sir Robert Hart's retirement from Peking the Board of Control naturally took the opportunity to strengthen their hold over the Customs, and that, I think, is more or less continuing up to the present time. Recently Sir Robert Bredon retired from the appointment of acting Inspector-General, and Mr. Aglen was appointed in his place, but on retiring Sir Robert Bredon was forthwith added to the Board of Control. I venture to think that by that appointment the whole character of the Board of Control was completely changed.<lb/>
Recently Sir Robert Bredon retired from his position on the Board of Control, and His Majesty's Government have now a favourable opportunity&#x2014;one, perhaps, that will never recur&#x2014;in view of the appointment of a new Inspector-General and of the Board of Control returning
<col>770</col>
to its original composition, of pressing the Chinese Government to make the Inspector-Generalship absolute over the <i>personnel</i> and finances of the Customs Service&#x2014;as absolute as it was before the issue of the Imperial Edict of 1906. By so doing I believe His Majesty's Government would not only ensure the safety of British and foreign capital, but would also maintain the financial stability of China herself. I venture to hope that His Majesty's Government will be able to give such information to the House as will satisfy the natural anxiety which is growing on this matter, and that they will endeavour not only to get an assurance from the Chinese Government, but an Imperial. Edict so that there shall be not the slightest doubt as to the absolute control of the Inspector-General over the Imperial Maritime Customs Service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01662"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the latter part of his speech the noble Earl seemed to imply that by the creation on May 9, 1906, of this Board of Control or, as I think it is more technically called, Revenue Council, some important change took place in the relations of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service to the Chinese Government, but, as a matter of fact, the changes resulting from the creation of that Council have so far been purely changes of form, departmental changes, because the relations of the Inspector-General to the Council are, exactly the same as those which formerly existed between him and the Wai-wu-pu. The noble Earl has stated what the Revenue Council is. When that Council was created its chief member conveyed an assurance to Sir Robert Hart that the only changes which were involved in its creation related to the manner in which the ordinary reports were to be sent in and to other purely routine matters.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl spoke of the changes in the <i>personnel</i> of the Revenue Council. It of course is common knowledge that Sir Robert Bredon became for a short time a member of the Council, but he has since then, as the noble Earl knows, resigned that appointment, and therefore I do not know that anything special arises out of that. When the Council was created His Majesty's Government entered a protest against its creation because they were quite content with the relations as they existed at the time between the Chinese Foreign Office and the Customs, and they
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0411"/>
<col>771</col>
received a written official assurance from the Chinese Government that the existence of the Revenue Council was to make no change in the Customs administration laid down in the Loan Agreements of 1896 and 1898. Sir Robert Hart issued, by direction of the Revenue Council itself, the circular of September, 1906, to the members of the Customs Service, stating that the two Controllers had explained to him that work was to proceed as before the institution of the Council, and that they had authorised him to announce that the Inspector-General would have the same relations with the Revenue Council as he had had with the Wai-wu-pu, that his duties would continue to follow the same lines, and that the officials would work as heretofore and remain in the same relation to the Inspector-General.<lb/>
It was naturally important that this circular should receive publicity, and His Majesty's Minister at Peking arranged with the Chinese Government that the Revenue Council should officially forward it to the Wai-wu-pu in order that they might authorise the Council to instruct Sir Robert Hart to publish it in the Customs "Quarterly Gazette," which is the regular organ for making announcements and which is circulated and published both in Chinese and in English. In those circumstances, and in view of the fact that no specific instances of interference on the part of the new Board with the Inspector-General have been brought to the notice of the Foreign Office, there does not seem to be, as matters stand at present, any means for addressing further representations to the Chinese Government with regard to the position of the Board. I did not hear the noble Earl say anything about Papers. As a matter of fact, I am informed that there are no Papers of any public interest on the subject since last we laid Papers in 1906. In those circumstances I hope the noble Earl will not ask for Papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01663"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the House is indebted to my noble friend for having brought this matter before our attention. If I may be permitted to say so, he did so in a speech characterised by great clearness and evidently careful study of the intricacies of the question. It is of vital importance to this country that the work done by Sir Robert Hart should be continued and should not have been performed in vain. I was under the impression&#x2014;
<col>772</col>
though I am bound to say that my knowledge of these matters is not very recent&#x2014;that there had been continual attempts on the part of the Chinese Government to set up a Chinese Commission composed of Chinese officials, in a position which would have impaired the authority of the official at the head of the Board of Customs. That was, unless I am mistaken, the real source of contention between His Majesty's Government and the Chinese Government. Now it is quite clear that any arrangement of the kind would be a violation of those pledges and assurances which my noble friend recited during the course of his speech. I am glad to gather from the statement of the noble Earl that His Majesty's Government are, upon the whole, satisfied that this Revenue Council is not intended to usurp functions which did not belong to it before. That, as far as it goes, is satisfactory, but what I did not gather from the noble Earl, and what I cannot help thinking my noble friend desired to elicit, is this. Sir Robert Bredon has resigned, and what he would like to know is whether he is to be replaced by a British official who will be in the same position in relation to the Revenue Council.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01664"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I have no information on that point. But I think it was stated by the Chinese Government that Sir Robert Bredon's appointment was of a purely honorary character.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01696"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the debate on this Bill, the Second Reading of which I now rise to move, may be regarded as a continuation of that which was closed on November 30 last year. It is true that not unimportant circumstances have intervened since in the General Election and in the paralysis of ordinary business which have taken place; but it is the same Bill and the same debate, though destined, as I hope, to have a very different ending from that with which they met on the last day of November last year. I do not propose in thus continuing the debate to do so at any length. I said my say on the former occasion on the general aspects of the Finance Bill, and I do not desire to repeat anything of what I said then. Nor is it necessary, I think, on the present occasion to resume the discussion of the story of financial confusion and loss due, as we say, to the action of your Lordships' House at that time.<lb/>
All that I really have to do to-day is to inform the House how far in a technical sense my statement that it is the same Budget has to be qualified. There are no changes in the provisions of the Bill, but there are certain alterations which have been rendered necessary by the lapse of time that has passed since the Bill was last before Parliament, and upon those I should desire to say a word. In the first place, the Finance Bill has been affected in some degree by legislation which has since been passed. The old Clause 92, which provided that the amount of the permanent annual
<col>776</col>
charge for the National Debt under Section 1 of the Sinking Fund Act, 1875, should during the current and every subsequent financial year be the sum of &#x00A3;24,500,000 instead of &#x00A3;28,000,000, has become unnecessary from the passing of the Borrowing Powers Bill, by which the whole amount ordinarily available for the Sinking Fund was taken over for the current year; and the effect of the omission, of course, is that while the Sinking Fund for the present year is taken over, for future years it will stand at &#x00A3;28,000,000 unless in a future Finance Bill provision is made to alter that amount.<lb/>
The only other alteration due to legislation that has taken place since the rejection of the Finance Bill is little more than a verbal one in Clause 90, due to the passing of the Development Act. Then there are changes, numerous changes, in date, which have become necessary owing to the lapse of time. They are mainly automatic and are to be found all through the Bill. I need only speak of two. In the first place, as regards the licences for motor-cars those will become payable in the month of June, and from the amount then payable will be deducted, of course, the old rate where it has been paid for the current year. So far as regards the liquor licences, those become due also in June as from the last payment, either September 30 or December 31 of last year; but I understand that my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in view of the hardship which may be considered to fall on the licence-holder of having to make two payments within so short a space of time, has promised, as far as possible, that the payment due next year shall be spread over the whole period instead of being called for, as it naturally would be, at the end of next September. The third class of amendments is in Clause 95, which provides for an indemnity in the case of all payments made on account of duty during the interval which has elapsed before the Bill becomes Law.<lb/>
Then I come to the final class of changes in the Bill, which are less strictly automatic but at the same time do not involve any real alterations of its provisions. These are amendments of a declaratory character, intended to clear up doubts which have existed in some minds as to the possible construction of three or four of the clauses;
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0414"/>
<col>777</col>
but they do not in any case change the intention of the framers of the Bill. I am quite willing to admit that so far as these declaratory amendments have any effect&#x2014;I think it is very doubtful whether any of them have any real effect&#x2014;those who will profit by them may take off their hats to your Lordships' House for your action in rejecting the Bill in November last year. The first of these amendments is in Clause 7, and it involves a slight alteration in the terms under which agricultural land is to be exempt from the Increment Value Duty. It has, all through, been our intention that agricultural land should be exempt from that duty. This particular doubt arose from a question well known to noble Lords connected with Ireland, as to whether the economic value and the market value in that country could be taken to mean the same thing. Here we should be disposed to say that it invariably did, but it was argued&#x2014;I confess I do not know with what legal force&#x2014;that there might be cases in which a construction might be put upon "value" which would lead to an increase in agricultural value becoming subject to the Increment Duty, and if these words make it clear that that is not the case they simply carry out our intention throughout.<lb/>
Then in Clause 41, the definition clause, another case arises which applies solely to Ireland. It has reference to the conditions of judicial tenancy. There it was contended&#x2014;again I do not know with what legal force&#x2014;that in certain conditions it might be thought that a judicial tenancy would become subject to the increment charge in relation to an increase in its value, even though it remained a judicial tenancy, because a judicial tenancy, as your Lordships know, although in one sense an annual tenancy, is not a terminable tenancy, and I understand it was upon that point the doubt arose. A very rare combination of circumstances would have been necessary for such a case to arise, even if it could have arisen at all, but as the doubt was supported by some weight of opinion we decided to make our meaning clear. In Clause 61 there is a small alteration with regard to the exemption of statutory tenancies under the Irish Land Act from Death Duty, which carries out the existing practice in every way. In Clause 74 there is a small addition, the design of which is to make it clear that in every case an implied trust, no less than a trust which is a trust
<col>778</col>
on the face of it, escapes duty, which again has always been our intention.<lb/>
These, my Lords, are the only alterations that have been made in the Bill as it came up to your Lordships' House last year. They are none of them material, and but for them the Bill is in all respects identical. The Bill comes up once more with the sanction of the representative House. It has been freely stated that the fact that it has so come up is the result of some kind of bargain.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01698"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: If it were I do not know that there would be anything to be ashamed of in that fact. Certainly five-sixths of the legislation which appears on the Statute Book is the result of a bargain, and it is, indeed, because your Lordships have in so many cases given up the practice, when a Liberal Government is in power, of bargaining with the other House and have preferred to over-ride it, that so much of our present trouble has arisen. It is quite true that no Finance Bill which has ever become law has been equally welcomed in all its clauses by a great number of those who have supported it. We have known cases in which Finance Bills in their progress have been altered in deference to public opinion. Mr. Lowe's Match Tax was one well-known instance and Mr. Goschen's Van and Wheel Tax was another. But as to corrupt or improper bargains, such bargains, unknown as I hope they always have been, and, I trust, always will be, to every Party in this country, would meet with a swift and sure punishment. I say categorically that as far as this Budget is concerned, or any future Budget, there is no bargain of any kind. There is no bargain of any kind on any action that has been taken or might conceivably be taken with reference to the controversy between the two Houses. There is no bargain of any kind with reference to any future legislation on any subject. I say this categorically, and, having said it, I venture to hope we shall hear no more of the accusation.

<image src="S5LV0005P0I0415"/>
<col>779</col>
when not merely any noble Lord, but even a Minister in this House, makes a statement of that kind for it to be accepted as a matter of fact. If the, as I think, rather untimely merriment exhibited by one or two noble Lords opposite indicates that they do not believe what I say, it is clear that no repetition of my statement would have any effect upon them.<lb/>
My Lords, there is only one more point with which I wish to deal. This Finance Bill was accused during its progress through this House before of being a tacked Bill. I do not know whether that charge was ever seriously meant or whether it is seriously pressed now. At any rate we have the satisfaction of knowing that in the opinion of the principal economical and financial authority on the other side of the House, Lord St. Aldwyn, this Bill does not involve tacking. I repeat what I said on a former occasion, that I think that if your Lordships seriously believed this was a tacked Bill you would not pass it on the present occasion, because, so far as tacking is concerned, the mere fact that the Bill was approved by the country at a General Election would be in itself not relevant. As I understand, the main objection taken in this House to tacking is that it interferes with the power of amendment, and the existence of that power could not be affected by anything that took place at a General Election. Therefore I venture to assume that that charge will now be dropped. I ask you, then, to pass this Finance Bill through all its stages to-night. I am aware that there are many of its provisions to which you profoundly object, but we have been told on the authority of the noble Marquess who is able to speak for the majority of this House that on this occasion you will pass it. Before I sit down I desire to say a word of personal apology. I have to-night a long-standing engagement to attend an important public dinner, which I am afraid may take me away from part of the debate. I hope, therefore, that if I am absent when any noble Lord opposite is speaking he will acquit me of any discourtesy towards him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01701">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Crewe.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01702"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who leads the House has given your Lordships a clear account of the changes which this Bill has undergone since it last came before us. I think he
<col>780</col>
was justified when he told your Lordships that those changes were, in his opinion, not material. Nor is it necessary for me to refer to them, unless, perhaps, it be for the purpose of saying that in one case&#x2014;I mean the amendment which has been introduced with the object of making it clear that agricultural land is to be exempt from Increment Duty&#x2014;we are by no means persuaded that the new wording proposed by His Majesty's Government really carries out their intention. That is a matter which can only be decided afterwards when these questions come within the purview of the Courts of Law. The noble Earl at the very outset of his observations expressed a confident hope that the Bill would become law this evening. I certainly am not prepared to suggest that his confidence is misplaced. Last year we withheld our concurrence from this Bill solely with the object of obtaining a reference of it to the constituencies, and now that the constituencies, through the mouths of their representatives in the House of Commons, have expressed themselves favourably to the Bill, we are, I conceive, as honourable men bound by the pledges we have given in and out of this House to acquiesce in the passage of the Bill through all its stages to-night.<lb/>
But I think, nevertheless, that it would be scarcely right that we should part with the Bill without some words of comment from this side. I think we have a right to take note, in the first place, of the extraordinary hesitation shown by His Majesty's Government in bringing this Bill before Parliament. Then we may well note the proceedings of His Majesty's Government during the period of suspense, when apparently they did not know themselves whether they would be able to proceed with the Bill or not. In the next place, I think there is something to be said as to the composition of the majority by which this Bill has been carried through the House of Commons; and lastly as to the methods by which the support of that majority has been procured. These are things which are of importance, not only in themselves, but they are of vital importance to this House because it is only by considering these things as they deserve to be considered that it is possible to form an opinion as to the course taken by your Lordships in the month of December last, and unless these matters are taken into consideration it would be difficult for us to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0416"/>
<col>781</col>
vindicate our conduct as we believe it can and ought to be vindicated.<lb/>
May I for a moment recall to your memory the attitude of this House last winter? This Bill came before us announced by His Majesty's Government as being a Budget Bill unlike any other Budget Bill which had ever been produced in the history of Parliament. No language could have been stronger than that which they employed both in and out of Parliament in dwelling upon the wholly unprecedented and novel character of the proposals which they were going to make. It was not merely that those proposals involved the imposition of heavy burdens upon the taxpayers of this country, but that the incidence of those burdens was distributed in a manner which seemed to most of us wholly indefensible. And pray let it be understood that I am not speaking now of the incidence of these new taxes as between one class of the community and another class, but of their incidence upon individuals within the same class of the community, whether belonging to the more opulent or the less opulent classes. Under this Bill you will find two persons not differing from one another in their ability to pay taxation treated in a wholly different manner. One man, a working man, perhaps, is called upon to pay double, the contribution towards these new liabilities which his neighbour belonging to the same class is called upon to pay; and in exactly the same manner you will find among the wealthier classes one individual taxed far more severely than his neighbour simply because he has chosen to invest his fortune in land instead of in some other form of property. That is indeed what this Finance Bill is to my mind most remarkable for&#x2014;namely, that it introduces us, for the first time, I believe, to the principle of taxation not according to the ability of the individual to pay, but according to the origin of his possessions.<lb/>
There was another point that impressed us greatly. It was impossible to regard this Bill merely as a Finance Bill. It was impossible to talk of it merely as a financial instrument. The Prime Minister himself spoke of its far-reaching political and social results. I take as an illustration of my meaning the taxes falling upon what is commonly spoken of as "the trade," and the taxation of land values. Both of those subjects had come before this House in separate Bills promoted by His Majesty's Govern-
<col>782</col>
ment. Those proposals were now included in this great composite measure which we were asked to pass into law last year. When I am told that this is a purely financial measure, I ask whether, for example, the new Whisky Duty is to be defended merely as a financial measure. I am informed that the new duty has actually produced less than would have been produced had the old duty remained in force. There are no financial results. The tax is a political and not a financial tax. With reference to the remarks made by the noble Earl a moment ago as to "tacking," pray let it be understood that I make these criticisms quite without regard to whether this Bill really comes within the definition of "tacking" given in the well-known Resolution of, I think, 1702. The noble Earl relied on my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn's view that this was not a case of "tacking." Well, I am quite ready to assume that it is not. But that does not in the least prevent me from believing that this Bill cannot be regarded as a purely financial Bill, that it does contain provisions which are not financial but political and social in their objects; and, that, whether there is technically tacking or not, we had a right to pass those proposals in review and to take what action seemed proper to us in regard to them.<lb/>
Another matter which weighed very much with us was this. We believed that it was impossible that these proposals, breathing as they do at every turn hostility to capital, could pass into law&#x2014;could indeed be introduced to the attention of Parliament&#x2014;without creating a dangerous sense of insecurity, in the public mind and seriously affecting the credit of this country. With regard to that my opinion remains unchanged; and when I see that Consols are at this moment quoted below eighty-one, and that they have been falling steadily since the advent to power of His Majesty's Government, at a time when the securities of foreign countries have on the contrary been creeping upwards, I ask myself whether it is not likely that one at any rate of the causes contributing to that result has been the effect upon the public mind of the Budget Bill of 1909. Another ominous symptom bearing upon this part of the case is to be found, I think, in the fact that when a short time ago His Majesty's Government desired to make an issue of Exchequer bonds, they had to close their list, not because they had received all the applica-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0417"/>
<col>783</col>
tions that they desired, but because persons who had applied would have withdrawn their applications if they had had an opportunity of doing so.<lb/>
In these circumstances many of your Lordships were deeply convinced that the great majorities by which this Bill was supported in the other House of Parliament did not truly represent the views of the people of this country in regard to the matter, and we withheld our concurrence. I remain of opinion that this House would have been profoundly unworthy of its position as a Second Chamber had it taken any other course. The right of dealing with measures of this kind is a right indispensable to any Second Chamber in any civilised community, and as a matter of fact it is a right enjoyed, to the best of my belief, by all Second Chambers in all civilised communities, and particularly by our great self-governing Commonwealths under Constitutions which you yourselves have conferred upon them.<lb/>
So much for what I would describe as our moral right to deal with the Finance Bill of last year. But there is the other question&#x2014;that of our constitutional right. I am not going this evening to revive the long controversy which has raged over this part of the case. There have been confident assertions on both sides and apparently irreconcilable differences, but I sometimes wonder whether, after all, the difference of opinion between moderate men on both sides of Parliament is quite so great as people would have us believe. I noticed the other day that the Secretary of State for War said this&#x2014;
<quote>"I quite agree that if you take the constitutional literature of the period&#x2014;</quote>
He was talking then of the older Resolutions which are so often quoted&#x2014;
<quote>"you find it obscure not only on this but on many other points."</quote>
But I will not this evening again pass in review the authorities which have been cited, and I will mention one and only one of them. I cannot but think that if there is any one document to which both sides may not unreasonably appeal, that document is the Resolution of the House of Commons&#x2014;Mr. Gladstone's Resolution&#x2014;passed in 1860 at the time of the controversy in regard to the Paper Duties. That Resolution affirmed three propositions&#x2014;in the first place, that Money Bills had in fact from time to time been rejected by
<col>784</col>
the House of Lords; in the second place, that the right of rejecting such Bills was one which the House of Commons regarded with peculiar jealousy, and that, I must say, seems to be an entirely natural and reasonable feeling; and, thirdly, that the undue exercise of that right was to be deprecated&#x2014;in other words, should be used with very great caution and circumspection. Those are propositions to which I believe many noble Lords on both sides of the House would be ready to subscribe.<lb/>
And let me here remind the House that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, in the debate on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill of last year, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The bare legal right to reject the Budget has not been denied. Some, no doubt, and I do not know that I would quarrel with them, would argue that the bare legal right may on certain occasions be appropriately transformed into a moral duty."</quote>
We naturally cheered that sentiment. The noble Viscount went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Yes; I can imagine a state of things&#x2014;I can imagine it with difficulty&#x2014;which would justify the transformation of a legal right into aspects of moral duty by reason of the wild-cat proposals of a demented House of Commons."</quote>
That passage, which I think is a <i>locus classicus</i> in this controversy, seems to me to bear upon the interpretation which Parliament should place upon Mr. Gladstone's Resolution, and is wholly inconsistent with the theory that the right of this House has lapsed; the only question to be decided on this or any other occasion is a question of degree&#x2014;whether this House was or was not justified in putting that right into operation. I dwell upon this because it seems to me to be one thing to charge us with the injudicious use of a right which we possess, and quite another thing to charge us with the usurpation of a right which does not belong to us.<lb/>
Well, the appeal was made to the country, and we know the result. Speaking frankly, I do not suppose that either side was very well satisfied with that result. It fell short of our expectations. I do not think it can have been entirely agreeable to noble Lords opposite. A distinguished member of His Majesty's Government, Sir E. Grey, soon after the election, announced that, in his view, it was not very conclusive as regards future issues. Another Minister, the Home Secretary, informed the public that Ministers had hesitated to take office, and that they had
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0418"/>
<col>785</col>
finally undertaken great responsibilities with only moderate powers to give effect to them. Surely, if that was so, that in itself is sufficient to justify our hesitation to allow the measure to be passed into law. In the new House of Commons a confident majority of 230 was replaced by a majority of less than 100, which included a body of Irish Members, most of whom voted, if I remember right, against the Second Reading of the Bill and abstained from voting on the occasion of the Third Reading, and who now proclaim that upon the merits they are no great friends of the Budget. What I may term the Nationalist asset was so doubtful that for two long months you did not dare to bring your Budget forward, you, who had pledged yourselves emphatically that your first act would be, if you came into power, the re-introduction of the old Budget.<lb/>
During that period of hesitation you proceeded to deal with the finances of the country in what I can only call a most eccentric manner. You had threatened us with chaos, and without being too uncharitable I suggest that you set yourselves to work to produce chaos. You began by refusing all offers of assistance from your opponents. You did so on grounds which I think were partly frivolous&#x2014;I mean the ground that to accept such co-operation was incompatible with your dignity&#x2014;and partly upon the rather unworthy plea that, if you were to proceed by Resolution to regularise the collection of these taxes, you could not tell, after what had happened with regard to the Budget Bill, that any Bill which you might thereafter found upon the Resolution would not be thrown out by the House of Lords. The noble Earl just now made an appeal, and I listened to his appeal with some sympathy. He hoped that his veracity, at any rate, would not be challenged, and, of course, nobody would dream of challenging it. But might not our good faith, when we made these offers of co-operation, have in the same way been accepted as current coin?<lb/>
It is satisfactory to know that, in spite of all this attempt to engineer chaos, nothing very dreadful has happened to the country. I was reading lately the speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which he congratulated himself and everybody else upon the triumphant manner in which the country had passed through this period of suspense and emergency. If I recollect
<col>786</col>
right the total amount which has been lost, or may be lost, is something like &#x00A3;300,000 of Income Tax, and &#x00A3;350,000 of interest&#x2014;interest which need never have been incurred at all if His Majesty's Government had set to work in a business-like manner to deal with a business transaction. The chaos has at any rate been proved not to be irremediable, and it has not cost those untold millions which we were informed it was going to cost. We have escaped from it by the good sense of the trading community, and, I think, to some extent, owing to the reasonable attitude taken by His Majesty's Opposition.<lb/>
I said a moment ago that, in my belief, the result of the General Election justified the action of your Lordships in suspending the Budget. Why, until a very few days ago, not one of you could have told us whether you had a majority or not. Occasionally the truth about these things is blurted out in a rather inconvenient manner by some of your supporters. Let me read part of a speech delivered a few days ago by a gentleman of the name of Clancy, who, as I understand, is a conspicuous member of the Nationalist Party. Mr. Clancy said&#x2014;
<quote>"I rise on behalf of the Party with which I act to say that we intend to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill, and I may say at once that the reason why I do so, and why we do so, is entirely unconnected with the merits or demerits of the Bill."</quote>
Mr. Clancy goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"I frankly confess that up to a very recent date I felt convinced that we should be obliged to take the opposite course &#x2026; Happily we find ourselves in a position to take the course which I have announced. The unmistakable declaration of the Prime Minister on Thursday night has, in my opinion, completely altered the situation."</quote>
I congratulate His Majesty's Government upon the success, of their diplomacy. It seems to me to have been achieved by the kind of tactics which we might look for, let us say, in Morocco or Somaliland, where allies of doubtful allegiance have to be brought into line by the offer of certain inducements.<lb/>
The noble Earl told us emphatically that there had been no bargain. The word bargain is a little ambiguous. I must say that I have been interested in observing the different lines upon which this question of the existence of a bargain has been dealt with by various apologists of His Majesty's Government. It has been said&#x2014;the noble Earl said so to-night&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0419"/>
<col>787</col>
that bargains of this kind are quite proper and natural. Then I have seen it said by very much the same people that there was no bargain. And, thirdly, it has been said that the bargain might very well have been made rather earlier than it was. After the noble Earl's emphatic disclaimer I shall not for a moment suggest that there was any transaction, signed, sealed, and delivered, between him and his colleagues on the one hand and the Nationalist Members on the other. But I shall await with very great interest the production of the Budget of 1910&#x2013;11. I observe that Mr. Redmond said the other day significantly&#x2014;
<quote>"The Budget of 1910&#x2013;11 has yet to be produced."</quote>
But about that part of the story, I mean the financial inducements said to have been offered to the Nationalist Party, I will say no more.<lb/>
There is, however, another part of the case about which I am obliged to say a word. It seems to me absolutely clear and established beyond possibility of doubt that what carried the day and enabled you to take your Irish allies with you into the Lobby was the statement made by the Prime Minister a very few days ago, "the unmistakable declaration"&#x2014;as it has been called&#x2014;of the Prime Minister. Now I do not believe there is any reason for supposing that the Irish are in favour of a Single Chamber, or that they owe any particular grudge to the House of Lords. But, in their view, these Resolutions for the abolition of the Veto of the House of Lords spell Home Rule for Ireland. Hear what Mr. Redmond said on the 3rd of this month at Tipperary&#x2014;
<quote>"The question at issue is the speedy abolition of the House of Lords, and this means nothing less than Home Rule for Ireland."</quote>
There is a directness of statement about Mr. Redmond which is rather refreshing. He speaks frankly, he sees the thing in its true proportion&#x2014;"The abolition of the House of Lords." Mr. Redmond does not affect to believe, as some of the noble Earl's colleagues do, that the House of. Lords is going to be left under this new dispensation in a position almost equal to that which it now occupies. The House of Lords, then, the only obstacle to Home Rule, was to go. But these gentlemen were not going to be content with a mere announcement of I policy. They required something a great deal more definite than that, and they have got it. They have forced you to disclose not only the end which you have in view,
<col>788</col>
but the means by which you are going to accomplish that end, means which you are going to use in defiance of your own better judgment. Unless we misunderstand the position wholly you have contracted to advise the Crown to coerce one House of Parliament by steps never resorted to since the reign of Queen Anne, and you contemplate these measures, you who have been in the habit of charging us with revolutionary practices and who draw fine-drawn distinctions between legal and constitutional rights.<lb/>
I do not make these allegations without the possibility of proving them. The process of education which His Majesty's Government have gone through can be followed stage by stage with absolute distinctness. Let me remind the House what those stages have been. The first stage was the stage anterior to the General Election. The House will remember the noble Earl's announcement during the debate on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill. He told us then that what would happen was that His Majesty's Government would set themselves to obtain guarantees, not the old guarantees, but guarantees of a different kind. The noble Earl's language was vague and, on the whole, I think, was characterised by a reasonable amount of caution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01703"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The words I used were "statutory guarantees."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01704"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I would not misquote my noble friend. I will read his words&#x2014;
<quote>"We must set ourselves to obtain guarantees&#x2014;not the old guarantees sanctioned by the course of time and enforced by accommodation between the two Houses, but if necessary, if there be no other way, guarantees fenced about and guarded by the force of Statute."</quote>
These words, if I may borrow the simile of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, were the premonitory rumblings of the earthquake. The Prime Minister ten days later was, not more precise, but more emphatic. He announced to the country that His Majesty's Government would not assume office and would not hold office unless they could secure&#x2014;
<quote>"the safeguards which experience shows to be necessary for the legislative utility and honour of the party of progress."</quote>
That intimation attracted very great attention, and it is no exaggeration to say that the General Election was in a great measure fought upon that declaration of the Prime Minister's.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0420"/>
<col>789</col>
Then came the election, with its dubious results&#x2014;the results which made both Sir Edward Grey and the Home Secretary perceive that matters were not going quite so well for them as they had hoped, and there was a period when apparently a chastened spirit prevailed amongst Ministers and their supporters. Let me quote to the House what was said by the Prime Minister on the first day of the present session. Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"To ask in advance for a blank authority for an indefinite exercise of the Royal Prerogative in regard to a measure which has never been submitted to, or approved by, the House of Commons is a request which, in my judgment, no constitutional statesman can properly make, and it is a concession which the Sovereign cannot be expected to grant."</quote>
That was a very remarkable abandonment of what I might call the Albert Hall position, which was wholly different. But a few days later the noble Earl himself contributed a statement, to my mind more remarkable than any of the Ministerial utterances upon this subject. Let me read it to the House. It was made at Winchester on April 5. The noble Earl was referring to the exercise of the Royal Prerogative for creating Peers in order to overcome the resistance of this House, and he said that this was&#x2014;
<quote>"a power which has only once been used, and used to a small extent&#x2026;obviously a power which only ought to be used in the last resort and under circumstances of the most special character."</quote>
Now listen to this&#x2014;
<quote>"It is to my mind altogether improper even to consider such a contingency until the occasion has actually arisen, if it ever does arise, because its exercise must depend upon a great number of issues."</quote>
Then follows a very remarkable passage&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not a question of the Minister's going to the Sovereign and asking the Sovereign to create a certain number of Poers as a favour, but it is the constitutional exercise of the power of advice by the Minister to the Sovereign."</quote>
My Lords, those are obscure but somewhat ominous words. I do not like to comment upon them, but I have yet to learn what is this distinction between that which a Minister may ask of the Crown as a favour, and that which he may ask as the constitutional adviser of the Sovereign. At any rate at that time I shall not be wrong in saying that the noble Earl opposite was penetrated by a sense of the gravity of the step which was under discussion, that he was extremely reluctant to see it adopted, that he did not desire to have it even con-
<col>790</col>
sidered, and that he for one was determined that it should not be adopted save at the last moment, and as a last resort. With that remarkable statement ended the period of moderation. Mine days passed&#x2014;less than nine days&#x2014;and a complete change came over the scene. Something happened; we can easily divine what that something was&#x2014;the something which induced Mr. Clancy to change his mind at the last moment; and we have the full-blown pledge given by the Prime Minister on April 14, a pledge that&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Lords fail to accept our policy, or decline to consider it when it is formally presented to the House, we shall feel it our duty immediately to tender advice to the Crown as to the steps which will have to be taken if that policy is to receive statutory effect in this Parliament."</quote></membercontribution></p>

I have quoted those words&#x2014;I believe I have quoted them accurately&#x2014;because I want to know what has become of the Prime Minister's objection to asking in advance for a blank authority for an indefinite exercise of the Royal Prerogative. What has become of the noble Earl's objection, even to consider such a contingency until the occasion has actually arisen? If these things were improper when the noble Earl made his speech at Winchester on April 5, why is it that they have become proper on April 14? You now have His Majesty's Government not only considering what the noble Earl said they had no business to consider, but announcing to Parliament exactly what they are going to say to the Crown, exactly what they are going to do in all the different eventualities which can be supposed. I must say that a more extraordinary change of front could not have been perpetrated by the responsible advisers to the Crown.<lb/>
Only one word more. I ask your Lordships to note that these guarantees&#x2014;that is
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0421"/>
<col>791</col>
the usual word for them&#x2014;these guarantees, these undertakings to put pressure upon the Crown (because that is the only interpretation that I can put upon the noble Earl's language), are suggested not in order to secure the passage into law of a complete and well-considered measure of constitutional reform, but to obtain a mere fragment of that reform&#x2014;a partial fragment of it dealing only with the powers of this House, neglecting such questions as the constitution of your Lordships' House, neglecting such questions as the possibility of devising better machinery for settling differences when they arise from time to time between one House and the other. All that is left blank, and all that is to be done is to put this House in a position in which it will be absolutely precluded from taking part or lot in the decision of these immense constitutional problems which, by the admission of His Majesty's Government themselves, will have to be solved at some future time. It was the pledge to do these things that saved the Budget. I am quite willing to assume that there was no bargain. If it was not a bargain it was a capitulation&#x2014;a capitulation at the bidding of a faction to whom you have promised, or to whom it has been intimated, that you are ready to overturn the Constitution by unconstitutional means, without having in your minds the smallest idea of that which you intend to put in its place.<lb/>
As to this Bill, we remain convinced that we were acting within our right and acting in accordance with our duty when we asked that it should be referred back to the constituencies, and, if proof is wanted that we were acting within our right and according to our duty, I think it is to be found in the remarkable transactions which I have endeavoured to describe to the House. We, at any rate, have passed through the interesting events of the last few weeks with clear consciences and clean hands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01707"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had intended to commence my observations by saying that we stood in a very different position from that in which we stood when we were last discussing this measure, that we were face to face with a different situation, and that the same considerations were hardly before us. As I listened to the speech of the noble Marquess opposite, particularly to the concluding portion of it, I began to wonder whether the situation really had changed. It was not merely
<col>792</col>
that the noble Marquess was still from our point of view impenitent on the question of the right of this House to reject the Finance Bill, but that he appeared to be arguing in favour of a course, which should, I think, correctly be followed by a vote to reject the Bill again to-night. If the arguments of the noble Marquess have validity, why does he not propose to give expression to them, why are they not carried into effect, and why is the Finance Bill not again to be thrown out?<lb/>
The noble Marquess knows very well, as all your Lordships know, that there is, in fact, a very considerable change in the situation. The Finance Bill has reached this House, after a General Election, backed by a very considerable majority, and an examination such as the noble Marquess has made of the composition of the majority does not alter that basic fact. We are in the normal position of this House when discussing a Finance Bill sent up by a Liberal Government; that is to say, this House is about to-night to pass, so far as the assent of the House is concerned, a Finance Bill of which it entirely disapproves. That, I venture to think, is the normal position of this House in connection with Finance Bills of Liberal Governments. Why the noble Marquess, in the face of that, should continue to say that the power of rejection is not to be exercised I do not know.<lb/>
Your Lordships will remember that a great many speakers in the last debate said that they would not care to be members of a House which was compelled to pass into law measures of which they entirely disapproved, that they would not care to belong to an Assembly of that sort which had no powers, and which had, therefore, lost all dignity. It should be remembered that that is exactly the position before this House to-night. The speech which we have just listened to makes it obvious that the Bill is disapproved of as much as ever. None the less, noble Lords themselves are able to-night, fortunately for the country and fortunately for themselves, to find it consistent with their dignity to pass this measure. The noble Marquess said a great deal about the change of front on the part of Mr. Asquith and the Government in connection with the question of guarantees. It is perfectly obvious that a subject of that character is one of a delicate nature, and one which could only be
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0422"/>
<col>793</col>
discussed with considerable reserve; but I should have thought that the speech of the Lord Chancellor in this House at the commencement of the debate last year made the attitude of His Majesty's Government sufficiently plain, and although there may be slight differences of words here and there I do not see that there has ever been any change from that attitude.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack announced, in the plainest terms, that no Liberal Government would again take office unless they were to be given power to put an end to the opposition of this House. Everything that has happened since has been in pursuance, of that policy, and I think when we come to a later discussion we shall welcome the rather incautious admission of the noble Marquess that the General Election turned very largely on the question of the Veto of this House, because we can hardly be told that that question was not before the electors and decided by them. I desire to-night to discuss not so much the general constitutional question, with which, I think, we have finished, and which I hope will never have occasion to rise again. We are now, as I venture; to think, in the normal position. Members of your Lordships' House stand in a rather peculiar position with regard to taxation. You are taxed without representation, and you stand in exactly the same position in the community as women who own property. You have no powers, except indirectly, to return Members to the other House, and there is no power to deal with questions of taxation when they come up to your Lordships' House. But I do not know that on that account it is necessary for us to be entirely silent on the Bills that come before us. It is possible at any rate to discuss the provisions of such Bills.<lb/>
Last year I felt was an unsuitable time for dealing with any of the details of the Bill, but on this occasion I shall ask the indulgence of the House while I call attention to a portion of the measure which has not been dealt with in this House at all, and which has received very scant attention in the other House&#x2014;I mean the portion which refers to the new taxes on motor-cars. Your Lordships laugh. I think that goes to support my argument. My argument is that classes of the community who are in a minority are apt to have taxation of this sort imposed upon them without adequate
<col>794</col>
discussion or examination, and if ever that could be the case it has been the case in regard to this Bill. The clauses which impose taxation, on motorists received very small consideration in another place, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not give adequate consideration to those who were entitled to speak. In this House those proposals have received no consideration at all, nor, of course, can they receive any effective consideration here. But I want to submit to your Lordships one or two propositions. First of all, I wish to inquire what reason, what logical, defensible reason, there is for the imposition of the taxes at all; secondly, I desire to call attention to the mode in which they have been imposed; and, thirdly, to make one or two observations on the attitude of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<lb/>
Mr. Asquith about three years ago, in his Budget Speech, said the question of the taxation of motor-cars would have to be considered, as they constituted a luxury which was fast degenerating into a nuisance. I do not know whether Mr. Asquith would be prepared to repeat those words to-day. I read the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to find out on what ground he founded his claim to tax motor-cars. It consisted partly of the suggestion that they were a luxury and that they wore out the roads. As to their being a luxury, that is hardly true at the present day; and if it were true, there would hardly seem any reason why other luxuries should not be taxed. The expensive landaus that we see in the park drawn by expensive horses are luxuries, racehorses are luxuries, many other things are luxuries. But it is not proposed to put a tax on racehorses. As a motorist I see no reason why they should not be taxed at least as much as motor-cars.<lb/>
I now come to the question of wearing out the roads. We have definitely abandoned in our system of the maintenance of roads what I would call the turnpike idea, the idea that the vehicles using the roads are to be taxed per vehicle. When we abolished that system we came, I take it, to the conclusion that the roads should be national and should be supported, as they are, by local areas. I have always urged that the area should be a larger one, and that there should be certain national roads; but, at any rate, we came to the conclusion that at roads as a whole were for the benefit of the whole community. I regard the proposed tax on motor-cars which
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0423"/>
<col>795</col>
is brought into force by this Bill as a retrograde step; it is a sort of octroi tax on the individual. If vehicles using the roads are to pay a tax as vehicles, it is logical to argue that that should apply to all vehicles. In this matter the Chancellor of the Exchequer has adopted a line of argument which I can only describe as adroit. He began by assuring motorists that not a penny of this money would go to local authorities. Motorists were to consent to the taxation because it was going to be spent for their own purposes and for the improvement of the roads. Later in the history of his Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to meet a deputation of local authorities, and he assured them that this taxation would make them &#x00A3;200,000 or &#x00A3;300,000 a year better off, and later he said it would do so by relieving them of improvements which they would otherwise have to make. I venture to think that the two arguments are not consistent.<lb/>
There is a great deal less to be said than otherwise because of the attitude of motorists themselves. Motorists have been given away by their organisations, and have not taken the steps they might have taken to obtain justice. The description which the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave on introducing these proposals, that they had the assent&#x2014;he was careful not to say the enthusiastic assent&#x2014;of motorists themselves is hardly correct. At that time the negotiations which had been proceeding were not known, but since then it has come out that what in effect happened was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent for certain distinguished persons, who assumed to speak on behalf of the whole class of motorists, and said to them, "I am going to tax you so much. How will you have it found?" One of the representatives said it was not a question of whether they would be birched, but on what part of the body they should be birched. That is what the Chancellor of the Exchequer may call assent, but it is assent in precisely the same sense as your Lordships will assent to this Bill to-night. There are certain persons who should have been consulted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. This trade was begun in this country under difficulties. Your Lordships all know that in the beginning it was retarded by legislation which made it difficult to introduce locomotion of this kind into this country. Those difficulties were to some extent removed, but they never
<col>796</col>
have been removed to the extent to which they are removed in France. But in spite of the difficulties put in the way, a very large and important trade has grown up in this country giving employment to an enormous number of persons, and a trade of that sort ought to have been consulted.<lb/>
There exists an organisation called the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It is the official trade society of the whole country, and it embraces practically every trader of any consequence in motor vehicles in this country. One would have thought that a Chancellor of the Exchequer like Mr. Lloyd-George, who professes himself so solicitous for the trade of the country, would at least have taken some opportunity of learning the views of this trade before inflicting upon it the severe injury which Ms taxes entail. I have in my hand the annual report of the society to which I refer, and I find therein this statement&#x2014;
<quote>"Although every step was taken to bring to the notice of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury the position of the society as the recognised representative body of the industry, the society's proposed deputation was never received, nor was any reason vouchsafed for the refusal to receive it. That is all the more extraordinary when it is remembered that deputations were received in the same connection. The society went to great trouble to compile facts showing in what directions the taxation in the Budget affected the industry, and offered to submit to the Chancellor of the Exchequer the original proofs."</quote>
I think the trade have a right to complain that it has received no hearing. It is true that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was then occupied with other proposals, but there has been a very considerable interval since, during which he might have ascertained the views of this industry.<lb/>
Coming to the Bill itself, I find in it the most extraordinary provisions, to which the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been called by deputation and otherwise, and which no attempt has been made to remedy. First, as to the definition of "motor spirit" on which a tax is to be paid. The expression "motor spirit" is defined in the Bill as meaning&#x2014;
<quote>"Any inflammable hydrocarbon (including any mixture of hydrocarbons and any liquid containing hydrocarbon) which is capable of being used for providing reasonably efficient motive power for a motor car."</quote>
It has been pointed out to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that that includes ordi-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0424"/>
<col>797</col>
nary lamp oil and paraffin; it includes coal burnt in a steam-car; it includes also wood and coke. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was urged to give some reasonable interpretation of motor spirit and a definition was suggested to him, but nothing has been done to make that clear. I also find that the Bill imposes upon dealers in motor spirit a licence duty of 5<i>s</i>. Those dealers are, in fact, licensed already. Everyone of them has to be licensed now by the local authority, and I do not know whether the Excise have any real excuse for making them pay an additional duty and enter upon an additional register. Nor do I discover that any discussion on that point took place in the other House.<lb/>
When you come to the tax on motor-cars themselves&#x2014;on the carriages&#x2014;you find there a tax on the scale of horse-power. The eminent persons whom the Chancellor of the Exchequer consulted had some little fad of their own, and they submitted scales to the Chancellor which apparently he swallowed. To tax on a scale of horse-power is bad. The Royal Commission which sat upon the subject of motor-cars recommended against it, and suggested that taxation by weight should be adopted. It has been pointed out that if horsepower is to be the scale, then the taxes should rise by an increase of one horse-power at a time instead of having artificial jumps at particular places, which would have the effect of leading to undesirable sizes being standardised and inflict injury upon the trade. Although an interval has elapsed which has given time for that to be considered, nothing has been done in that respect, nor has any intimation been given that anything will be done. In that connection I should like to say that I think probably no motorists, or at any rate very few motorists, in this country would object to the tax on high-power cars. There is a general feeling that persons who choose to use cars of a racing horse-power are persons who can afford to pay this tax. I do not think any objection has been offered to the tax on racing cars, but the tax on ears of small horse-power will be most oppressive. In the case of the doctor the Chancellor of the Exchequer has recognised that, by allowing him a rebate of one-half. There is no reason why the doctor should have this rebate any more than anyone else. It is purely a sentimental reason. No rebate, however, is
<col>798</col>
given to the surveyor or estate agent, or even to the commercial traveller. The class of person who uses a motor-car over the country roads for pleasure has almost ceased to exist. Cars are now used for a definite purpose, and in the case of persons who use motor-cars in a business way the tax is most excessive.<lb/>
To my mind one of the worst features in the whole of this Bill in that connection is the way in which this horse-power is to be calculated. The Bill provides that the unit of horse-power shall be calculated in accordance with the regulations made by the Treasury for the purpose. That is imposing by Statute taxation of an absolutely unknown amount. It is not said that the horse-power is to be a real horse-power, but a horse-power calculated in connection with some formula to be put forward by the Treasury. I submit that it is not right that an Act of Parliament should impose taxation and leave the amount of the tax to be fixed entirely at the discretion of a Department. The House of Commons in the days when it was less under the control of the Cabinet than it is now would not have agreed to these taxes without indicating what would be regarded as motor spirit and what scale would be adopted in calculating horse-power. During the months that have elapsed there has been ample time for these points to be settled. There has been ample time for an announcement to be made by the Treasury as to what they will actually regard as motor spirit; and also as to what formula they are going to use in calculating horse-power; but nothing whatever has been done. Then there is a clause which has been put in at the instance, I believe, of the Army Motor Reserve, with the concurrence of the War Office, under which they are to have a reduction, if they use their car six days in the year for military purposes, of 6&#x2013;365ths of their tax. Is it worth while offering 5<i>s</i>. or 6<i>s</i>. reduction on their cars to people who lend them for the purposes of national defence?<lb/>
I know your Lordships feel that this matter is not exactly relevant to the debate before us and that we cannot discuss it effectively, but the matter has not been properly ventilated, and I felt bound to say what I know to be the feeling of the great bulk of motorists in the country on this question. They are oppressed because they are in a minority. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said this
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0425"/>
<col>799</col>
was a most popular tax. I daresay that if it was proposed that every member of your Lordships' House should pay a tax of &#x00A3;10,000 it would be very popular with those who do not sit here. That does not seem to be a very statesmanlike reason for imposing such a tax. The fault of the whole of this taxation is the want of logic in the imposition of it. The Development Act is the bribe which was dangled before motorists, but that Act, apparently, is going to be used now for doing things that the local authorities ought to do, and there are, apparently, to be no great improvements and no national roads. For these reasons I venture to think that this tax is unfortunate and constitutes a blemish upon a Bill which otherwise I welcome very heartily&#x2014;a Bill the passage of which is going to be one of the greatest assets in the history of the Liberal Party.<lb/>
The, noble Marquess opposite asked what we were going to do, and when we were going to do this and that. The Government have been engaged in the task of what is technically known as making the will of the people prevail. I am not over-fond of the expression "will of the people" in view of the fact that one-third only of the adult population of the country have the suffrage. When you say the "will of the people" you mean the will of those who have votes, and those who have votes in this country wish to make their will prevail. That is the object undoubtedly of all the discussion that has taken place, and your Lordships, by your action last year, raised that question in an acute form, and everything that has been said since has had relation to this question. On those matters we shall doubtless have another discussion soon on another issue, when we shall consider how that is to be done. But while in any event, even with the theoretical power of rejecting Finance Bills, we have no power to amend them but have to submit to any taxation the Commons impose, I think we ought not to be deprived of the right of criticism, and that is why I have ventured to make these few remarks this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01708"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate so far has been of a varied character. It was rather a far cry from a constitutional revolution to the grinding oppression under which motorists are suffering. One thing comes quite clearly out from the speech to which we have just listened, and that is
<col>800</col>
that in the noble Earl's opinion the will of the people has not prevailed as regards the motor taxes. My own view is that it is useless to fight the battle of the Budget over again. Moreover, after the eloquent and convincing speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition there is not much to be said on the general aspect of the question. I wish, therefore, to confine my remarks to one special point. I refer to the recent operations in connection with the Sinking Fund. I allude to this question not so much with a view to criticising the actions of the past, but rather with a view to sound a note of warning in respect of the future.<lb/>
So far as I understand the facts, they are somewhat as follow. When the late Unionist Government went out of office there was a fixed charge on account of the Debt of &#x00A3;28,000,000, which left a very handsome provision&#x2014;I cannot say at this moment how much&#x2014;to be used for the reduction of debt. In the early part of their career the present Government followed with commendable assiduity the policy of reducing debt which had been initiated by their predecessors. In three years something like &#x00A3;40,000,000 was paid off, with the result that in the &#x00A3;28,000,000 fixed charge at the beginning of the last financial year no less a sum than &#x00A3;10,000,000 was provided for the Sinking Fund. That was before the period when the full tide of reckless and extravagant expenditure had set in. Subsequently the Sinking Fund was reduced, first by &#x00A3;3,000,000, and then by &#x00A3;500,000. Many high financial authorities were of opinion that the Sinking Fund should have been maintained at the high level at which it had previously existed until the National Debt had been reduced to the amount at which it stood previous to the South African War. I am quite free to admit that from a purely financial view there was a great deal to be said in favour of that, but it was really a counsel of perfection. It was really almost impossible, considering the high demands made for naval expenditure and for social reform, that this very high standard of financial virtue should have been preserved. Therefore the Chancellor of the Exchequer reduced the Sinking Fund by &#x00A3;3,500,000. I confess I was rather sorry to see that last half million go. At the same time I do not think in all the circumstances of the case that the reduction can be said to be excessive.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0426"/>
<col>801</col>
My principal reason for addressing the House this evening is that I wish to express the very earnest hope that, whatever may be the future course of financial legislation, there will be no further tampering with the Sinking Fund, and that the fixed charge will be not less than &#x00A3;24,500,000, thus leaving about &#x00A3;6,500,000 for the reduction of debt. The mater is one of very great importance. We are too apt to forget that financial preparation is quite as important as either naval or military preparation to meet any great national emergency which may occur. Moreover, it is of especial importance at this moment, for, without going into any details, it cannot be doubted that the measures recently adopted by His Majesty's Government have weakened financially our capacity for meeting a national emergency. I say that because as regards the Death Duties we are notoriously, to a certain extent, living on our capital; and as regards the Income Tax, it is now at so high a figure that it cannot be looked upon to the same extent as hitherto as a safe fiscal reserve. It has also to be remembered that we cannot safely rely to any great extent on what is known as the old Sinking Fund. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in another place a short time ago made a statement, which I willingly admit was of a generally satisfactory nature, as regards the finances of the last year; but I may, in passing, remark that when the right hon. gentleman spoke of a surplus of from &#x00A3;2,500,000 to &#x00A3;3,000,000 he was drawing on his imagination. No such surplus exists unless the Sinking Fund is drawn upon to the extent of another &#x00A3;2,700,000, and that would be a very objectionable course. As far as I can make out, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer collects all the sums he expects to collect his surplus will be about &#x00A3;250,000; in other words, it may be said, roughly, that the revenue and expenditure of last year balance. Then we all know that we are threatened with a further great increase in expenditure both on account of naval charges and social reforms. This being the case, it certainly does appear to me that it would not be safe to rely to any large extent on the old Sinking Fund, and our main reliance must be placed on the new Sinking Fund.<lb/>
There is another point to be borne in mind. Whatever may be the causes, it cannot be doubted that our borrowing power has been impaired. Of that I think
<col>802</col>
there can be no manner of doubt. One has only to look at the price of Consols to be satisfied of that. That is a very important point, for when we consider the high rate of taxation which now exists it cannot be doubted that in a case of great national emergency occurring we shall have to rely in future on borrowing to a greater extent than formerly. Hence the urgent necessity of reducing the Debt in time of peace. The causes which have weakened our borrowing power are very diverse, and I admit it is difficult to differentiate between them and to put one's finger on one special cause for the depreciation in Consols. At the same time I wish to say that some of the pleas put forward in palliation of the depreciation of our credit have been inadequate, and are, to say the least, not satisfactory.<lb/>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, when it was pointed out that Consols had gone down more than six points, that it was entirely due to two special and temporary causes, for both of which your Lordships were responsible. In the first place, the right hon. gentleman said that owing to the rejection of the Budget the money which should have been available for the Sinking Fund was not there, and therefore purchases could not be undertaken in the open market to sustain the price of Consols. I must say that that argument came to me rather as a shock, and I asked myself whether we had got to the stage when the National Debt of England, which should be the highest and finest security in the world, should be treated like the shares of an oil or rubber company, whose price has to be sustained by what is vulgarly called "rigging the market." Surely that would be a very humiliating confession to make. The Chancellor of the Exchequer alleged another cause. He said that owing to the rejection of the Budget by your Lordships' House there had been large temporary borrowings, which had depreciated the price of Consols. I do not doubt that this is the case, but there would have been no cause for temporary borrowings if His Majesty's Government had collected the Income Tax in due time and season, as they were frequently pressed to do both in and out of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Independently of these two causes, and accepting the pleas of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what they are worth, I maintain that it can be shown that there has been
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0427"/>
<col>803</col>
a very heavy fall in the price of Consols. In order to ascertain what has happened I will take two periods&#x2014;August 31, 1908, three or four months after the present Chancellor of the Exchequer took office, and August 31, 1909. At this last-mentioned date the Budget had not come to your Lordships' House, and therefore any action we might take could not have influenced the price of Consols at that time; the Sinking Fund purchases were going on, and there had been no large temporary borrowings. At that time the floating debt amounted to &#x00A3;22,000,000 against &#x00A3;41,000,000 on April 26 of this year. I should like to draw attention to that figure of &#x00A3;41,000,000. It is an enormous sum. There is no part of our financial system which requires more careful watching than the growth of the floating debt, and I think I must be very near the mark when I say that there has been no record in recent times of the floating debt accumulating to such an extent.<lb/>
To revert to my argument. In comparing these two dates&#x2014;August 31, 1908, and August 31, 1909&#x2014;I find that Consols fell in that year from eighty-six and three-eighths to eighty-three and five-eighths, while during the same period the Stocks of other great nations rose. The French Rentes rose one and a-half per cent.; the German Threes two per cent.; the Russian Fours three per cent. The Prime Minister declared, in a debate in the other House last evening, that these comparisons are quite fallacious, and that other special causes have contributed to depreciate Consols which have not applied in France, Germany, and Russia. The Prime Minister specially indicated the large scope which had recently been given to trust securities and the large demands which had been necessary on the market for South African and Irish purposes. I quite admit that many of those pleas are valid. They may have contributed to the fall in the price of Consols. It is impossible to differentiate and to say to what extent; but for all that I cannot help thinking that there is one cause to which the Prime Minister very naturally did not allude, and that is that the financial policy of His Majesty's Government has shaken the confidence of the Money Market.<lb/>
As your Lordships know, confidence is a plant not only of very slow growth, but it is a plant that needs to be carefully nurtured; and I think he would be indeed a bold man who would assert positively that the action
<col>804</col>
of His Majesty's Government has not tended to wither that plant and to stunt its growth. The Chancellor of the Exchequer remarked that the idea that our credit had been shaken was a pure delusion of Tariff Reformers. I wish to remark that I am not a Tariff Reformer. I am a Free Trader; and I wish to say, as a Free Trader, that on this particular point I am very much inclined to share the apprehensions of the Tariff Reformers. This is all I have to say on this subject. I repeat that my principal object in rising has been not to criticise but to warn, and I do wish to express the most earnest hope that the importance of the matter will not be lost sight of, that a strenuous endeavour will be made to reduce the Debt, and that there will be no further tampering with the Sinking Fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01709"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not detain the House for more than a moment, but I rise to make an observation with reference to the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Russell. Personally I disagree with the noble Earl in thinking that motorists in general resent this taxation. As a body we are prepared to accept the taxation proposed, but we do ask His Majesty's Government to carry out their arrangements with regard to the Road Board and I hope that the noble Earl the Leader of the House will be able to tell us this evening the names of the members of the Road Board, or at any rate some of them. No less than &#x00A3;750,000 is going to be raised from a very small number of motorists, and I think His Majesty's Government will admit that we have assisted them in every reasonable way we could in ascertaining how these taxes can be best raised in order that they shall not injure the industry or be hard upon any individual. The Road Board was promised as the first step towards the I nationalisation of the roads and the improvement of highways; but His Majesty's Government have not seen fit to give us the names of the members of the Road Board or any idea of its composition. What Lord Russell stated with regard to the system of levying the tax by horse-power was quite correct. No regular system has yet been instituted. The words in the Bill as they stand are exceedingly vague, and I agree with the noble Earl entirely when he said that the classification as arranged will not be of advantage to the industry, but will entail hardship on certain classes of people. I will not detain your Lordships longer, but I would ask the noble Earl who leads the

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01711"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am well aware that it is the usual custom in your Lordships' House not to have a prolonged debate on the Budget Bill when it is sent up from another place; but the career of the Bill which your Lordships are going to pass to-night has been of so remarkable a character that it is but right and due, in justice to the dignity of your Lordships' House after the course you took last November, that we should be empowered at any rate to criticise its details. My noble friend the Leader of the Opposition dealt so fully with the action of your Lordships' House in November last that it would be superfluous for me to add anything to what he said, but I do endorse fully what fell from him; and I would point out that if ever your Lordships in the annals of your history were justified in taking a strong course, you were justified in the course you then took, for your action in November last has been to my mind endorsed in the House of Commons.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite, in the course of a speech which concluded by an eloquent peroration on behalf of motorists, asked why, if we hold the views we do hold regarding this Budget, we are going to pass it to-night. My answer to that is the answer made by the noble Marquess. He stated clearly that if the Budget Bill, having been referred to the country&#x2014;it was never rejected in your Lordships' House but only referred to the country&#x2014;did pass the new House of Commons, he would then advise those whom he led to pass the Bill when it came up again to your Lordships' House. During the few moments that I propose to trespass on your Lordships' time I want to deal with the manner in which this
<col>806</col>
Budget Bill has passed through the House of Commons. The Prime Minister said that the first act of the new House of Commons would be to reimpose all the taxes and duties embodied in the Finance Bill, and the present Home Secretary declared that the Budget would be run through the House of Commons. So far from this being the case, a good deal of time has been occupied in passing the measure through the House of Commons, and, as we have gathered from the speech of the noble Earl the Leader of the House, it has undergone a certain amount of alteration.<lb/>
What was the reason for the delay in passing the Budget Bill through the House of Commons if it was not that given by my noble friend behind me&#x2014;that there had to be a certain amount of bargaining? The excuse may be that the procedure and forms of the House of Commons delayed the passing of the Budget Bill, but if that were the case ought not those objections to have been foreseen before the Prime Minister and his colleagues made the statements which I have just quoted? I cannot but think that the real reason for the delay in carrying out the pledges of the Prime Minister and forcing the Budget Bill through the House of Commons was that after the General Election the Government were very doubtful indeed whether they had a majority in favour of the Budget, and if they had introduced it in the early part of the session it would not have passed through the House of Commons. Having regard to that fact, I hold that your Lordships were amply justified in your action last November in referring the matter to the country. Of course, we on this side of the House do not know how the majority which helped to carry this Bill through the House of Commons was secured. May I ask what the object of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was in negotiating with the respective sections of the Irish Nationalist Party? I do not think any one who heard the discussion in the House of Commons and the differences of opinion that existed between Mr. O'Brien and the Chancellor of the Exchequer can have considered that those negotiations were of a very edifying character. Surely if the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been sure of his majority after the General Election he need not have carried on those negotiations, because he would have been certain of being able to carry through his Budget.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0429"/>
<col>807</col>
It has been denied that there was any bargain&#x2014;in fact, the noble Earl opposite rather took umbrage with some of us on this side of the House for thinking that there was. Of course, as my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition wisely said in the course of his speech, there was no question of a treaty signed, sealed and delivered; but is it not possible to come to an understanding without all that? I have read with great admiration the literary work of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, and I would like to quote from his able and brilliant Life of Mr. Gladstone. The passage I suppose, refers to the Kilmainham Treaty. The noble Viscount wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. Gladstone was always impatient of any reference to reciprocal assurances or outside understandings in connection with the prisoner at Kilmainham. Still, the nature of the proceedings was plain enough."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01712"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: I have seen that passage quoted in the newspapers. If those who quote it would be kind enough to read the whole page, or even half the page, they would see that it refers to the negotiations or arrangements entered into with an emissary of Mr. Parnell, and has no bearing here. Whatever construction you like to put on these events, there is no kind of analogy or force in that illustration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01713"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I took the quotation from <i>The Times</i>, and I apologise for not knowing the passage better. I pass on to what the Government had to give to obtain a majority of votes in the House of Commons. The Government had to obtain the support of Mr. Redmond and his followers if they were to carry through their Budget. They knew quite well that the people of Ireland and Mr. Redmond and his supporters were mot only indifferent, but to a great extent hostile, to the Budget. Therefore there had to be some negotiations between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the followers of Mr. Redmond. What had the Government to offer to them? They had to offer Mr. Redmond in return for his support of the Budget that they would take steps to abolish the legislative power of the House of Lords, which would give Mr. Redmond all he wanted&#x2014;namely, Home Rule for Ireland. There was no secret about it. The Nationalists did not hesitate to say, in speeches in Ireland, that
<col>808</col>
the Prime Minister, when once he had abolished the legislative power of this House, was going to give Ireland Home Rule. Mr. Redmond never hesitated to say what was the price he set upon his support. His speech was quoted by my noble friend behind me. Mr. Redmond clearly laid down at Tipperary the terms on which his support and that of his followers could be obtained, and it is a curious thing that a short time afterwards the Prime Minister delivered a speech which it would not be unfair to describe as a plagiarism of Mr. Redmond so similar were the two statements. And yet we are told there was no agreement whatever between Mr. Redmond and the Government! Surely to any thinking man it must be rather extraordinary to see the way in which the two opinions, at one time so different, of the Prime Minister and Mr. Redmond came to converge.<lb/>
At the beginning of the session the Prime Minister declared that to ask in advance for a blank authority for an indefinite exercise of the Royal Prerogative in regard to a measure never submitted to or approved by the House of Commons was a request which no statesman could properly make and which the Sovereign could not grant. Yet what do we find at the present moment? What is it that Mr. Asquith is going to ask for? What is he going to ask the exercise of the Royal Prerogative for unless it is for what he calls "this measure which has never been submitted to the House of Commons?" We know full well that Resolutions have been submitted to and carried through the House of Commons by means of the gag used in a very free manner, but I do not think any one will for a moment contend that Resolutions are synonymous with a Bill. There is another change in the attitude of the Prime Minister. At the beginning of the session he declared that he would not take the Resolutions respecting the Veto of the House of Lords first; but a short time after that, Mr Redmond having announced that he would not be a party to that, the Prime Minister said that the Resolutions and not the Budget would be submitted first to the House of Commons. There must have been some negotiations and some reason for such a remarkable change.<lb/>
What was the <i>quid pro quo</i> given to Mr. Redmond for his supporting the Budget? The attitude of Mr. Redmond
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0430"/>
<col>809</col>
on the Budget has been indefinable, certainly very changeable, and, if I may use the word, squeezable. I read Mr. Redmond's remarks in Dublin on February 10. He then said&#x2014;
<quote>"If Home Rule is put on one side, then I will fight the Budget, and if it is a question of the Budget and Home Rule I will accept the Budget."</quote>
Therefore the Budget is quite a secondary object with Mr. Redmond. He has admitted that he abstained from voting against the Budget when it was before the House of Commons last year, not because he did not oppose it but because he knew that it was going to be defeated by the House of Lords, and to have voted against the Budget would, he said, have been giving them a show of additional justification for their action. That Mr. Redmond did not want to do, since he desired the House of Lords out of the way in order to clear the way for Home Rule. You now know exactly what has been the price paid to Mr. Redmond for the support of himself and his followers. The price paid for that support is the destruction of the Constitution of this country, under which for so many years we have lived happily, prosperously, and freely. In any other country but this, if there was any proposal of making an inroad into the Constitution, no such alteration would be made without the most careful thought, the most elaborate preparations, and without the country being appealed to on that question. All this is done here in the course of a few weeks to secure the support of Mr. Redmond and his followers in order to carry the Budget through the House of Commons and maintain His Majesty's Government in power for a few months longer.<lb/>
The men for whose sake the dismemberment of the Empire and the destruction of the Constitution are promised are not men who have any care for England. Mr. Redmond and his friends make no secret of their dislike of England and of their desire to be out of the country. Yet it is with these men that the Government have negotiated and for whom the Constitution of this country is to be sacrificed. The bargain&#x2014;I cannot help calling it so&#x2014;has been made nominally with Mr. Redmond. The Constitution is to be sacrificed nominally to Mr. Redmond. But Mr. Redmond is merely an intermediary. He is subservient to his paymaster, Mr. Patrick Ford, a man who was found by the Parnell Commission to be
<col>810</col>
guilty of advocating crime and even the use of dynamite. Therefore when we see these negotiations completed, I think we on this side, particularly those who belong to Ireland and know what the Union means to Ireland, are justified in saying that the country has been sold to no less a person than Mr. Patrick Ford. When the Act of Union was passed the Government of the day were accused of carrying it by means of corruption. I entirely deny that. But I venture to say that bribery and corruption&#x2014;moral, of course, and I might almost say immoral&#x2014;have been the only means by which this Budget has been carried through the House of Commons. A writer of past history has told us of a famous Government-known as the "Who Who" Government. The historian of the future will describe this as the "Wait and See" Government. And what are we waiting to sec? We are waiting to see this Government dragged down to a depth of degradation darker and deeper than has ever before been recorded in the annals of history.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01714"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the whole of this debate has been tame, notwithstanding the efforts made at the conclusion of the speech of the noble Marquess to infuse a little more fire into it. The tempest of last November has indeed dwindled to a calm, yet I think a few words ought to be said on an occasion of this kind, because within twenty-four hours from now there will be concluded the first stage of the dangerous controversy into which this House was ill-advised and unwise enough to plunge the country last November. The Bill will pass into law, and in the course of a very short time it will be regarded as an unmixed benefit to the people of this country by all parties in the State.<lb/>
That being the occasion of this debate, I was a little surprised that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition made a curious and I think rather untimely excursion into the constitutional question which was debated last November&#x2014;whether or not this House had the constitutional right to throw out the Budget. Upon that territory I shall not trespass for one moment That matter has been fully discussed and debated, and has become one of those practical things now to be settled definitely by law one way or another. It can no longer be left in a nebulous and uncertain state. I will say, not of that subject, but of the way it was treated by the noble Marquess
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0431"/>
<col>811</col>
one word. I think that he, with his high authority, has been giving sanction, and not for the first time, to a very hazardous doctrine. He spoke of the fine distinction drawn between what is legal and what is constitutional in this country. He has happily not been obliged to study the works of constitutional writers; he has not remembered, I think, the speeches of many statesmen on both sides of the House for a period of 150 years&#x2014;Lord Lyndhurst, Burke, Chatham, Pitt, Walpole, and Peel. I do not care what statesman you search the speeches of. I defy you to search the speeches of any of the great statesmen without finding his recognition of the fact that the difference between what is legal and what is constitutional lies at the very root of the government of this country. Think of what are the relations between the Crown and the Ministers of the Crown: the whole thing rests on what is constitutional as distinguished from what is legal. If the legal powers of the Crown were exercised in this country without the responsibility of Ministers, what becomes of your boasted Constitution?<lb/>
Why did the noble Marquess enter upon this excursion at all? I am afraid I must say it was really rather for purposes of diversion. It is unintelligible upon any other ground, because the question that really arises now on his part is how he can defend the advice he, as Leader of the majority of this House, gave the House last November. He has said to-night very little about the merits of the Budget, and there is very little to be said&#x2014;or rather there is very little to be said on an occasion like the present one, unless you dwell on its demerits, and those are few. The noble Marquess has surely forgotten what he himself stated as a reason for advising the throwing out of the Budget. I have not had time to refer to the text of his speech, because I was not aware that I was going to take part in the debate, but am I not right in saying that he stated somewhere in the West of England that his reason for advising it was that he thought the Budget would be destructive of Tariff Reform?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01715"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: One amongst many reasons given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01716"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I think that was the main reason. It was not a bit on account of the different classes which are thought to be discriminated between un
<col>812</col>
fairly by this Budget. It was not because the burden would fall upon one class or the other; it was not sympathy or pity for individuals of different classes upon whom differential taxation would fall, some of them, perhaps, working men, that was the predominant motive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01717"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: If the noble and learned Lord challenges me, I say that in the speeches to which he referred I used both arguments. I used the argument that the new policy of His Majesty's Government was destructive of Tariff Reform, but I also dwelt fully on the other argument founded on the inequitable incidence of the new taxation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01718"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I fully accept that statement. But I do not think that the predominant motive was the fear of this or that tax being proposed, not any anxiety for constitutional doctrine, but the belief that this policy would be destructive of what I cannot help regarding as the pernicious doctrine of Tariff Reform, to which the noble Marquess has given his assent. But now look for one moment at the effect of that statement. We were a Government of whose time only eighteen months or two years had to lapse. We had an enormous majority in the House of Commons. If we had been a Conservative Government we should have been perfectly safe, because there is no chance of anything being done in this House to interfere with the life of a Conservative Government. But we were a Liberal Government.<lb/>
Let me state frankly, without intending any offence, the charge we make against this House. It is that your Lordships have watched our footsteps, the footsteps of all Liberal Governments of recent years, and have endeavoured to trip us up by the heels when a convenient opportunity arose. That is the distinction between the treatment of a Liberal Government and the treatment of a Conservative Government by this House. If the power were impartially used, if there were fair play, if a sporting chance were given to a Liberal Government by this House as at present constituted, there would not be the bitter feeling that there is in many parts of the country owing to this want of impartiality. I hope the result of the Budget if it becomes law will be the defeat and ruin of Tariff Reform. Whether that will be so or not I do not know, that may depend on other and future elections, but
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0432"/>
<col>813</col>
so long as this millstone is hanging round the neck of the Conservative Party, they will never be able to obtain a majority in the constituencies of the country.<lb/>
I will now turn for a few moments to another matter. The noble Marquess suggested that His Majesty's Government had capitulated to the Irish Nationalists and had bought at a corrupt price&#x2014;it was so suggested by Lord Londonderry&#x2014;the passage of this Bill. Will your Lordships kindly face the facts? We live in this country under a Party system; that means that the Government are bound to rely upon the support of the House of Commons, and if the House of Commons will not support it, the Government, to whichever side it belongs, must cease to exist. Are we not to ascertain what are the opinions on the great public Bills and questions that come before Parliament of all sections in the House of Commons? Is there any Minister who has sat in the House of Commons either on the Conservative or the Liberal side who will deny that this is necessarily and inevitably done by both Governments? Mr. Balfour, on that memorable occasion when there was a dispute between Mr. O'Brien on the one side and Mr. Lloyd-George on the other, said in the House of Commons, like a man of honour that he is, that it is impossible to carry on a Government unless you ascertain the opinions of the members of the House of Commons on the other side&#x2014;opponents as well as friends. On that occasion Mr. Lloyd-George did endeavour to obtain not only the opinions of Nationalists but the opinions of supporters of His Majesty's Government, and I believe, though I cannot pledge myself to this, the opinions of any members of the Opposition who were willing to see him and wished to discuss this or any other question with him. He did so, but he had no authority, as he told the House of Commons, to make any arrangement. If any agreement had been arrived at it would have had to be confirmed by the Cabinet. All I can state is that he could not make any agreement, because we were not able to assent to any of the views that were propounded to us beyond any of the alterations in the Bill which have been stated to the House to-night and are of no importance.<lb/>
I say that we made no terms. But it is suggested that we came to an understanding. My Lords, there is no understanding. It was suggested by the noble Marquess that he will be curious to see
<col>814</col>
the next Budget. So will I. But he suggested or seemed to apprehend that there is an understanding about the next Budget. Is there a word in the English language fainter than "understanding" which will give some conception of even less tenuity that will enable me to contradict the suggestion more emphatically? If so I will use it. There is no person in the United Kingdom of whom I know who is tied by any understanding as to the next Budget. If he is I do not know of it, and I am sure that my colleagues will say the same. There is nothing of the kind. Is it not conceivable that this Budget, which is after all a Budget greatly favourable in parts to Ireland, and in my belief also to Great Britain, may possibly have succeeded on its own merits? Such a feat of imagination is scarcely to be attempted by noble Lords; but it is a fact, as far as I know, that no agreement or understanding has been arrived at. No agreement or understanding was needed.<lb/>
There was a public declaration made by the Prime Minister which promised certain action in regard to the Veto. I wish to say this about it. What the Prime Minister said, as he stated, was deliberated upon and agreed to in the Cabinet. I would not have said that if the Prime Minister himself had not stated it in the House of Commons. He was expressing the deliberate policy and opinion of the Government. The statement was not extorted by the pressure of any one or by pressure of any kind. It is the complement and fulfilment of statements which have been made repeatedly by myself, by my noble friend the Leader of this House, by the Prime Minister, and by others, that we will not live as a Government in chains and under the bondage of the Conservative majority in this House. We will not continue as a Government in chains. Either we will be free in the sense that we are out of office, or as a Government we will be free in the sense that we will have power if we have responsibility.<lb/>
Our purpose at present is to procure as well as we can, but as resolutely as men ever set their hands to anything, to procure a state of freedom in one condition or the other; and if any noble Lord thinks that we are anxious to protract a few lingering months of Government, I can assure him that if he knew the mental condition of at least some members of the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0433"/>
<col>815</col>
Government he would not make such an accusation. The truth is that after four or five years in office&#x2014;and here I think we may agree&#x2014;there are very few Ministers who would not be very well pleased to have a holiday as far as their personal feelings are concerned. This policy, as I have stated, was announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons at the commencement of the session; but he could not say anything further until he had the policy framed and accepted by the House of Commons. It was, and then he made the declaration on behalf of the Government.<lb/>
Now this Bill is at last through its long journey, and although little has been said on this occasion, I think it is a great occasion because this Bill is twice memorable and will be so in history&#x2014;memorable because it was the spark from which was kindled and leapt into flame the fiercest controversy known in the annals of this country between the two Houses of Parliament, a controversy which is now steadily marching towards its inevitable settlement. I hope that it will be memorable for another reason than as being the occasion of a quarrel. I believe that it is the first effort on a large scale to provide means by which we may remedy the social evils which prevail amongst the most miserable of our population. I hope your Lordships will believe&#x2014;at all events hope you will try to believe&#x2014;that the men who have framed this Budget will endeavour to administer it in a spirit of honesty and justice.</membercontribution></p>

on the Monday considering Lord Rosebery's Resolutions, and then we have no assurance that any further business is to be proceeded with. I confess I have the sinister suspicion that the noble Earl opposite intends in defiance of the Nonconformist conscience to go to the Derby. Putting the Derby before the Veto would be regarded by some people as worse than putting the Budget before the Veto.

<title>ADDRESSES OF CONDOLENCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01793"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the honour to move, "That a humble Address be presented to His Majesty to assure His Majesty of the heartfelt sympathy of this House in his grievous affliction and loss by the death of the late King, His Majesty's Father, of blessed and glorious memory. That we shall ever remember with grateful affection the zeal and success with which our late Sovereign laboured to consolidate the peace and concord of the world, to aid every merciful endeavour for the alleviation of human suffering, and to unite in justice and freedom all races and classes of his subjects with His Imperial Throne."<lb/>
My Lords, the House re-assembles to-day in the shadow of a great calamity, all the more overwhelming from the suddenness of its approach; for although the conditions of human life forbade the expectation that our late Sovereign could reign for so long a term as did several of his illustrious line, yet his robust constitution, his active way of life, and his abundant vitality all entitled us to hope that the span of his life might equal that of any of his predecessors on the Throne.<lb/>
We look back at these last nine years with feelings of thankfulness and of pride. I think we all recognised at the time of the late King's Accession that the task before His Majesty was one of exceptional difficulty. He succeeded at a comparatively advanced age to the great Queen who had become in her lifetime almost a legendary figure, and whose person seemed to be, as it were, part of the British Constitution itself. Whatever King Edward's reign might be, it could not be the same as that of Queen Victoria; and now as we cast our thoughts backwards we are able sincerely to declare that, though different, the late reign does not suffer by comparison. The prosperity and orderly progress of the nation, the strengthening of Imperial tics, and, above all, the maintenance of peace&#x2014;if these be the signs and tests of a great and glorious reign, they are fulfilled in that of which we are now lamenting the close.<lb/>
My Lords, we all know the capacity, the diligence, the sense of duty with which the late King performed his part as Constitu-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0438"/>
<col>825</col>
tional Sovereign of those realms. Not less aware are we of his conspicuous position in international politics. That position, indeed, has sometimes been misunderstood and misinterpreted both here and abroad. British Sovereigns do not engage in the direct negotiations and transactions of diplomacy; but His Majesty's influence was none the less real and potent. His close knowledge of the continent of Europe, his freedom from insular prejudice, his absolute straightforwardness&#x2014;these, added to his position as an elder and beloved relative in so many Sovereign and Princely Houses, all gave him frequent opportunities which he used, needless to say, always for the benefit of this country, but never to the detriment of any other country, and with a perpetual and engrossing desire for the preservation of peace.<lb/>
I think that we are all profoundly touched by the evident sincerity which has inspired the manifestations of sorrow throughout Europe. On His Majesty's subjects all over the world the loss falls with a different weight. From the Dominions over seas, from the Colonies and from India, there is but one voice of mourning. In the whole of the United Kingdom, over which His Majesty ruled with an equal affection, it is the same. Other Sovereigns may have been popular, but I do not think that any Sovereign has ever been the personal friend of his people in the sense in which King Edward was. Certainly no British Sovereign has ever known and conversed with in the course of his life so many different classes of his subjects and so many individuals in those classes. This was both the origin and the outcome of the keen interest in social questions which so distinguished His Majesty. The result was that he always understood, if he did not always adopt, the point of view of any particular section of his people; that he was sensible to public opinion without being in any degree afraid of it; while those who have been privileged to serve him have been often indebted to his shrewd judgment and the fruit of his large experience.<lb/>
As we all know, the King came in contact with the nation at many other points. His devotion both to his Navy and his Army is well known. His encouragement of science and art, his interest in agriculture, his enjoyment of our national open-air sports and amusements&#x2014;these are familiar to us all.
<col>826</col>
When, too, we consider that there never was seen such unaffected dignity of bearing united to a cordiality so spontaneous and so irresistible, can we be surprised that the country feels that it has lost not only its Sovereign, but its best friend? My Lords, when a great figure such as that of the King passes off this earthly stage we are, indeed, apt first to think of the splendour which surrounds his name, and of the high affairs <i>quorum pars magna fuit</i>. But many will turn to the touches of personal character, the little nameless unremembered acts of kindness, unremembered, indeed, by their doer, but not forgotten by those for whom they were done. Those who in different degrees were honoured by personal intimacy with the King can recall a hundred instances of these kindnesses, and they never, too, will forget his dislike of affectation in every form, his qualities of courage, of generosity in thought and deed, and of toleration which only recoiled from anything that was hard or anything that was insincere.<lb/>
My Lords, I have further to move, "That an Address of Condolence be sent to Her Majesty the Queen-Mother to assure Her Majesty of the deep and warm sympathy which this House feels for Her Majesty in this melancholy time of sorrow and of irreparable loss, and that this House and the Nation will ever preserve towards Her Majesty sentiments of unalterable reverence and affection." Ever since Queen Alexandra came to these shores, forty-seven years ago, she has held a secure place in the hearts of the people of Great Britain. This is not the time to enumerate the qualities which have won for Her Majesty these feelings of affection in an ever-increasing degree. I will only say that if anything could have endeared her more closely to us, it would be the very moving and beautiful Message which we have all read to-day, and none, I am sure, without profound emotion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ADDRESS TO THE KING.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01794">My Lords (continued the noble Earl), I have next to move: "To offer His Majesty our loyal congratulations upon his auspicious Accession, to assure His Majesty of our devotion to His Royal person, and of our sure conviction that his Reign will, under the favour of Divine Providence, be distinguished by unswerving efforts to promote the virtue, prosperity, and contentment of the Realm, and to guard the rights and liberties of His Majesty's faithful
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0439"/>
<col>827</col>
people." With one heart, we all wish His Majesty well. He is well known to many of us. We know that he was brought up plainly and simply in an ideal English home. He has enjoyed what by common consent, I think, we all regard as the best early education and training that a man can have in the British Navy. His Majesty has also enjoyed the advantage of knowing more of his wide Dominions, not merely than any Sovereign who has gone before him, but, perhaps, more even than any one of his own subjects. He has enjoyed, too, the benefit, the incalculable benefit, of continued and close association with his illustrious father, and I do not think that the paternal and filial relation has ever been more happily exemplified than in the case of his late Majesty and the present King. By his side he has in his Gracious Consort one who we know will help him to bear the glorious burden of the British Monarchy. It is our earnest prayer that His Majesty's reign may be long and prosperous and that it may in no way fall short of the two illustrious reigns that have gone before it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01795"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to second the Motion which has been made by the noble Earl opposite. To-night we are all ready to follow him, and, indeed, I think the House owes him a debt for the manner in which he has expressed the many feelings which rush to our minds on this melancholy occasion. It was no easy task for the noble Earl to clothe, as he has done, in appropriate and fitting words, the feelings of profound dismay which this great calamity has occasioned to us; our feelings of sympathy with those who are mourning not only a great public misfortune, but a poignant domestic calamity; and, again, those feelings of hopefulness and of confidence with which we look forward to the reign which has just begun.<lb/>
My Lords, a great misfortune has indeed befallen the British nation, the whole British Empire, and the whole civilised community of the world. The nation mourns a Sovereign to whom it was bound by ties, not only hereditary, but personal&#x2014;ties which the noble Earl has described better than I can attempt to describe them&#x2014;and if we can at such a moment as this find any grain of comfort, it is indeed satisfactory to think that the nation is absolutely unanimous at the present time. We know at this moment no distinction of party, of race, of religious
<col>828</col>
persuasion. We all stand shoulder to shoulder in our desire to express, however imperfectly, our grief and consternation at the common misfortune which has come upon us. The Empire has lost an illustrious chief&#x2014;that vast Empire throughout the length and breadth of which the late King was regarded by all his subjects with an affection not less than that which he commanded within these islands. To those subjects His Majesty stood as the outward symbol of Imperial unity, and I doubt whether any but those who have had the honour of serving the Crown in different parts of the Empire really know to what extent throughout that Empire the feeling of reverence for the Sovereign and the Royal House prevails.<lb/>
But, my Lords, it is not only within the Empire that the King's death has occasioned an irreparable loss. I am sure your Lordships must have listened with approbation to the sketch which the noble Earl gave us of the part played by His late Majesty in connection with the foreign affairs of this country. His Majesty had established with the chiefs of other States and with the public men of other States relations which enabled him to bear, unostentatiously and strictly within the limits of the Constitution, a distinguished and useful part in international affairs, and, to my mind, amongst the many remarkable attributes of the late King none was more remarkable than his power of creating what I can only describe as an atmosphere of international goodwill and good feeling&#x2014;an atmosphere the presence of which diminished asperities, if asperities were there, made difficulties easier of solution, if there were difficulties, and contributed immensely, if I may use the words of the Address, to the consolidation of peace and concord throughout the world. At this moment I am convinced that there is not a <i>Chancellerie</i> in Europe which does not recognise that with the death of King Edward VII a great international force has been removed. It was a force winch always operated for avowable reasons for the public good, and I think we are justified in believing that it will not cease entirely to operate now that he has left us.<lb/>
My Lords, this is no time for elaborate appreciations of the characteristic qualities which enabled His late Majesty to earn for himself the great position which he occupied both in and out of this country. Some of us who are present here to-night had the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0440"/>
<col>829</col>
privilege of hearing the speech which he addressed to the Privy Council at the opening of his reign. Your Lordships may recollect that that speech contained a threefold pledge&#x2014;the pledge that His Majesty would walk in the footsteps of his late mother, the pledge that he desired to be a constitutional Sovereign in the strictest acceptation of the word, and, lastly, the pledge that so long as breath remained in his body, so long would he work for the good of his people. How completely and how nobly has that threefold pledge been redeemed! And, my Lords, does not the pathos of that third pledge come home to us at this moment as we read the accounts of his Majesty's last hours, when the vital spark was already beginning to burn feebly but when the resolve to work for the good of his people burned on undiminished till the end came.<lb/>
His Majesty's position at home and abroad was certainly not due to any studied endeavour to force himself into a position of prominence either upon the national or upon the international stage. It was not due to any deliberate pursuit of popularity for the sake of popularity, but to his spontaneous, instinctive, I would almost say irrepressible kindliness, and to the tact and good temper which were a second nature with him and which never forsook him throughout his life. It was the possession of these qualities which enabled him to feel as his people felt, to share our emotions, our joys, and our sorrows, to take part in our aspirations and hopes, to rejoice with us in our achievements, if anything was achieved and well done; it was the possession of these qualities which led the people of this country to regard His late Majesty, not only as a ruler, but as a friend, and to reverence in him, not only the Sovereign, but the man.<lb/>
The late King never spared himself. Few probably know how heavy was the burden which he had to bear. Nor should we forget that that burden was borne, not only during the nine years, all too short, in which he occupied the Throne, but before his accession and during the latter years of the reign of his illustrious mother, when it was her pleasure to delegate to the then Prince of Wales many of the duties and obligations which naturally pertain to the Sovereign. In this House many of us will no doubt call to mind the fact that in those days His Majesty sat not infrequently on those benches [the Cross Benches] and took an
<col>830</col>
interest and sometimes a part in the business of the House.<lb/>
My Lords, in out public grief we cannot allow ourselves to forget the great private sorrow of those members of the Royal House who are at this moment mourning for the late King, and most of all, surely, our thoughts go out to that illustrious lady who, from the day when we first welcomed her to these shores, nearly half a century ago, has ever stood in the eyes of the people of this country as the embodiment of all that is most graceful and tender, gentle and sympathetic in a woman. We can scarcely bear to think of the Queen-Mother in her desolation. I, at any rate, am quite unequal to the attempt of expressing to the House the feelings which every member of it must entertain towards her at this moment. This, perhaps, we may be permitted to say&#x2014;that the Royal mourners will receive no truer and more heartfelt expressions of sympathy than those which this House is ready to tender to them.<lb/>
And now it remains for me merely to add one word to what has fallen from the noble Earl in regard to our feelings towards the Sovereign who has assumed his father's place. We offer him the full measure of our allegiance and devotion. King George the Fifth is not a stranger to us. He has already shown his aptitude for the great task which lies before him. Already we recognise in the son the presence of many of the qualities which served to endear the father. In the midst of our sorrow, we can look forward with confidence to the future. The reign which has closed has been honourable and happy for the nation and for the Throne. The reign which is now opening will, we believe, under Providence furnish a chapter not less creditable to the history of this country and not less honourable to the annals of the Royal House. I beg to second.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.&#x2014;THE REFORM<lb/> RESOLUTIONS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01845"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to ask the noble Earl who leads the House whether he can give your Lordships any information as to the course of business during the next week or two.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01846"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will recollect that, as arrangements were before the deplorable event which has so affected us all, my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery) had put down his Resolutions for the first day of our reassembling. Now I understand that be has so far taken them off the Paper as to place them in the list of Motions which are put down without any date named, and I understand that he does not propose to bring them forward for a short time. The House will also remember that we had arranged that we should not take the Government Resolutions until after those of my noble friend had been discussed. We have no desire to depart from that arrangement, and therefore we do not propose to deal in any way with our Resolutions until those of my noble friend have been brought forward. I do not know whether my noble friend has anything to say on the matter, but in any case it will probably be for the convenience of the House if the whole question as regards the discussion of this particular matter stands over for a week or two, when perhaps we shall be in a better position to speak more definitely. As regards other business, your Lordships have the Paper at your disposal, and I think you will see that there is not a great deal of business before us at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01847"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what my noble friend has said is quite true, that my Motion has passed into the category of those for which no day is
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0444"/>
<col>837</col>
named. That is partly in its origin due to a misunderstanding on my part. I thought the Resolutions were put down for the first day after the recess, and that that day would automatically pass from May 26 to June 8, but in any case it was not my intention to proceed with them to-day. I had, I admit, been very anxious to do so, but I have received intimations from influential quarters that, in the opinion of those who are well qualified to judge, it is better that I should not proceed on the first day of our reassembling. There was, I think, in the minds of those who so spoke an idea that the opportunity might be taken of the recent bereavement of the nation for some form of pacification as between the acute demands of the two Parties on this great constitutional issue. There Was also a feeling, I think, that it was not desirable to embarrass the beginning of a new reign and the personality of a new King by pushing forward issues affecting the Constitution so grave as those which we have been discussing this year. Of course that, in my judgment, does not apply to my Resolutions. They are a matter, at this stage at any rate, for the House itself. They are the principles which the House of Lords desires, as I hope, to lay down with reference to some future plan of reform to be carried out by some future Executive Government. But they have not passed beyond that stage, and indeed they have not arrived at the stage at which they exist at all as Resolutions of this House. But it was said, and perhaps truly, that if I were to press on these Resolutions I should seem to invite reprisals&#x2014;though, as I have already pointed
<col>838</col>
out, this is not a matter of reprisals; that I should at any rate possibly act as a provocation to those who are not unwilling to be provoked; and that it would be said that my action, or rather our action&#x2014;for it is not my action, but the action of this House&#x2014;would be taken as raising the question afresh at a time when there was a general desire for peace. Nothing, in my judgment, could be more unfounded in logic than any such pretence of provocation in proceeding with our Resolutions. This is not a new matter for us. To those who desire the reform of the House of Lords the question has not arisen since the rejection of the Finance Bill of last year. For six-and-twenty years some of us have been working to try to bring this matter to a favourable issue, and therefore I venture to say that, except as offering a favourable opportunity for carrying forward our reforms, our Resolutions have nothing to do with the Veto Resolutions of the Government. Therefore, when I say I shall not proceed with them to-day, or perhaps to-morrow, or immediately, I have no intention of deferring them as being in relation to the Resolutions of the Government. Our Resolutions stand apart and on their own foundation, and though I will not willingly, directly or indirectly, do anything to provoke a spirit of animosity or to prevent a spirit of pacification, I must say that as regards our Resolutions they must remain within our own control.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE MEDITERRANEAN COMMAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01895"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> rose to call attention to the position of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and High Commissioner in the Mediterranean; to ask His Majesty's Government whether it is intended to continue the appointment; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01896">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I have been informed that within the last few minutes an answer has been given by the Secretary of State for War in another place which deals partially with the subject which I desire to submit to your Lordships' consideration. I understand that it has been stated that the appointment of High Commissioner in the Mediterranean, which it was announced nearly a year ago had been accepted by Lord Kitchener, is not now to be held by that distinguished officer, and that, although another officer will be appointed, the same title will not be given to the position. This announcement, though I am sure it will have been heard by your Lordships with regret in view of the great services of Lord Kitchener, by no means absolves me from the task of bringing before your Lordships the state of facts with regard to this appointment with the object of eliciting from the Government what their intention may be as regards the future, and, if possible, of placing before this House considerations which would make it impossible for the Government to renew an appointment which I believe to be in peace useless and in war a national danger.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01897">The circumstances of the Mediterranean from a military standpoint are probably well known to all present, and I need not recapitulate them. Three years ago there were Governors of Gibraltar and Malta, men of high military rank, who were at the head of the Colonial Governments and the military establishment. We had in Egypt the Consul-General; we also had the commander of the British troops, who was responsible to the War Office, and the Sirdar, who was in close touch with the Consul-General, but who, being the Khedive's officer, commanded the native troops who were not under a British General. These arrangements, although in the case of Egypt they undoubtedly were arrangements of much delicacy, requiring great tact and judgment on the part of the officers concerned, I think I may say worked upon the whole smoothly and
<col>844</col>
without friction for a long period of years, and, owing to the excellent cable communication and the fact that nearly every year the high officials at Malta, Gibraltar, and in Egypt were in touch with this country and came here in the summer, there had really been no difficulty in adapting those arrangements to modern requirements.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01898">But three years ago His Majesty's Government suddenly, and without giving any very specific reason, established a High Commissioner. The title is a very high-sounding one, but I confess that when one comes to look at the powers entrusted to that officer those powers fall ludicrously short of the title. I hope, my Lords, I may trespass on your indulgence for a moment to refer to these powers. I believe they have never been given to us as a Parliamentary Paper, but, as far as I have been able to trace them, they are contained in an answer given by Mr. Haldane on August 8, 1907, in which we were told that His Majesty's Government had decided to create a new Command in the Mediterranean, with headquarters at Malta. Then we were told that the force under His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, who had been appointed to the Command, would comprise the garrisons of Gibraltar and Malta and so forth, and that all matters of local military administration Would continue to be disposed of by the Governors of Gibraltar and Malta. The only portions of a long answer which refer to His Royal Highness are these&#x2014;
<quote>"His Royal Highness will be able to devote his attention to inspection and training, and to the consideration of questions of strategy and defence within the limits of his command."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01899">Further on the Secretary of State for War said&#x2014;
<quote>"In regard to questions of policy which involve military considerations the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief and High Commissioner will be consulted by the representatives of the Foreign and Colonial Offices before they lay their views on such questions before their respective Departments."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01900">Well, my Lords, that is not a very wide sphere of activity. I believe it will be felt by all who have had experience of military affairs that if you could isolate the Mediterranean and treat it as a place with four or five stations having little communication with home and a good deal with each other, and if you could, looking back to the Napoleonic days, imagine that communication with this country was sparse and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0448"/>
<col>845</col>
opportunities of exchange of opinion, and still more of the giving of orders on active service, were very difficult from headquarters, then, I think, it might be wise to place the Mediterranean and all its forces under one supreme head, to whom all could apply for the support which they might require in any emergency. But, my Lords, if you are to do that you must put the Navy as well as the Army under the High Commissioner. What is the use of putting a man to sit down at Malta when he cannot move a single ship or a single regiment without orders from home? If you are to treat the High Commissioner in the manner that I have suggested you would have to put him in the same position as the Governor-General of India in regard to the troops and the ships under his control in his Command. He moves them where he pleases. He accounts to one Secretary of State alone. But if you do not give those powers you really run the risk of duplicating duties and of complicating the whole machinery of action in case of emergency.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01901">Now what was the position of the Duke of Connaught as High Commissioner? It is most important that we should look into this question in view of Mr. Haldane's answer this evening, because we are told, as I understand, that the new arrangements proposed on the change in the High Commissionership have fallen to the ground, and a fresh set of arrangements for a fresh official, who is to have fresh duties and fresh powers, is to be set on foot. I ask your Lordships to consider what those duties and powers can reasonably be. In the first place, I deprecate putting any man in the position in which the late High Commissioner was placed&#x2014;a position in which he was responsible to three Departments and connected in his action with certainly one, if not two, more. The orders to the Duke of Connaught, if framed on the answer of the Secretary of State, meant that he was responsible on certain points to the Foreign Office, on others to the Colonial Office, on others to the War Office, and he was to act also in connection with the Admiralty. I do not believe that in the varied experience of all the high officials who are now sitting in your Lordships' House there is any man who has gone through such a penance as being responsible to four different Government Departments in Whitehall. Although he was nominally in charge and nominally
<col>846</col>
representing the Crown, so ridiculous was that position that even in that respect I have understood that the High Commissioner when present represented the Sovereign and the Governor of Malta claimed to represent the Sovereign when the High Commissioner was absent; and that, by a sort of Box and Cox arrangement, when the High Commissioner was present "God Save the King" was played in his honour, and when he was absent it was played for the Governor of Malta-These are small <i>nuances</i>, but they might conceivably lead to friction. The important point was whether the High Commissioner could co-ordinate all the forces in the Mediterranean if desired. He could not do anything which could not be done equally by the noble and gallant Field Marshal Lord Grenfell when he was Governor of Malta. He could not move a regiment from Gibraltar to Malta without consent and orders from the War Office. He could not move a gunboat from Malta to Cyprus, Crete, or Egypt without orders from the War Office&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01902"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: From the Admiralty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01903"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Without orders from the Admiralty, as the ex-First Lord, whom we are glad to welcome amongst us again, reminds me. He could not move a regiment from Cairo to Khartum without first consulting the Consul-General in Egypt and then obtaining orders from the War Office. If it were desirable I might pursue these regulations&#x2014;the regulations I read out a moment ago&#x2014;which prescribed that on all diplomatic questions which had a military importance His Royal Highness should be consulted by the Foreign and Colonial representatives before they made recommendations to their respective Departments. If such correspondence exists I shall be very interested to see it laid on this Table. I think it is extremely probable that that which I would venture to describe as a piece of padding in the Secretary's answer had some insignificance when it came to action.<lb/>
Your Lordships will see that the result of all that is this, that the late High Commissioner had absolutely no work to do there at all except to inspect the troops within his Command. What were those troops? In 1904 there were scattered between Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Crete,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0449"/>
<col>847</col>
Egypt, and the Sudan under 22,500 British troops. Those troops have since been very considerably decreased. I am not founding any charge upon that, but as a matter of fact they have been reduced by about 5,000 men. The whole number in the Mediterranean, including Egypt and the regiment at Khartum, is now about 17,000 or less, and for inspectional purposes I cannot help remarking that those 17,000 troops have already got the advantage of being commanded by nine Generals. I have some doubt whether it is economically sound to add a Field-Marshal, with a Major-General on his Staff, solely for the inspection of these 17,000 troops who have already got such ample oversight.<lb/>
Although I do not wish to introduce any side issues, I should like to make two or three remarks on this subject. In the first place, I hope it will not be inferred that we on this side view with equanimity the present size and strength of the force in the Mediterranean, and notably in Egypt. I trust that the strength in Egypt will meet with the attention of His Majesty's Government. I hope also, what I am sure by those who have served in Egypt wall be regarded as important, that if there is to be another officer in any way in control in Egypt it will be remembered that the present system under which one Brigadier-General, or Major-General paid as a Brigadier, commands the troops in Egypt is one which is not only inadequate but calculated very greatly to detract from the proper position of the General Officer commanding there. Of course, if it is argued that he is the <i>locum tenens</i> of the General Officer at Malta, some case would appear to be made out for the reduction. But to ask a man in one of the most expensive towns in the world to live in a house which requires at least &#x00A3;3,000 or &#x00A3;4,000 a year to keep up, to maintain the proper position of a General Officer commanding the British troops in a country which is held by British troops, and to give him about &#x00A3;1,000 a year to do it, does seem to me to be a most unwise condition of things, and the sooner we return to a position in which that officer is appointed because he is the very best man for the post and well worth paying to do a very difficult business, I think the better. I am not saying a word in derogation of the Commanding Officer in Egypt. I should like to see his <i>status</i> raised to an equality with his ability and his responsibility.<lb/>
<col>848</col>
Another thing I ask is that in whatever appointment they make His Majesty's Government will have some regard to finance and economy. I know that when first the High Commissionership was set on foot the Secretary of State for War told a pleased House of Commons that no expense would be incurred by this additional post. We can all do a sum in subtraction. If you had 22,500 troops and you have now got only 17,000 you probably want fewer Generals and not more. I would point out again&#x2014;it is a figure which I know has been one of embarrassment to the noble Lord the Under-Secretary&#x2014;that in the incredibly short space of between four and five years the present Government, who took up Army Estimates of a little over &#x00A3;28,000,000 with the determination to immensely reduce them, have managed to reduce them by about &#x00A3;1,000,000 in all, but of the savings gained by reducing troops &#x00A3;500,000 a year goes in the payment of Staff Officers who did not exist before. I press that because the efforts of Government after Government have been brought to bear to decrease, if possible, the great expenditure on Staff, and if Staff is wanted for the many new purposes which this Government have set on foot, then I would ask that, where we cannot avoid making fresh and expensive appointments of this character, we should exercise all the economy we can. We know also on the Civil side, from a Paper which was placed before your Lordships a few days ago, that as a result of the legislation of this Government 1,200 new posts have already been created in the Civil Service, involving an expenditure already of &#x00A3;135,000 a year.<lb/>
I think the point we come to at the close of the Duke of Connaught's <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> is that, so far as the command of troops went, the High Commissioner found himself the fifth wheel of the coach; and, so far as the inspection of troops went, it seemed an inadequate use of military strength, and perhaps an inadequate recompense for past military service, to have asked the Duke of Connaught, who had been Inspector-General of the Forces at home, inspecting 200,000 men, to devote his whole time, to eke out his time as best he could, in inspecting and re-inspecting a body of troops who, in all, only make up two weak brigades and did not make up more than a Lieut-General's command. I do not think any of your Lordships will have been surprised that,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0450"/>
<col>849</col>
in these circumstances, the Duke of Connaught felt that he could not continue in the appointment with advantage to the public or in the satisfactory performance of his own duties.<lb/>
We enter then on the second chapter of this rather remarkable story. On August 7 last year we were informed by an official <i>communiqu&#x00E9;</i> of Lord Kitchener's acceptance of the appointment, and the wording of that acceptance is so remarkable that I would ask your Lordships' special attention to it. It ran&#x2014;
<quote>"We are officially informed that Lord Kitchener, in conformity with the wishes of the Government, has accepted the position of High Commissioner and Field-Marshal Commanding-iii-Chief in the Mediterranean. He will have a seat on the Committee of Imperial Defence. In view of new developments in organisation, the Mediterranean Command assumes increased importance, and it will be taken up by Lord Kitchener with the object of giving it its proper place in the great scheme of Imperial Defence."</quote>
Why the words "in conformity with the wishes of the Government"? Has anybody ever seen those words before in notifying to the Press a high appointment under the Government? Does not every high official accept his position in conformity with the wishes of the Government? We saw an announcement on Saturday of the greatest interest. I am sure your Lordships will have seen with great satisfaction that a most distinguished diplomatist has accepted the office of Viceroy of India in succession to Lord Minto. But we are not told that that was done in conformity with the wishes of the Government. We are left to assume that, though he gives up one post where he will be very much missed to take up another and a higher post, he has done so in conformity with the wishes of the Government. Without labouring the expression, one cannot help being driven by the announcement made to-day in another place to the understanding that this appointment was accepted by Lord Kitchener in conformity with the wishes of the Government but against his own wishes and against his own judgment. And I am sure that if your Lordships will follow the successive statements made as to his duties, their heterogeneous character, and the manner in which they are all jumbled together regardless of time, place, circumstance, or the powers of the human frame, you will have no wonder that Lord Kitchener should have hesitated and finally refused to assume them.<lb/>
<col>850</col>
We were told that Lord Kitchener was to have a seat on the Committee of Imperial Defence. That Committee used to sit, and sits still I believe, weekly for many months in the year. It hears not merely written papers but oral evidence and discussion. It would be impossible for Lord Kitchener to have attended that Committee without being for many months in the year absent from his Command. It would be possible for him to have attended for many months and yet not to have been a party to, and not to have heard, some of the most important decisions at which that Committee might have arrived. I will leave the subject merely with this observation, that that Committee's work is not final. Their business is to advise and not to decide. The final voice lies with the Cabinet. But I think nothing can be more fatal to the interests of that Committee than, on the one hand, that men without official responsibility and who cannot be held accountable should be the advisers, and, on the other, that officers of high military or naval rank should be cited in support of conclusions which they have not had the opportunity of recording their opinions upon. That must have been the position of Lord Kitchener with regard to a large number of the conclusions of that Committee if, in the case of his Command, he had been invited to take his seat on the Committee of Imperial Defence.<lb/>
A few days later Mr. Haldane made a further announcement. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The inspection of the Regular Forces throughout Africa and the giving of military advice to the local authorities were to be part of the duties of the Mediterranean Command."</quote>
I have had the curiosity to look up what this really involves. It struck me, in the first instance, that the Mediterranean Command already involved a good deal of travelling. But here is a list of the stations which Lord Kitchener, engaged for some months in the year on the Defence Committee in London, was to inspect. He was to inspect Gibraltar, Cyprus, Egypt and the Sudan; he was to inspect British, South Africa, Nyassaland, Somaliland, and Uganda; Natal, the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, and the Cape Colony; Mauritius, Gambia, the Gold Coast, Northern Nigeria, Southern Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. I said just now that the title "High Commissioner in the Mediterranean" is a high-sounding one, but this officer was to be High Commissioner not
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0451"/>
<col>851</col>
only in the Mediterranean, but also in the Indian Ocean and in the South Atlantic, and instead of having his headquarters at Malta, he should have been accommodated with headquarters at Lake Chad. There seems to be confusion of thought in imagining that any man could have taken the part assigned to this distinguished Commander. But while we were feeling that a man who had already such wide oppotunities of travel and adventure was probably sufficiently seized of work in the interests of the Empire, the Secretary of State for War came down with a further bombshell. On September 15 last he announced that Lord Kitchener would be the President of the Selection Board, which meets monthly in London. Your Lordships are probably aware that on the decisions of the Selection Board depends the career of practically every officer in the Army. A man at a single meeting of the Selection Board is passed over or has his appointment decided against him and his career may be regarded as closed. I submit&#x2014;and I say this with confidence that I shall be supported by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts&#x2014;that there is no work done by the high officials of the War Office which demands such great care and attention; and I do think it is an extraordinary arrangement to ask an already overburdened officer to take the Presidency of that Board when he was bound to be absent for many months together on his other duties, and to exclude from it the late President His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, who had the absolute confidence of the Army, who had leisure and was in London, and who could perform the detailed duties which it was impossible for Lord Kitchener to find time to discharge. I do not wish to labour that point, but it does seem to me one of the most extraordinary questions that have arisen in the course of this controversy.<lb/>
The conclusion to which I invite your Lordships to come is that, although it may be a matter of serious importance to relieve the Inspector-General of the Forces of the inspection of troops in Africa, although it may be well to appoint a man for that special task provided that he is not asked to interfere in the rather delicate arrangements of Egypt, there are grave doubts whether it is desirable that the time of a prominent Field-Marshal should be spent in going into all these smaller garrisons and absenting himself from headquarters to the degree proposed in the
<col>852</col>
Paper I cited a moment ago. I think it would be generally agreed that if it were possible to combine all this inspection work at headquarters and if it were necessary to unite it in a single individual, then that individual must have his headquarters in London and not in Malta. I think that some idea of that kind must have occurred to the Government themselves. Looking back at the notices of the appointment I endeavoured to detect, both in the language of the Secretary of State and in the language of those who justified it, some explanation of Malta having been seized upon as the headquarters. As regards the Secretary of State, he only said that&#x2014;
<quote>"It is desirable that the problem of military defence, as a whole should he studied on the spot by officers of high standing and long experience who have time at their disposal fully to consider the questions involved."</quote>
But the panegyrists of the Government went further, and pointed out that for one who had done much work in the East Malta was the place to rest. And a special panegyrist proceeded to say that&#x2014;
<quote>"To an expert horticulturist like Lord Kitchener the gardens of the Palace of Valetta cannot fail to present an attraction."</quote>
This is the only justification attempted for localising an official at Malta whose duties were to lie almost exclusively elsewhere. In all the long list of duties that I have detailed to you there is no increase of power given to the new High Commissioner as compared to the old. He can report and inspect, but he cannot move a ship and he cannot move a man. I am all for trusting the man on the spot, but he must be on the spot, and not on so many spots as he is supposed to be in this case. Most of the orders which he gave could be given with greater effect, because they would be given with greater consultation with the authorities at home, by the Chief of the General Staff sitting in London. It amounts to this, that if you are going, as I hope the Government are not, to resuscitate this Command in respect of the Mediterranean at all, you are going back to the days when the Command could be justified, as in the time of Nelson, by the absence of cable communication; but an appointment which was useful and desirable in the days of Nelson really becomes grotesque in the circumstances which I have stated to your Lordships. If the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, call him by what name you like, is to have no greater powers of moving troops and controlling the whole force than were
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0452"/>
<col>853</col>
possessed by the Duke of Connaught or were proposed to be possessed by Lord Kitchener, I think that Malta should be left entirely out of consideration, and that an inspector for South Africa should be appointed. I do not think you have the right to put on any distinguished officer responsibility when you do not give him power; and if you are going to give the necessary powers I submit that it is impossible for any General Officer, however considerate and however careful, to avoid coming into sharp collision with the Governor of Malta, with the Consul-General in Egypt, and with the Admiral commanding on the Mediterranean Station, and every one will admit that it is highly desirable that all those contingencies should be avoided.<lb/>
This appointment and the object of it leave us in perplexity. I personally am still tossing on the sea of doubt as to what can have induced the Government to change past conditions as they have done. We are this evening at this point. One eminent Field-Marshal has attempted the post and has vacated it; another eminent Field-Marshal has accepted the post and, apparently after long consideration in conference with the Government, has thrown it up. We have present this evening the late Consul-General in Egypt, than whom no man speaks in this House with greater authority, and we have the noble and gallant Field-Marshal who has commanded in Egypt and has also been Governor of Malta. I shall be surprised if either of those great authorities tells us that there is need for any change in the command of troops in the Mediterranean from that which existed a few years ago. If that be so, surely I have the right to ask the Government on what military authority they have been acting. Can they produce any Memorandum from the Defence Committee or from the Army Council showing the necessity of this supreme command? I think that one thing we want is continuity in military policy. We have got lately a certain continuity in Egypt, and since the days when commissioners used to be sent there on the smallest provocation we have certainly advanced enormously in that country. I submit that to disturb that progress by interpolating a fresh authority between the central authority and the Egyptian authorities is bad policy, and one which we ought to do our best to protest against in this new appointment.<lb/>

It is for that reason that I ask His Majesty's Government to put us fully into possession of their views, and I would urge them to give us such Papers as they can to clear up this important question. I will, in conclusion, move that there be laid before this House any Memorandum of the Defence Committee or the Army Council establishing the necessity of appointing a High Commissioner in the Mediterranean; secondly, any Memorandum defining the duties of the late High Commissioner and the proposed duties of the new High Commissioner; and, thirdly, all correspondence between His Majesty's Government and Field-Marshal H. R. H. the Duke of Connaught, and between His Majesty's Government and Field-Marshal Viscount Kitchener relating to the duties and powers of the High Commissioner. I ask for those Papers in order that when the terms of the fresh appointment which the Government now speak of making are announced the country shall be able to judge whether it can be held with due consideration to the officer who may be appointed to it and with advantage to the Empire.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01905"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to make a very few remarks in support of the observations which have fallen from the noble Viscount. Every one, I am sure, would wish that the great talents and experience of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Viscount Kitchener should be utilised to the best advantage of the nation. But it may well be doubted whether the idea of utilising those services by appointing him to be High Commissioner of the Mediterranean is cither a wise or a happy one. We have, therefore, heard
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0453"/>
<col>855</col>
without surprise, and I may say for my own part without regret, that Lord Kitchener is not to go to the Mediterranean. I hope that some other means will be found for employing that very distinguished officer.<lb/>
In the first place, it appears to me to be a waste of power, and in the second place, I have never yet fully understood or appreciated the reasons which made this appointment necessary at all. If it is made, one of two results must always infallibly ensue. Either the High Commissioner will efface himself and do little or nothing&#x2014;a position which no military officer of high standing should be asked to occupy&#x2014;or, if this is not done, then the High Commissioner, if he begins to interfere, will almost certainly clash with the other political, naval, and military authorities in the Mediterranean. I should wish, moreover, to say that nowhere is friction more likely to occur than in Egypt. The powers it is proposed to confer upon the High Commissioner in respect to Egyptian affairs ought to be defined if the appointment is made, and I think, in practice, a definition will be found extremely difficult.<lb/>
The relations between the officers commanding the British and Egyptian forces in Egypt have always been very delicate, and, like almost everything in that country, anomalous. From time to time they have caused a good deal of trouble, and if the arrangement which was made some few years ago now works fairly well, this is mainly due to the good feeling, tact, and judgment displayed by the officers commanding on either side. I do not say that the present arrangement is theoretically perfect, but it works well in practice. Why not leave it alone? What object is there in appointing a High Commissioner, who will really be the fifth wheel in the coach? There are in all conscience sufficient difficulties at present in Egypt, difficulties which it would be obviously improper for me to dwell upon at this moment, but as to which I will only say that, considerable though they are, they are by no means insuperable if the stern realities of the existing situation are recognised with adequate clearness and determination.<lb/>
The truth is that amongst the many plagues which have from time to time
<col>856</col>
descended upon Egypt, the mania which at one time possessed all concerned to send either Special Commissioners or High Commissioners to that unfortunate country has not been the least. The disease broke out at a very early period of the Egyptian troubles. In 1881, the Turkish Government, with the consent of the British and French Governments, sent a special commission composed of two Pashas, to Egypt. This visitation was of very short duration, for no sooner had they arrived in Cairo than both the British and the French Governments exerted the strongest pressure to make them leave the country, and in a very few days these efforts were crowned with success. Then Lord Granville started a very peculiar, and I do not doubt original, idea. It was that in order to quell a mutinous army two Special Commissioners, one English and one French, who had been in the habit of studying economic questions, should be sent to Cairo. This proposal was at once scouted by Sir Edward Malet and the other authorities on the spot. They thought&#x2014;and I think very rightly&#x2014;that there was no distinct connection between economic science and mutinous armies.<lb/>
The French Government then followed suit with a somewhat similar proposal of their own. They wanted to send two Generals as Special Commissioners to Egypt who were to have no executive authority, but were to advise. Again this proposal was providentially abandoned at the instance of the local authorities, who did not think that it was much use giving advice to a mutinous army which, for various reasons, had been lashed into a state of frenzy. Then followed the Dufferin Mission, which produced some very useful results; Lord Dufferin did admirable work. After that, General Gordon was sent as a Special Commissioner to the Sudan, and we all know the disastrous results which ensued from that Mission. Shortly afterwards Lord Northbrook was sent as a Special Commissioner to Egypt. He made a very useful Report, but inasmuch as his views did not tally with those of the Government of the day, it was put into the waste-paper basket. After that, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff and his Turkish colleague, Moukhtar Pasha, were sent as Special Commissioners to Egypt. They were to settle the whole Egyptian question, but they failed to do so. The only result of this Mission was to leave
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0454"/>
<col>857</col>
behind it a <i>damnosa hereditas</i> in the person of a permanent Turkish Commissioner, whose presence in the country has not been of the smallest use to the Sultan, the Egyptian people, or to anyone else. Their Commission gave birth to another minor Commission which was intended to treat with the Mahdi, the only result attained being that it gave an admirable opportunity to that potentate to hurl a series of curses and anathemas at the heads of both the Sultan and the Queen of England. After that, the era of Special Commissioners and High Commissioners was fortunately closed, and though it may be only a coincidence, it is nevertheless a fact that simultaneously with the blight of Special Commissions being removed, the country began to revive and prosper.<lb/>
I confess that, after the experience that has been gained, I look with some distrust and suspicion at a revival of the idea of sending a High Commissioner to Egypt. What is he to do when he gets to Cairo? Is he merely to report? In that case his appointment is quite unnecessary, for all the reports that may be required can be received from the authorities now on the spot. Is he to inspect? That is a military detail on which I cannot form any opinion, but in that case he ought to be called an Inspector. Or is he to have executive authority? In that case his appointment will be absolutely hurtful, for it is quite impossible that he should do anything without clashing with the other authorities on the spot, and producing confusion in the administration of the country. For these reasons I earnestly hope that after the very slight approval, if not condemnation, with which the proposal to send a Special Commissioner has been met by almost every one who can speak with authority on the subject, the idea will be abandoned. I feel convinced that if it is not abandoned the War Office will not only lay for themselves the seeds of a great deal of further trouble; they will not only waste a certain amount of public money, which might well be economised, but further, they will not attain any national objects sufficient to justify this new and, I think, somewhat unfortunate departure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01906"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GRENFELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount mentioned my name as an ex-Governor of Malta, and having had the
<col>858</col>
experience of command in Egypt and Malta I desire to support the Motion for Papers. I agree with every word which the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, has said, especially his remarks about High Commissioners. I was commanding the Egyptian Army at the time that these various Commissioners appeared. They always desired full information. We were then struggling with great difficulty to create an Army. We were taken away from our work, and it was very embarrassing sometimes to supply all the information required.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has given the numbers and the strength of the forces in the Mediterranean. A large number of those are men who would not necessarily be inspected, such as hospital orderlies and men connected with the transport and other departments&#x2014;not true fighting men. The total number of battalions of Infantry in the Mediterranean at present is twelve. There are two at Gibraltar, five at Malta, four in Egypt, and one at Khartum. It seems perfectly absurd to any soldier that an officer of high rank should be appointed with the sole duty of inspecting and supervising the training of these troops. Who are the officers in command of the Mediterranean stations? At Gibraltar there is Sir F. W. Forestier-Walker, an officer of longer experience than that of Lord Kitchener; at Malta there is Sir Leslie Rundle, whose name is well known in connection with the South African war; and in Egypt there is another very distinguished officer, although he is only a Major-General. If those officers with their many years' service are not capable of inspecting and training the troops under their command the sooner they are dismissed from the Army the better. In addition, there are other officers of the War Office who periodically inspect the Artillery and the Engineers, and the Inspector-General of the Army, I conclude, makes a visit there, as his duty is to inspect the various units abroad. Therefore these unfortunate battalions would be perpetually undergoing a system of inspection. The duties are very hard in Malta and Gibraltar, and out of this small number of troops very few probably would be seen by the inspecting officer.<lb/>
May I say one word as to the position of the unfortunate Governors? In order that the sum necessary for the payment
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0455"/>
<col>859</col>
of the High Commissioner might be produced, the salary of the Governor of Malta was reduced from &#x00A3;5,000 to &#x00A3;3,000 a year. He lost the Palace, which is really in Valetta the only place fit for the Governor, and he also lost the best of the Residences outside the city of Valetta. Two Generals were reduced, and a large number of the Staff; this was done, no doubt, to provide the necessary funds, so as to obviate any extra charge to the public in connection with the High Commissioner's salary.<lb/>
The title, as the noble Viscount said, is a very high-sounding one, but I cannot conceive in what possible way such an appointment as that of High Commissioner can be of the slightest use whatever. On the contrary, fortresses must be self-contained, and I think my noble and gallant friend Lord Roberts will agree that two Kings of Brentford are highly dangerous. I should like to ask the noble Lord the Under-Secretary what will be the exact functions of this High Commissioner in war. Is he to be interned in a fortress, or is he to be placed somewhere where he can communicate with the forces by wireless telegraphy or airship? If he is interned in a fortress he can have very little influence over his command. The very fact that so distinguished an officer as the Duke of Connaught should have found that it was an impossible position might, of itself, have induced the Government entirely to reconsider the question of this appointment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01907"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there have been a number of questions asked in the speeches of the noble Lords who have spoken up to now, and I will do my best to answer them and to give all the information which can be given at the present moment. I am afraid that does not mean that I can answer every question that has been put, but such information as can be given I will lay before your Lordships. I have, to my great regret, to confirm the statement already made by the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, to the effect that Lord Kitchener has now informed the Secretary of State that he does not desire to take up the appointment to the Mediterranean Command. It is, nevertheless, the intention of the Government to keep up the appointment. Ever since the growth of
<col>860</col>
our military organisation created the necessity for the post three years ago the Government have attached high importance to it, and at no time have they rated its importance higher than at the present moment when both recent and prospective developments in our military organisation render it, in their opinion, essential. The actual number of troops in the Mediterranean Command is by no means the only factor in the situation, but the noble Viscount will hardly expect me now to go into a discussion on that point, which is, after all, a question of policy which has been debated in numerous aspects at different times.<lb/>
Our experience during the past three years has shown us that the real value of this appointment lies in its military duties, and we consider that the scope of these can advantageously be enlarged. This particular aspect of the case has for some time past been engaging the close attention of the Government, and though I am not able to give the House full information with regard to all the details, I can give certain definite points which will, I think, show some of the directions in which we propose to develop this post. We do not consider it necessary for the new Commander-in-Chief to reside in the Mediterranean for more than a portion of the year, and this Command will henceforward carry with it the inspection of all the military forces oversea, except in India&#x2014;a duty at present carried out by the Inspector-General, Sir John French.<lb/>
For some time past, especially since the creation of the Special Reserve and the Territorial Force, it has been becoming increasingly evident that the inspection of the troops at home is amply sufficient to occupy the time of the Inspector-General, and important duties have had to be set aside to allow him to carry out his oversea inspections. Therefore we have realised that if the duties of Inspector-General are to be efficiently carried out&#x2014;and we attach very great importance to that&#x2014;it is necessary that we should have one Inspector-General for our forces at home and another Inspector-General for our oversea forces; and this appointment, as we view it now, is going to enable us to have an Inspector-General for the oversea forces.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0456"/>
<col>861</col>
There is another possible development upon which, however, I cannot speak quite so definitely at the present moment. We anticipate so much benefit to the Dominion Forces from the visits of Lord Kitchener to Australia and New Zealand, and of Sir John French to Canada, that if, as a result of the next Colonial Conference, visits to the Dominions for the purpose of inspection and advice on military matters could be made more or less systematically by an officer of high rank and distinguished military service, we believe that they would produce most useful results. If this should be agreed to, the most appropriate officer to carry out this duty would, in our opinion, be the Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces and Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean. Then with regard to the question of the High Commissioner-ship, on which Lord Cromer spoke, we consider that in view of the importance of his inspectional duties generally, and the prolonged absence from the Mediterranean which these duties will often entail, it is inexpedient that the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean should continue to be styled High Commissioner.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01909"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: No. The present conditions and the present responsibility will not be affected by any change we may make in this post. With regard to Papers, I hope the noble Viscount will forgive me for saying that I have listened to a number of speeches of his in this House, and it is his habit to terminate those speeches by asking for information on a number of questions, information a great part of which, were he in office and requests made to him for the same information, he would be the first to refuse. Therefore I am not prepared to agree at once to produce all the Papers for which the noble Viscount asks. I can, however, undertake that we will lay at the earliest possible opportunity the information which we can legitimately give.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01910"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has gone into several matters, but has carefully avoided answering any of those points which were raised by my noble friend behind me. He has said that
<col>862</col>
the only alterations intended to be made are, first of all, that the title of High Commissioner is to be given up. But he has not said that any of the duties which it has been pointed out would be so dangerous, both for efficiency and discipline, are to be given up with the High Commissioner-ship. In addition to that, he has said that the inspection of all Regular troops outside the United Kingdom will be placed in the hands of this new Commander-in-Chief. That sounds a great deal, but as a matter of fact there are no Regular troops except in the numerous posts that have already been mentioned by the noble Viscount. The noble Lord, in his reply, has not dealt with this point, that at such a vital position as the Mediterranean you may have in time of war the man who is responsible not only for the posts in the Mediterranean, but for all the other posts in Africa, interned in a fortress and unable to take any part or to do anything towards the defence of those places for which he is supposed to be responsible. You will have in every single place two men responsible, able to shift the responsibility from one to the other, and in time of war you will have the one man whom you appoint to supervise the whole in all probability unable to take any part or parcel in the defence.<lb/>
The whole question seems to me to be&#x2014;What are the reasons why the Duke of Connaught refused to go on with the post and why Lord Kitchener accepted it and afterwards refused to go on with it? The noble Lord tells us that he will not, that he cannot, give us any Papers. Surely if we are to allow to go on this post which he says must go on for military reasons, we are entitled to know why the two military men who have had practical experience, one actually on the spot, refused to continue with what the noble Lord calls essentially military duties. Really we ought to press the noble Lord for Papers and for certain information. I would ask him whether he could not give to the House the communications, telegraphic or otherwise, that induced Lord Kitchener to accept this appointment, and, further, any reasons which Lord Kitchener may have given to the Secretary of State for War on his return from his tour in the Colonies for not continuing in the post which he had accepted. Are we to understand this, that the conditions made were found by Lord Kitchener on inquiry to be
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0457"/>
<col>863</col>
detrimental to the Service as well as expensive to the State, or are we to understand that Lord Kitchener asked from you certain conditions which he considered essential for efficiency and for the maintenance of that part of the Empire, and that His Majesty's Government refused to give them? Those surely are points on which we are entitled to demand information from the noble Lord, and I do not think that we can be put off, as a good explanation of the situation, by his statement that the one thing that the Government are determined to do is to go on with the appointment but simply to drop the title of High Commissioner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01911"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I might say a few words in reply to what has been said from opposite. In the first place, so far as regards the greater part of the speech of the noble Viscount who introduced this subject, his attack seems to me to be somewhat belated. I think I am right in saying that he did not make anything like an organised protest against the appointment of the illustrious Duke to this post, and that during the time that His Royal Highness was holding that appointment all the considerations which the noble Viscount has pressed so strongly to-day in a speech of great ability did not seem to have occurred to him. If they did, he kept silence on the subject. The noble Viscount at that time had general information as to the terms of the appointment, and now that the illustrious Duke has ceased to hold it he comes forward and attacks the whole principle of the thing as from the first.<lb/>
Neither was any demonstration of this kind made when it was announced that Lord Kitchener was likely to succeed His Royal Highness, and if the whole principle of the Mediterranean Command was so absolutely vicious as the noble Viscount and the noble Earl who has just sat down seem to think, I confess I do not entirely understand why a protest was not made before. The noble Viscount says we ought to have continuity in our military policy. Now, among the many qualifications for public life possessed by the noble Viscount his courage is conspicuous, but I must say that coming from him&#x2014;one of
<col>864</col>
three Secretaries of State for War in a single Administration extending over two Parliaments, each so far as I know having held and announced, as I understand, entirely different conceptions of military policy&#x2014;that observation displays even greater courage on the part of the noble Viscount than I should have credited him with.<lb/>
My noble friend has stated that the post of High Commissioner is not to be continued. I admit that the appointment of a High Commissioner in the Mediterranean has always been an experiment, and we are not above profiting by the lessons of experience. I admit that, so far as there are any civil duties in the position which we were all very glad to see held by the illustrious Duke&#x2014;so far as any civil duties attach to that office, it does not seem desirable in the particular circumstances to continue it. We all listened with interest to Lord Cromer's account of the various Commissions which from time to time have visited Egypt, and which he says have not always resulted in benefit to that country; but he will forgive me for saying that so far as the appointment we are now discussing is concerned, those reminiscences, though interesting, were not precisely relevant. It seems the title of High Commissioner is like a red rag to the noble Earl and other noble Lords opposite; but I may remind the House that a High Commissioner has exercised his functions in Cyprus for years past without anything very terrible happening. But so far as this particular military post is concerned, we quite agree that it is not useful or desirable to attach to it the special position which was held by His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught.<lb/>
It, of course, is a matter of regret to us that we shall not have the services of Lord Kitchener in this particular post. Unfortunately, at any given moment it is not always possible to find a particular post fitted for any eminent and distinguished public servant; but we do most fervently hope that the great qualities and the unique experience of Lord Kitchener will be held at the service of the country in some capacity or other, because we all feel that the great qualities he possesses should not be allowed to be wasted. The noble Earl who has just sat down asks in what way the position of this officer&#x2014;the Com
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0458"/>
<col>865</col>
mander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean as I understand from my noble friend he is to be styled&#x2014;will differ from that which was held by former occupants of the office. My noble friend has stated that he is to be Inspector-General of the whole Empire, with the exception, of course, of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01912"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: Of the Regular oversea troops I think the noble Lord said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01913"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think he said "Regulars," and if the noble Earl will reflect, he will see that what fell from my noble, friend about our hopes that there might be an Imperial inspection, if that should seem good, as I trust it may, to our great Dominions oversea, would not be in conformity with what the noble Earl supposes my noble friend to have said. It certainly does seem to me, assuming what has been said of the duties of the Inspector-General at home to be the fact, that he can hardly be expected to make a tour such as Sir J. French lately made; and I confess, speaking as a civilian, that it is a proper and rather attractive idea that all the oversea forces of the Empire should be under the supervision for purposes of inspection of one distinguished officer. The noble Earl who has just sat down said that those duties might so take that officer away from the Mediterranean itself as to make it possible that, in the event of an outbreak of war, he might not be able to conduct the defence of that part of the theatre of operations. That undoubtedly might be so, but still more might it be so if there were only one inspector for home and also for the overseas Empire. I may remind the noble Earl that speaking of the two great soldiers, Lord Kitchener and Sir J. French, they have at one moment both been very far away from where they might have been wanted.<lb/>
I understand the military idea to be that the local administration will remain as it is now in the hands of the various officers commanding locally in the Mediterranean. From what the noble Viscount has said of the number of these officers, speaking as a civilian and not on behalf of my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War, there always has seemed to me to be a large multiplication of commands, and that is probably due to the fact that the Governorships of Gibraltar and Malta have always been given to eminent soldiers. I will not enter into
<col>866</col>
that at this moment, but it does so happen that these two Governments, both involving command of a small number of troops, have both been given to officers of high military rank, and the multiplication of which the noble Viscount spoke arises to some considerable extent from that fact. The functions, I suppose, of the Commander-in-Chief will be generally, in addition to inspection, to organise the defensive policy of our oversea forces, including, of course, the force in the Mediterranean. Part of those forces constitute, as I understand, the Seventh Division, and the general scheme of defence in which that Division might or would have to take part would be under the control of this distinguished officer.<lb/>
As to the request&#x2014;I might go further and call it the demand&#x2014;for Papers made by the noble Viscount, I agree with my noble friend behind me that he can hardly be expected to say straight off that he will present all the Papers that have been asked for. Certainly we are anxious to give all the information that can fairly be given, but I should like to say two things. The first is that it is not usual, as nobody knows better than the noble Viscount, to lay Defence Committee Papers except in special circumstances; and in the second place, I should be very much surprised to find it otherwise than most unusual to publish correspondence giving the personal reasons why a particular officer has not seen his way to accept a particular appointment. I cannot recall any instance of the kind, and I greatly doubt if the noble Viscount can either. But subject to these general observations I am sure my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War will desire to give as much information as he can of the manner in which the idea of the Mediterranean Command was originally started and of the changes it has seemed to him and his advisers to make as the result of experience, and, so far as possible, in relation to the whole subject generally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01914"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help thinking His Majesty's Government must be grateful to my noble friend behind me for the opportunity of offering to the House some explanation on this most puzzling and intricate subject. The speeches which have been made from the Bench opposite have thrown a little light, at all events, on the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0459"/>
<col>867</col>
future of the appointment which we are discussing. With regard to the past history of this remarkable, I might almost say this protean post, because it has undergone so many changes, I am afraid we shall never have much light thrown upon that. We are driven to conjecture what were the sources to which it owed its origin, but one thing will scarcely be contested&#x2014;that is, that the latest phases of the affair are of a very extraordinary and of a very unsatisfactory character. Here you have a great military appointment invested with the utmost pomp and circumstance, highly remunerated, deemed worthy of tenure by an officer who is not only a Prince of Royal blood, but a soldier widely respected throughout the Army, and deemed worthy of acceptance by probably the most brilliant and conspicuous soldier at present on the active list&#x2014;I need not say I refer to Lord Kitchener&#x2014;you have this appointment resigned by the one officer because it placed him in an intolerable and impossible position, and refused by the second officer, after evidently much deliberation, on the ground that it is not one he can consistently with self-respect see his way to accept. The War Office has, perhaps, not been unused to rebuffs in the past, but I doubt if the War Office ever received a more tremendous rebuff than this during its long history.<lb/>
It seems to me, I am bound to say, impossible to conceive that there should have been any real justification for the appointment as it was offered to and accepted by His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught. Your Lordships will recollect that at the time when the Army departments were reorganised in 1904 a new appointment was created, that of Inspector-General of the Forces, to which great importance was attached. It was to be a check on the new War Office system; we were told that the Inspector-General of the Forces was to be the eyes and ears of the Army Council, and to be to the Army Council what the public auditor of a company is to the shareholders. The public, consequently, attached a great deal of importance to that appointment. The position of the incumbent of that appointment was perfectly intelligible, for his duties were duties of inspection pure and simple; no duties of command attached to the position. What happened? A new appointment was created, the appointment of High Commissioner and
<col>868</col>
Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean. To the holder of that appointment were entrusted not only duties of inspection, but duties of command, and he was, moreover, placed in a position which brought him, as my noble friend said, under no less than five public Departments, to say nothing of the risk of friction between himself and various high officers in the Mediterranean. It became evident to His Royal Highness that the office as it then existed was not one in which he cared to continue and he asked to be released from it.<lb/>
Then came the reconstitution of the office. What was done? The old confusion between inspection and command was continued, but matters were really made considerably worse, because, as my noble friend pointed out, new duties and new responsibilities were attached to the office. The High Commissioner was to have the new function of inspecting the whole of the African troops, and he was, besides that, placed on the Defence Committee and offered the post of President of the Board of Selection. One naturally asks oneself why, if those were to be the duties offered to Lord Kitchener, it was necessary to station him at Malta at all? Malta is obviously not the most suitable centre for such numerous activities. No one, I think, can be very much surprised that, though Lord Kitchener is a man of boundless courage, his courage failed him when he came to consider the possibilities unfolded by this most remarkable post. We have had really no explanation&#x2014;I do not think we ever shall have an explanation&#x2014;or sufficient defence of the manner in which the office was constituted or of its attributions either when it was offered to and accepted by the Duke of Connaught or when it was subsequently offered to Lord Kitchener. So much as to the past; not a very satisfactory past I venture to think.<lb/>
What matters much more is the future of the appointment, and as to that I am bound to say that so far as we have been able to follow the statements made from the Bench opposite, His Majesty's Government have at last come to see clearly that it is necessary fundamentally to alter the whole complexion and character of this post. It is idle to talk of it as a continuation of the same office. It will be a different office with even a different name. What I really understand is now
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0460"/>

admitted by His Majesty's Government is that the sphere of operations assigned to the Inspector-General of the Forces is so extensive that it has become necessary to make an arrangement by which some other highly-placed officer will relieve him of part of the work which has up to the present time fallen on him. The new Commander-in-Chief&#x2014;and let me say, in passing, that I rather regret that the title of Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean is still retained, because it perpetuates the old confusion between duties of inspection and duties of command&#x2014;is to have the inspection of all the forces overseas, with the exception of India.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01919"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Marquess's pardon. I think I made the same qualification. I think I said it was for the Dominions themselves to say whether they chose to join in with the arrangement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01920"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I therefore will assume that the Dominion Governments will be fully consulted before any step committing His Majesty's Government is taken. Upon the whole, therefore, it does seem to me, if I may quote the words used by the noble Earl opposite, that His Majesty's Government have not been above profiting by the lessons of experience. I think the experience has been unfortunate,
<col>870</col>
but it has also been instructive, and I am glad the lesson has been learned.<lb/>
One word more: I do hope His Majesty's Government will take to heart what my noble friend behind me has said as to the necessity of avoiding the needless multiplication of these high military and other appointments. These are surely days when some regard, the utmost regard, should be paid to economical considerations, and it is a little remarkable that the record of His Majesty's Government in this matter should be that which my noble friend behind me has given to the House.<lb/>
The only other observation which I will make is this. I can quite understand that there should be some Papers connected with this subject which His Majesty's Government may not desire to produce. On the other hand, it does seem to me that we are entirely justified in pressing for the production of documents which will at any rate put the House fully in possession of the precise terms upon which this important military office will hereafter be held. The noble Earl must be aware that at the time of the great reorganisation of the Army Headquarters Staff Papers were laid giving with the utmost detail the duties assigned to the heads of each of the great Departments; and in the case of an office such as that which we are discussing, and it is evidently destined to be quite one of the most important posts in the whole Service, I think the public is entitled to know exactly what duties it is intended to entrust to the official selected and what will be the precise scope of his activities. I hope, therefore, that His Majesty's Government will endeavour to lay on the Table of the House at any rate some documents giving the kind of information for which my noble friend has asked.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01921"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Motion is put from the Chair, might I have the indulgence of the House to ask whether the last proposal, at all events, of my noble friend Lord Lansdowne will be accepted? We have not got, so far as I am aware, the terms on which the Duke of Connaught held the appointment, and so far from my not having gone beyond what is usual in asking for this information I believe there is no precedent for such an appointment having been made without the terms and duties being laid on the Table of the House. I contend that the terms of these two

appointments ought to be laid before Parliament, and should have been laid at the time. Accepting the noble Lord's promise that all other Papers which can properly be given on the subject will be laid before Parliament, I would venture to ask that at all events the Memorandum describing the duties of the late High Commissioner and the proposed duties of the new High Commissioner should be given to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01922"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not like to trust my own knowledge on these matters against the infinitely greater experience of the noble Viscount opposite, but I was under the impression that as a rule the actual terms under which a Command of this sort is held are not made public. The noble Marquess referred to the case of the reorganisation of the War Office. That was a slightly different case, because the actual terms were embodied in the successive Reports of the Esher Committee, and it was in that form that they were given to the public. However, if the noble Viscount is right and I am wrong in that, I am sure there will be no difficulty in following precedent and making public the terms of this appointment. I will undertake to lay the noble Viscount's contention before my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War, and if it can possibly be done the terms of the appointment shall be made public.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SUPER-TAX ASSESSMENT.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01950"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> rose to call attention to the form issued by the Special Commissioners for the assessment of Super-Tax, and to their requirement that the returns shall be furnished to them at a date prior to the date (31st July, 1910) fixed in the Finance Act, 1909&#x2013;10, as that on which persons chargeable with the Super-Tax must give notice that they are so chargeable; and to inquire whether the "regulations" referred to in Section 72, subsection (2) are not regulations made by Commissioners under the Act, which by Section 93 are required to be laid before Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01951">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I fancy that there must be a considerable number of your Lordships who will find yourselves <ob/> some difficulty to comply with the return which has been requested, I may say which has been demanded, by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax. I do not know whether my case is a peculiar one or whether it is shared by a number of those whom the Commissioners imagine to be liable to the Super-Tax. But at any rate I received a communication on May 4&#x2014;I found it on my return from abroad, when, in common with many of your Lordships I returned to this country to pay the last homage and respect to my late revered Sovereign&#x2014;from which I found that I was expected, within twenty-eight days from May 4&#x2014;that is, on the 1st of this month&#x2014;to make a return of my total income for the year 1908&#x2013;09, giving full and detailed particulars of every separate holding, tenement, and hereditament, with the amount of the rent received and the name of the occupier. I wrote to the Commissioners, and they were pleased to inform me that the period might be extended to
<col>876</col>
the fifteenth of this month; but I venture to think that such a period is wholly incommensurate with the immense amount of labour necessary to comply with the requirements of the Super-Tax Commissioners. I think that when the Finance Bill was passing through this House none of us could have supposed that we should be called upon for these elaborate returns before anybody need make the declaration whether or not he is chargeable for the Super-Tax.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01952">It may be that my noble friend opposite who will reply to me will say that this has something to do with the action taken by your Lordships in regard to the Finance Bill. I have looked into that point. I find that the Finance Bill was presented to your Lordships by the noble Earl the Leader of the House on November 22, 1909, and that measure proposed that notice of chargeability should be given on the 31st of the following December&#x2014;that is, thirty-eight days after the Second Reading of the Bill, supposing it to have passed through all its stages and received the Royal Assent the same day. But in the Bill which has now become an Act, which was read the second time in your Lordships' House on April 28 of this year and received the Royal Assent on April 29, the date upon which notice must be given of chargeability for Super-Tax is July 31, or ninety-two days after the passing of the Bill&#x2014;ninety-two days as against thirty-eight days in the original measure. Therefore I do not think it can be said that it is owing in any way to the action of your Lordships' House that this extreme hurry is being pressed on by the Super-Tax Commissioners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01953">The Act provides that a return shall be made of the total income from all sources, estimated as for purposes of exemption under the Income Tax Act; and, further, by Section 72 every person is required to make a return of total income from all sources in the form and within the time required in the notice given by the Commissioners. I do not for a moment suggest that the Commissioners are not within their legal rights in demanding the return in such a form and at such a time as they may think fit, but I do venture to say that to call upon a large number of persons whose income is between &#x00A3;4,500 and &#x00A3;5,500 to make this return before they are obliged to say whether they are or are not liable to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0464"/>
<col>877</col>
the tax at all is to inflict a very great hardship upon those people. I have looked at the form under which exemption may be claimed. It is a short form, and amongst other particulars of income is that from property, including the value of the property owned and occupied by the person making the return. But that differs materially from the return now demanded by the Commissioners of Super-Tax, who require that the particulars of the income arising from the ownership of land, tenements, or hereditaments should state the precise situation of each property, the name of the occupier, and the rent or annual value, including in it a statement of particulars of any house occupied by a person liable to pay Income Tax. I thought possibly this might be meant to apply to larger parcels of land and that it would not be necessary to return every cottage upon an estate, but, on inquiry of the Super-Tax Commissioners, I was informed that they would be unable to dispense with such a return, and that it would be necessary to make it for every acre of land down to, I imagine, even an allotment. We heard during the debates on another subject that the Great Protector spoke of the "horridest arbitrariness." I think this is the horridest arbitrariness in the matter of tax collection I ever heard of.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01954">I cannot help suspecting that there must be some ulterior object in demanding this return, and that it is not wholly unconnected with the valuation clauses of the Finance Act. I am given to understand that, so far as regards personal property at any rate, there is no objection to the return being made in the aggregate, without describing every stock and share from which the income is derived. Up to now persons engaged in trades or professions have been required to make a return of their net profits. They have not been asked to give all these intricate details. And the penalty has been a severe one, but a light one compared with the penalty imposed by the last Finance Act. The penalty for making a wilfully false return is not less than six months hard labour. I should have thought that that would have been a sufficient deterrent even for such hardened criminals as those who are in the enjoyment of over &#x00A3;5,000 a year, and that they might have been relied upon to make a true and accurate return.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01955">It is not only a return of our income
<col>878</col>
from land that we are called upon to make; it is not only a return of our income during the present year, but it is a return for the year 1908&#x2013;09; so that the whole of the old past must be dug up. We must find out how much our bankers have charged us for our overdrafts, and how much they have allowed us in interest on sums which may have been placed on deposit. I hope that the latter may be considerably in excess of the former. But, at any rate, all this has to be done, and to be done within twenty-eight days from May 4. My Lords, it is a ridiculous and absurd proposition. I am bound to admit that I have had most courteous replies from the Commissioners of Super-Tax, who have assured me that they desire to avoid the preparation of statements involving the separate consideration of each property, but how that is to be done consistently with a truthful and accurate return, I do not understand.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01956">Section 93 of the Act provides that all regulations and rules made by the Treasury or by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or the Commissioners of Customs and Excise shall be laid before each House of Parliament as soon as may be after they are made, and if an Address is presented to His Majesty that which usually happens takes place in such a case. I have made diligent inquiry as to whether these regulations are available, and I am told that they have been laid on the Table of the other House of Parliament but have not been printed. They certainly are not available, and I do not think that any of your Lordships or any Member of the other House has had an opportunity of perusing them. Perhaps the noble Lord who will answer this Question will give us some explanation of how we may make ourselves acquainted with these regulations, because it appears to have been the undoubted intention of Parliament that they should be laid on the Table of the House before they were acted upon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01957">The effect of all this is to duplicate the complicated machinery of the return for Income Tax. There is to be, as there always has been, a collection of Income Tax at the source, and, in addition, there has to be the compilation of the results of the Income Tax after it has been paid by other parties. That is to say, there is taken away from the Income Tax payer all the advantages&#x2014;and they are great
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0465"/>
<col>879</col>
advantages&#x2014;of receiving his income after the tax has been deducted, and in lieu thereof there is thrown upon him an additional burden which he has never had to suffer before. I sincerely hope that the Treasury will take these difficulties into consideration, and, remembering how heavy is the additional burden which has been placed upon the Income Tax payer, that instructions will be given to their officials to do everything in their power to lighten the burden and expense of making these returns.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01958"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when the noble Lord opposite answers the Question which Lord Onslow has addressed to His Majesty's Government, I should be much obliged to him if he would tell the House whether the abatement of twenty-five per cent in respect of agricultural property&#x2014;an abatement on which great stress was laid by His Majesty's Government when they brought forward the Finance Bill&#x2014;is or is not to be allowed in the return for Super-Tax in respect of the year 1908&#x2013;09. The instructions that have appeared on the form sent to us by the Special Commissioners leave that matter entirely in the dark, and as there is great diversity of opinion on the subject I am sure the House would be indebted to the noble Lord if he could give any information on that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01959"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord replies, there is one question I should like to put to him. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, has assumed that the inquiries which have been made by the Government officials are all in accordance with the Act, but there are many of us in the City&#x2014;in fact I might say most of us in the City&#x2014;who have not been able to see in the Act any authority for the inquiries which have been made. The Act requires every person on whom notice is served to make a return of his total income from all sources, and it is quite true that in the latter part of the clause it is provided that this is to be done in the form required. But surely these later words are governed by the earlier ones. I certainly was under the impression when the Bill was being discussed that the return which had to be made was a return of the total income. But the return which is demanded is an entirely different one. The return asks for all particulars of the income. I cannot speak as a lawyer but only as a layman,
<col>880</col>
but I distinctly understood&#x2014;and I know that many if not most of my friends in the City understood&#x2014;that the duty imposed upon us under the Act was to make a return of our total income. Perhaps my noble friend, when he replies, will be good enough to give us some elucidation on that point, and explain how it can be made out that when we have the obligation of making a return of the total income we are also required to go into all the particulars which make up the total income. The task is rendered more difficult because the returns do not refer to the present year but demand particulars of a great number of incidents which when they took place we had no idea we should be called upon to set out, and which it is most difficult at this period of time to recover from the past. Take, for instance, Income Tax which has been deducted from dividends. We, of course, can all get the amount received in dividends, but it would involve a vast amount of trouble to make inquiries as to what particular amounts were deducted by the companies before those dividends were paid. The special question which I wish to put to my noble friend is&#x2014;By what right are all these particulars demanded when the return we are bound to make under the Act is not a return of all these incidental particulars but a return of the total income?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01960"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have also been struggling with a Super-Tax form, and I entirely sympathise with what the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, has said about it. It is a very difficult thing to get these details. They are, so far as one's ordinary business aspect of accounts is concerned, more or less fictitious details. They are not the amounts you have actually received, but the amounts which existed before the tax was deducted; and then you have to ascertain all sorts of Income Tax returns and annual values in connection with land. I confess I had not noticed that the return was required in twenty-eight days. I took it for granted that July 31 was the proper time.<lb/>
I wish to take this opportunity of raising a kindred question, and if the noble Lord is not able to answer me without notice, which I am sorry to say I have not given him, perhaps he will allow me to ask it later. There is another class for whom it was understood the Chancellor of the Exchequer had a tenderness&#x2014;the class who
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0466"/>
<col>881</col>
pay a tax of 9<i>d</i>. on earned incomes. This, I understand, survives for all people whose income is under &#x00A3;2,000; but I cannot discover from the present Finance Act or from any other Act when and how they are to claim it. I understand that those who have claimed have been told that they are out of date. Apparently the suggestion is that they ought to have claimed at some time or other before the Finance Act became law. I think the date suggested is September 30, 1909. I do not know whether it is seriously contended that people who are entitled to that abatement should have claimed it seven months before the Act was passed. That surely is a Gilbertian state of affairs. I should like to ask what is the date at which that exemption should have been claimed by those who are entitled to it, and, if the legal date was in fact a date that expired before the Act came into force, whether His Majesty's Treasury intend to insist on their pound of flesh, or will treat these people fairly and give them an opportunity of claiming the rebate to which Parliament understood they would be entitled.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, raised another question, to which I was also going to call your Lordships' attention, as to the laying of regulations on the Table. The particular regulations to which I refer are those made by the Treasury under this Act relating to the horse-power of motor cars. According to your Lordships' Minutes they appear to have been laid on the Table of this House some time ago&#x2014;May 11, I think, was the actual date. I tried a fortnight ago, and again to-day, to get a copy of these regulations from the Printed Paper Office of your Lordships' House. They are not available, but, as I understand, the forty days during which this House is entitled to disapprove of or comment upon those regulations are still running. A great deal may be said as to the power of this House in matters of finance, but here an Act of Parliament has expressly given this House the power to present an Address adverse to any of these regulations. It is a tall order to say that the regulations are to be laid in dummy, and that the period fixed in the Act is to lapse before you have any chance of perusing them, and that at the end of the time you are to be told that the forty days have expired although you have never had an opportunity of obtaining a copy of the regulations. I venture to
<col>882</col>
think that such a state of things ought not to occur, and that if a period of time is running as against your Lordships' House such regulations as are open to comment should be available. If my question about the 9<i>d</i>. tax cannot be answered to-day I will put it down for a subsequent date.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01961"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word on one point on which Lord Onslow dwelt&#x2014;I mean the conditions laid down for the returns with regard to land. It is an absolute impossibility for the returns to be made out within the time allotted, and even if a longer time were given I should think they would be unnecessary and useless to the Treasury. I pointed this out, and in reply the Commissioners told me they would be very glad to receive in total amounts the returns of any person who had to pay the Super-Tax, with a promise that when required schedules of the whole of the property would be sent in. That referred to agricultural property only. They admitted that with regard to town property it would be rather hard to ask the owner to send in a return of every small ground rent, and they thought that these might be given in larger sums provided they could be identified. It is with regard to that answer that I want to say a few words.<lb/>
In the first place, you are asked to make a return with regard to your income from property in land. You make that declaration upon oath, or at any rate upon your honour, and then the Commissioners ask you to supply them with information the only purpose of which can be to convict you for bad arithmetic in your own return. That appears to be an absurd proposal. Either you have done your best to make your return from the details at your command, in which case your return is probably right, or, if you have made a mistake, it is rather hard that you should be convicted out of your own mouth. What object can the Commissioners have in asking for these returns? I think the arithmetic which is at the command of any noble Lord who happens to be an owner of property is probably as good as that of the gentlemen who are being appointed Assistant Commissioners. Any one who has had experience of dealing with the supervisors of the Treasury, or who has been for any length of time a chairman of Income Tax Assessment and Appeal
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0467"/>
<col>883</col>
Committees in the country, knows with what care and courtesy the officials concerned always deal with every case. But the gentlemen who are to deal with this Super-Tax are not the courteous and painstaking members of the Civil Service with whom we have all had to do for years, but men specially appointed for the purpose. What their qualifications may be we none of us particularly know.<lb/>
Why is it necessary that you should send in the name of every tenant on your estate, the size of his occupation, and the amount of his rent? The next year his occupation may be changed, the size of his farm altered, or his rent varied. Agricultural labourers&#x2014;it certainly is the case in Lincolnshire&#x2014;are very fond of flitting, and a man on one farm one year may be found on a neighbouring farm the next. What possible use can it be to put a landlord to the trouble of supplying all these details when they can be of no value to any one, and when they must involve a great deal of expense? When you come to the question of ground rents in towns, it is ridiculous and absurd. Ground rents in towns, in the case of leasehold property, are very small amounts, and to send in all these details would entail an enormous amount of Work. I know pretty well what it is with a small estate, and I cannot imagine that it can be done in anything like the time, even if extended to July 31, in the case of some of the large estates I know of. And when the Commissioners have obtained these returns, how much better off will they be? They will not be able, except on the point of arithmetic, to amend or alter the return sent in. Therefore why is it necessary to put this vast amount of trouble and throw this useless expense on landlords when it is not of the slightest use to the Treasury and can only delay the very return which they want? If we are to be liable to six months imprisonment for making a wrong return, it is only fair that we should be given as long a time as possible in which to make the return; and nobody can possibly make a return giving all these details within at least the next six weeks or two months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01962"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word on one point which has been raised. I submit that when any paper or form has to lie on the Table of either House for a certain period
<col>884</col>
in order to enable objection to be raised, that paper or form should be <i>bona fide</i> laid and printed, and should be accessible to everybody. I remember that in the case of the Education Code the rule was that it should lie on the Table for forty days, during which time objection could be taken to it; but the Board of Education were in the habit of laying it in dummy, and I think Mr. Speaker in the House of Commons ruled that the time for objecting should run from the time when the document was accessible and not from the time when it was laid on the Table in dummy&#x2014;a most important principle to insist upon.<lb/>
This is not a question of politics at all; it is a question of the right of the public, through their representatives in Parliament, to have the full time granted to them by Statute for the examination of these documents. There are other persons interested besides members of the House itself. There are the other persons who come under the operation of this Super-Tax, and they might desire to communicate with noble Lords who are their friends or with Members of the other House of Parliament. It is essential, where Parliament gives a right of criticism of official documents before they become law, that this should be carried out in the fullest good faith; and I think it is merely trifling with the obligation to say that a document has been laid in dummy on the Table. I do not think it is enough even that the document should be laid in manuscript; we are entitled to have it printed.<lb/>
I saw complaints in the newspapers that for a time apparently the officials at Somerset House were setting up a claim to withhold this document regarding the Super-Tax except on an assurance from the person applying for it that he admitted his liability. That seems to be waived now. I have had two of these documents myself. Therefore I do not complain of not receiving the necessary notice; but we are not concerned with ourselves now, but with the general rights of the public, and I think we ought to safeguard those rights as against the Civil administration of the country. In my opinion the period of time allowed should run from the production of the document in an accessible form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01963"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, has called attention
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0468"/>
<col>885</col>
this afternoon to the form issued by the Special Commissioners for the assessment of Super-Tax. As far as my own experience goes, I am bound to say that it is no easy task to give all the information which the Commissioners desire in the forms they have sent out. But I can assure the noble Earl that there is no ulterior motive on their part or on the part of the Government in asking for this information. It is really necessary for the Commissioners to have the information in order to make a fair assessment. I believe that the experience so far has been that people have shown every willingness to give the information and every anxiety to make correct returns; but it is possible that there may be people who would desire to evade the payment of the tax, and it would obviously be unfair to those who have paid the tax if such people were given a loophole of escape. The Commissioners must have the right to inquire into the details of individual incomes, in justice to themselves as well as to those persons whose incomes are to be taxed. This form follows as nearly as possible the ordinary forms used by taxpayers who claim exemptions or abatements from Income Tax. Persons liable to Super-Tax are required by the Act to make their return of income in the same manner as income is estimated for purposes of exemptions and abatements.<lb/>
Then complaint was made by the noble Earl of the date on which the return has to be made. Subsection 2 of Section 72 gives the Special Commissioners power to require the return and to specify the time within which it should be rendered; but if in a particular case the time allowed is not long enough and the person can show reasons for delay the Commissioners will consider whether an extension of time can be given. Then Lord Onslow raised a point as to the regulations. These regulations were laid before the House of Commons on the 8th of this month. I believe they were ready some weeks earlier, but the meeting of Parliament on the occasion of the death of the late King was not considered to be an appropriate time for laying them on the Table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01964"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: May I ask whether copies of these regulations can be obtained, and, if so, how?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01965"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: As they have been laid in the House of Commons I imagine
<col>886</col>
that it is perfectly easy to obtain copies of them. [Several NOBLE LORDS: No, no.] I will make inquiries on the point. Indeed, I now understand from the Clerk at the Table that they have been laid in this House as well. Lord Hylton has raised the question of the abatement of Income Tax which was given in the Finance Act of last year. I think that point is met by the note on the form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01966"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: I know there is a note on the form, but it is not at all what was said by His Majesty's Government when the Finance Bill was brought in. Not only were we told that there would be no extra taxes on agricultural land, but we were to have a remission of twenty-five per cent. instead of the abatement hitherto allowed. But if we are to have the Super-Tax on agricultural land without the abatement of twenty-five per cent., that blows to the wind entirely the allegation of His Majesty's Government that no extra taxes were to be placed on agricultural land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01967"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: It is a little difficult for me to give definite answers to all the points that have been raised, as I have no official connection with the Treasury. But I believe it is the case that on application any person liable to the Super-Tax will be able to obtain the abatement to which the noble Lord refers. My noble friend behind me (Earl Russell) asked a question with regard to the date up to which the 9<i>d</i>. on earned incomes may be claimed. Again I must guard myself against giving an absolutely definite answer, but I believe that date is September 30 of this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01968"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: Several people who have made a claim have been told that they are now out of date.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01970"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask whether an undertaking will be given on behalf of the Government that the regulations in regard to the

<col>887</col>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-01971"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who spoke for His Majesty's Government towards the close of his observations made something of the nature of an appeal for indulgence to the House upon the ground that he was not himself officially connected with the Treasury. I am quite sure that noble Lords on this side would not desire to press the noble Lord unduly, for he, no doubt, was not prepared for the somewhat extensive catechism of questions to which he was asked to reply. But he must expect, and His Majesty's Government must expect, to be pressed for full explanation upon the points which have been raised this evening. I am sure I do not misinterpret the feeling of the House when I say that, however much we may disapprove of the taxation now under discussion, it is our genuine desire to facilitate the task of those officials who are entrusted with the duty of collecting it, and that nothing is further from our thoughts than to create vexatious difficulties in their way. But if that is our feeling, we have a right to expect that we shall be treated on the one hand legally, and, on the other hand, with all the consideration which the circumstances admit; and I must say that this discussion does seem to me to show that in both these directions there have been very considerable shortcomings on the part of the Department entrusted with this special work.<lb/>
First, as to the question of legality. My noble friend Lord Avebury raises specifically the question whether these particular demands with which we have all been supplied are of a nature which is fully authorised by the text of the Finance Act. He has been advised that that is not so, and I trust that we shall be told from the Bench opposite whether that point has been fully considered. But, my Lords, there is another point as to which there is no doubt whatever, and that is the very grave&#x2014;I would almost say scandalous&#x2014;omission which has taken place in the failure to supply us with the regulations which, under the terms of the Act, we were entitled to have laid for forty
<col>888</col>
days on the Table of this House. We are told that they have been technically laid, but beyond all question they have not been accessible to noble Lords who might desire to inspect them, and, if necessary, call attention to them. The result is that a considerable part of the time allowed us under the Act has passed, and that we have to that extent, at all events, lost the opportunity we might have had of challenging the regulations.<lb/>
May I refer particularly to the point raised by my noble friend Lord Heneage&#x2014;I mean the demand that we shall supply particulars, not only of our total income from property, but of the income derived from every single plot and parcel, no matter how insignificant, upon our estates. There is no doubt that that is what the document on the face of it asks us to provide; that is clearly stated. The noble Earl who is going to reply to me must realise as fully as we do what an extraordinarily vexatious demand this is. I am tempted to mention my own case. I have a considerable amount of property let in allotments of half an acre and an acre in Great Britain. In another part of the United Kingdom&#x2014;in the West of Ireland&#x2014;I have a great number of extremely small tenancies. Now the work of compiling a return in which every scrap and shred of a holding, every dwelling-house, every tenement, no matter how minute and insignificant, is included, is a work of the most formidable and onerous description, and a work which one naturally hesitates to throw upon the gentlemen who are employed in connection with the management of these estates.<lb/>
And may I mention one other little point bearing upon this. We were each of us supplied with a single copy of the form on which this demand is made. When I received my form I very naturally wrote to my representatives in different parts of the country. I referred them to the number of the form, and told them that I wished as soon as possible to be supplied with all the materials for filling my form up. But, my Lords, they one and all gave me the same answer: there was not a form to be had. They were told that these forms were not to be issued except to people who were themselves called upon to pay Super-Tax, and I saw the same statement made in a letter to <i>The Times</i> the day before yesterday. A
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0470"/>
<col>889</col>
gentleman there gave a graphic account of the manner in which he pursued and eventually ran to ground the responsible official, living in some remote office, by whom he was, apparently, not received genially. I do not wish to be too exacting in this matter. This is all new machinery which will not work at first without a certain amount of creaking, but I do hope that every effort will be made by His Majesty's Government to make matters as easy as possible for the parties concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01972"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Marquess for what he said with regard to the difficulty which my noble friend behind me has to encounter in answering a number of questions on this intricate subject. As the noble Marquess knows very well, it always happens here, by the nature of the case, that there is nobody who has first-hand knowledge of Treasury work, and therefore it is always difficult for the Government spokesman, whoever he may be, to deal with the question as fully as other questions can be dealt with by those who are conversant with the work of the different Departments. Consequently my noble friend has found it necessary to ask in one or two instances for further notice of questions put to him.<lb/>
The point brought forward by Lord Avebury, which had not come within my cognisance before, no doubt raises an interesting legal question. I understand the noble Lord to argue that the demand for any details of income is, or may be, <i>ultra vires</i>, according to the wording of the Act. I cannot express an opinion on that point, and, of course, this House cannot as such, except finally in its legal capacity, express an opinion on a matter of that kind. I imagine it would be open to anybody to refuse to supply details, and, if he desired, to take the question to a Court of Law; but personally I will not venture to express any opinion upon it, although I should be as much interested as the noble Lord to know what high legal authority would say on the subject.<lb/>
With regard to the general question of the laying of regulations, I have no hesitation in saying that there cannot possibly be two opinions that when it is provided in an Act of Parliament that regulations
<col>890</col>
should be laid upon the Table of either House or of both Houses during a fixed time, that period should be a real period, and that the regulations should be available during the whole of it. In this particular case I understand that these regulations were laid on June 8&#x2014;to-day is the 14th&#x2014;and if they are not available to noble Lords generally I can only say that I personally regret it, and I will make inquiry as to how it occurred. Noble Lords will realise that the Departments have been working under great pressure in this matter; and before he sat down the noble Marquess admitted that machinery of this kind could not be brought into perfect operation in the first year&#x2014;that it could hardly be expected that its operation would be quite perfect. But, as I have said, I will inquire as to how this has happened. I am certain, if there has been a lapse from what we all agree should be the usual practice, that it was unintentional, and not in any sense malevolent.<lb/>
As regards the question of the noble Marquess as to the necessity for supplying the great number of particulars which are asked for on the form sent out to those who are presumed to be liable to Super-Tax, I have not had the opportunity, I frankly confess, of going into this matter with the Treasury officials, but it occurs to me that the difficulty with which they were confronted was probably this. Either they had merely to rely on a general statement of income without any details whatever, or else they had to get a complete set of details; and, if noble Lords come to think of it, as regards land there seems to be no middle course between taking a man's single statement of his total income from land or adopting the course which has been pursued of asking for each individual holding. At least, speaking without preparation or having thought out this matter, it is very difficult to devise any middle course which would afford an assurance to the Revenue authorities that the facts had been carefully looked into by the person liable, and that he was not merely making a sort of general statement of what he believed to be his income&#x2014;a middle course between that and the demand for all these particulars, which I frankly admit, speaking as an individual, do seem in some degree needless. I am quite prepared to admit that it is a vexatious thing for a landowner to have to go
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0471"/>
<col>891</col>
through the process which the noble Marquess opposite has mentioned with regard to every allotment; yet I expect the Treasury answer would be that they either have to take a man's statement that his land brings in five, ten, or twenty thousand a year, or else ask for these details.<lb/>
Should the matter be raised again, as seems likely, I have no doubt my noble friend behind me&#x2014;and I will do the same myself&#x2014;will take care to be furnished somewhat more fully with the reasons which have actuated the Revenue authorities in asking for these particular returns. I will also inquire as to the other point which was raised by the noble Marquess, as to the difficulty of supplying a number of forms in cases where, for instance, there are a number of scattered properties under different management, or where different sources of income may be looked after by different persons. I have dealt, so far as I can, with the various points raised, and, as I say, I think it very likely that we shall hear more on the matter from noble Lords on a future occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01973"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we are all grateful to the noble Earl for his promise with regard to a future occasion, and I have no doubt opportunity will be taken to put further questions to the Government. But I only rose to ask one question as to regulations being laid in dummy on the Table and not being available to noble Lords in accordance with the evident intention of the Statute. Nothing could be more complete than the noble Earl's apology for any failing in this respect which has arisen under the administration of the Finance Act. He told us that, in his opinion, the forty days ought to run, not from the moment when the regulations are laid in dummy, but from the moment when they become available to your Lordships. This is a very old grievance, as was pointed out by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Sheffield. I have been familiar with it in both Houses for many years. There is a tendency on the part of Government Departments not to follow out the spirit of Acts of Parliament, but to lay regulations in dummy, and so curtail, or deprive Parliament of altogether, the period during which regulations may be called in question. The noble Earl has expressed complete concurrence with our view, but he ought to have gone
<col>892</col>
further. As we have lost a certain time through the regulations being laid in dummy, will be give those days back to us? The noble Earl must feel that, whether in this House or the other, the complete remedy is not an expression of regret from the Government, but what is in their power&#x2014;an extension of the time, so that the period of grace shall be the real one intended by Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01974"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: By the indulgence of the House I will endeavour to answer the question of the noble Marquess. I understand that, as a matter of fact, the regulations were laid in full, but for some reason they were not ordered to be printed. As regards the question of further extension of time, I should be quite disposed to admit that that would be reasonable if it could be shown that within the period still lasting for the discussion of the regulations it was for some reason or other really inconvenient for the House to consider them&#x2014;that is to say, that an extension of time was seriously demanded for practical reasons. I am bound to say that I think if that could be shown there would be a good case for extending the time. I do not know how far it would be legally possible to do so. That is a question which perhaps the noble Marquess would consider. The Act of Parliament says forty days, and I do not know whether it is in the power of the Government of the day to extend the time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01975"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The Treasury can lay fresh regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01976"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: On the merits of the case I take the view I have explained&#x2014;that if it could be shown that the curtailment by a certain number of days had rendered it impossible or difficult to discuss the regulations there would be a strong case for the course suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01977"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to think the point before us has reference not merely to the particular case to which attention has been called. The point is, What does Parliament mean when it says that regulations are to be laid and to remain on the Table for forty days before they become law? and therefore any interpretation adopted on this occasion ought necessarily to apply to all similar cases. As to what is legal in the matter, it really is what is the interpretation
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0472"/>
<col>893</col>
which is placed on the wording of the Statute. Surely Parliament, when it said that the regulations were to lie on the Table for forty days, did not mean that they were to be merely laid in dummy and not printed, and that the days on which the regulations had so lain in dummy on the Table were to be included as part of the forty days contemplated by the Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01978"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: We have not yet seen these regulations. Surely we should have some assurance that they will be printed, and that we shall have an opportunity of seeing them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01979"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Earl the Leader of the House could meet the suggestion of the noble Marquess opposite by withdrawing those regulations and laying them again. I cannot help feeling that unless something of that sort is done you rather encourage the Departments in thinking that Parliament can be treated in this way. I trust the noble Earl will see his way to comply with the suggestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01980"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like, with the permission of the House, to say a word before the debate closes. I think a good deal of useful information has been elicited from His Majesty's Government, and the promise from the Front Bench opposite that further consideration will be given to the points raised this evening which have not been answered will materially satisfy those who are interested in the matter. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said he could not see that there was any <i>via media</i> between a man returning his total income from all sources and returning a detailed statement of every separate holding that he possessed. I would like to call the noble Earl's attention to the form which is issued to those who wish to claim a rebate of Income Tax, because that is the form which governs the method in which the return for Super-Tax is to be made. As to income derived from real property, the return has to be sent in with the precise situation of all such property. I would suggest to the noble Earl that it might be quite sufficient to require that the parish, or possibly even a larger area&#x2014;the district or the county&#x2014;should be stated; and the reason I throw out that suggestion is, of course, this&#x2014;that the
<col>894</col>
Income Tax return is based upon the assessment for Income Tax. The assessment for Income Tax is something quite different from the total rent payable. Obviously if you cannot be made liable for Income Tax you cannot be made liable for Super-Tax, and therefore the amount on which you have to pay is the assessed value. If there is any suspicion in the minds of the Income Tax Commissioners that a return has been improperly made, the whole of the facts and figures are in the possession of the local authority, and all they have to do is to write down to the district where the property is said to be situated to ascertain whether or not the individual has made a correct return. One word as to what fell from Lord Hylton. If he referred, as I think he did, to the special allowance which is to be made under the Finance Act in the case of an outlay for the purposes of repairs and maintenance, I would point out to him that that allowance only conies into operation after the passing of the Finance Act&#x2014;namely, in the current year. The returns which are being asked for by the Commissioners are in respect of the year 1908&#x2013;09, to which year the allowance does not apply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01981"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: That, I believe, is not in accordance with what was said in another place and also here by representatives of His Majesty's Government when the Finance Bill was brought in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01982"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: I was speaking only from a perusal of the Statute, and not with reference to anything that was said while it was passing through Parliament. In any case I welcome the announcement made by the noble Earl the Leader of the House that the matter will be more carefully inquired into, and that instructions will be given to the Commissioners of Super-Tax to ease, so far as may be, what I venture to think is a very heavy and unexpected burden put upon all owners of real property.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EXPORTATION OF HORSES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01997"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> rose to call attention to the Exportation of Horses Order of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries of 16th April, 1910, which provides that" if the veterinary inspector is satisfied that a horse cannot be conveyed for the intended voyage without unnecessary suffering," &amp;c.; and to inquire whether the Order enables the veterinary inspector to prohibit its shipment if, owing to age, infirmity, illness, injury, fatigue, or any other reason, suffering will be necessarily entailed by the shipment of the animal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01998">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I desire to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture the Question of which I have given notice. It arises out of a reply given in another place, where the Parliamentary Secretary was asked whether it was the intention of the Board to put a stop to exportation in the case of all horses which could not be shipped abroad without undergoing physical pain. The reply was that that was a correct interpretation of the intentions of the Board; but when one comes to look at the terms of the Order it appears that the only condition under which the inspector of the Board of Agriculture can interfere is where the animal cannot be shipped on the intended voyage without "unnecessary suffering." I think the intention of the Board is to prevent suffering whether necessary or unnecessary, because it is especially stated in the Order that the suffering may arise owing to age, infirmity, illness, injury, or any other reason. Obviously, if a poor old horse which has met with an accident is put on board ship it may suffer a great deal of pain, although it may be necessary if the animal is to be conveyed to the other side of the Channel that it should suffer that pain. The question is whether it is necessary or desirable that it should undertake
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0474"/>
<col>897</col>
the voyage at all. I gather that the intention of the Board is to prevent suffering, whether necessary or unnecessary; and what I desire to ask the noble Earl is whether, in his opinion, that object is achieved, and, if not, whether he will so alter the Order as to prevent the infliction of pain on these unfortunate animals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-01999"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl is perfectly right in his surmise that the object is to prevent suffering of every description. A similar Question to this was asked in the Commons House of Parliament on the 8th instant, and the answer I have to give to-day is the same as that which was given in the other House. The terms of the Order referred to follow precisely those employed in Section 22 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, under the authority of which the Order is made. The Board see no reason to doubt that it is sufficient to carry out their intention in the matter, which is correctly expressed in this Question. I need hardly assure the noble Earl that, as far as the Board of Agriculture are concerned, no steps will be wanting to prevent any suffering on the part of any animal exported from this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02000"><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not speak with any special knowledge as to cruelty or otherwise in the exportation of these animals, but I do speak with some experience of the drafting of Orders such as the one referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and I am well aware of the difficulties which sometimes arise in that particular Office. My noble friend has made a somewhat cursory reply to Lord Onslow's Question. I am quite certain that so far as my noble friend Lord Carrington is concerned, he feels, with every man in this House and outside it who possesses humane feelings, that any unnecessary cruelty, or even as the noble Earl opposite said any necessary cruelty, in the exportation of these horses should be prevented.<lb/>
I merely rose to ask my noble friend the President of the Board whether, seeing the difficulties that sometimes arise from unintentional exaggeration in reference to these subjects, he himself might not pay a surprise visit to the docks whence these animals are exported, so as to assure himself and the country that the provisions
<col>898</col>
of the Order with regard to the prevention of cruelty are being carried out in a fitting manner. I do not speak without experience of this subject, because many years ago when I had the honour of filling the office which my noble friend now holds there was in the Press and elsewhere a considerable outcry with regard to cruelty in the importation of cattle into this country, especially at the port of Liverpool, from Ireland. I remember that on that occasion I took the opportunity of paying a surprise visit to Liverpool, unknown to any one except one of the officials of the Department who accompanied me. We arrived there at five o'clock in the morning, and we assisted, if I remember rightly, in driving the animals out ourselves. The conclusion I arrived at was that there had been some exaggeration&#x2014;I am certain perfectly unintentional&#x2014;on the part of those who had spoken on the subject; but, on the other hand, I was able, from personal experience, to issue a subsequent order to remedy the evils I had myself seen. With all submission, I venture to suggest to my noble friend that if such a course seemed agreeable to him in the present case it might assist him in speaking with perfect confidence as to the execution of the humane instructions contained in his Order, and he would be able to assure the House and the country that, from his own personal experience, he knew that the Order was being carried out in a proper manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02001"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl intended, I am sure, to reply to my Question, but I did not gather that he gave any answer as to whether the Order enables the veterinary inspector to prohibit the shipment of an animal if owing to age, infirmity, illness, injury, fatigue, or any other reason suffering would be necessarily entailed by such shipment. Can the noble Earl tell me whether the Order will or will not do that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02002"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: This is a case of the difficulties of the English language over again. I am not a literary man and cannot pretend to explain the English language; but I can assure my noble friend that every precaution has been, is being, and will be taken, so far as I have anything to do with the matter, to prevent any suffering, necessary or unnecessary, to these animals.</membercontribution></p>

<title>POLICE (WEEKLY REST-DAY) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02015" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02016">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02017"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill to which I ask the House to give a Second Reading to-day is one which can be described as of a purely Departmental character, which does not owe its origin to any agitation either of a Party or of a non-Party character. Indeed, I would venture to describe it as a long-delayed measure of justice to one of the most deserving classes in the United Kingdom. It aims at securing to the Police Force of this country one day of rest in every week. I think it will be a surprise to a great many of your Lordships that the Police Force, numbering some 70,000 or 80,000 of His Majesty's subjects, are without this regular weekly rest-day. Nearly every other class in the community have not only their weekly rest-day but their weekly half-holiday, and, in addition, there are four Bank Holidays in the year; but, as I have said, there are between 70,000 and 80,000 men in the Police Force of this country who do not have these privileges. Yet I think that every member of your Lordships' House will agree that the Police as a class are engaged in duties not less trying or less arduous than those of any other class in the community, and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0476"/>
<col>901</col>
that, after all, the duties which they perform to the satisfaction of everybody are duties which make other people's holidays, especially Bank Holidays, possible. On the very days when the general community enjoys itself most the Police have to work the hardest, and the fact that horse traffic in our towns is rapidly being displaced by motor traffic renders those duties more and more arduous as time goes on.<lb/>
The whole of life is being speeded up, and speeded up as much or more for the Police than for anybody else. I would also venture to say that the number of public processions and ceremonies, which could not take place without the guardianship of the Police, is increasing every day. It might not be out of place to refer to the recent funeral procession in London, which formed the subject of a special Message from His Majesty, congratulating the Police upon the efficient discharge of their duties&#x2014;duties which they performed, I think, to the satisfaction not only of Londoners, but especially of visitors from foreign countries, who without exception were singularly struck by the efficient discharge of their duties under very difficult circumstances by the London Police; and it was a matter of comment in the newspapers that on that national funeral holiday there was not only no increase of crime whatever in the suburbs, from which the Police were largely drafted into the centre, but very little among the large crowds who were assembled to watch the procession, and that this was so is without doubt due both to the active presence of the police and to the passive influence which the knowledge of their position exerts upon a British crowd.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I am perhaps wasting sentences in arguing the merits of the Police in your Lordships' House. I do not think that any Englishman would question them. The sole point really is whether this highly deserving class of men should have a compulsory day's rest in every seven. Arguments have been advanced in another place against this principle, although I am happy to say advanced without imperilling the passage of the Bill through the other House. It is a Bill which was brought in not by Government but by a private Member&#x2014;my friend Mr. Remnant, who sits on the Opposition side of the House&#x2014;but which
<col>902</col>
has been actively supported by the Home Office, and received the personal aid of the right hon. gentleman who presides over that Department. The arguments which they had to meet, and which they met successfully, have been practically three. First, that compulsion was not necessary because it was possible for boroughs and counties to put this weekly rest-day into force without compulsion. But, my Lords, I am afraid that very little movement would be made in the direction of a weekly rest-day if matters were left as they are now. Two boroughs have carefully considered the matter and definitely and finally refused to put this weekly rest-day into force. Something like twelve or fourteen definitely postponed its consideration. Only one has had it in force for anything more than a year, and only, I think, five or six have had it in force for one year; and I am afraid, in view of the fact that two important boroughs have definitely refused to put it into force and that so many have indefinitely postponed it, that unless the Act is made compulsory matters will remain practically as they are at present.<lb/>
Secondly, it is urged against the Bill that there is no evidence that the Police really want it, and no agitation on the part of the Police. I am willing to admit that there is no agitation on the part of the Police, but I would remind the House that the Police cannot, as other bodies of men can, form themselves into trade unions, and that although they have the fullest opportunities for stating any grievances, they cannot take advantage of combinations which people engaged in other professions can take advantage of; and I venture to think the fact that the Police are not organised places a special obligation upon the Legislature of this country to see that any grievances that they have are properly attended to and fully considered. I would further remind your Lordships, in this respect, that a Select Committee of the House of Commons inquired most carefully into the whole question and reported in the early part of last year. They satisfied themselves unanimously that some relief was absolutely essential, and that without delay. They reported&#x2014;
<quote>"After giving the matter their best consideration, your Committee are of opinion that the provision of one day's rest in seven would be the best means of affording this relief."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0477"/>
<col>903</col>
So that this Committee, who had a great deal of evidence before them and had the opportunity of finding out what the members of the Police Force really felt, arrived unanimously at the recommendation that one day's rest in seven should be given.<lb/>
Thirdly, I come to what I think is, perhaps, the real basis of the argument against this Bill&#x2014;the financial one, the fact that it will involve some expense and possibly additional cost to the ratepayers of this country. I am as strong as any of your Lordships can be against any increase in rates. I have as strong objection as any member of your Lordships' House to paying more rates, but I had sooner pay higher rates than see a deserving class of the community suffering from what I consider an injustice. And from the actual financial point of view there is one borough which affords a very useful example of what the total cost might be. The borough of Reading has had this weekly rest-day in force since 1903, and the additional cost in that borough has been equal to a rate of one farthing in the &#x00A3;. Other boroughs granted the privilege in 1909 and 1910, and the estimated cost in those boroughs varies from one-eight, two-fifths, and one-half of a penny in the &#x00A3; up to a maximum of a penny in the &#x00A3;. But the one borough which has actually put this in force for any number of years has been able to meet the expense by means of a rate of a farthing in the &#x00A3;. Further, it has been found that the fact of this weekly day's rest has had exactly the effect which anybody would anticipate of reducing the number of days sick; that the percentage of sick among the Police has been reduced in different years by rates varying from eight to two and a-half per cent.<lb/>
I may here remind the House that the Select Committee which considered the matter went into this question also, and reported that, though they were convinced that the element of cost was an important matter, the figure of cost was not the only one of primary importance. They believed that&#x2014;
<quote>"the London ratepayer may be assured that he will receive a satisfactory return for the small increased cost in the higher efficiency of a great body of public servants."</quote>
I do not wish to weary your Lordships, but in the Report of the Royal Commission
<col>904</col>
upon the duties of the Metropolitan Police will be found numerous references to the high importance to the community of keeping the Police in as fit a state of health as is possible for the discharge of the very onerous duties imposed upon them; and who can doubt that the general enactment of one regular day's rest in seven would have the effect, as it already has had in the borough of Reading, of increasing the efficiency of the Police? Those, my Lords, are the three arguments which I have been able to discover against this Bill, and in those ways will I venture to meet them.<lb/>
I have to point out to the House also that in order to make it possible for local authorities to put this Act into satisfactory working it has been inserted in the Bill that they should have four years before the Bill finally comes into operation. It is to be a gradual process. Secondly, I have to point out that the reason for this Bill not applying to Scotland or Ireland is that it has been advised that it is necessary to bring in for administrative purposes a separate Bill to deal with those two countries, and that it was not possible to bring them under the operation of the same Bill. I venture to recommend this Bill to your Lordships, and to hope that it may pass the Second Reading to-day and become law at as early a date as possible. I should like to see this long delayed measure of justice, as I conceive it to be, one of the first Bills, if not the first Bill, placed upon the Statute Book at the commencement of the new reign I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02018">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Ridley.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02019"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say a few words upon this Bill at the earliest possible moment, because, although I have not the slightest intention of attempting to throw out the Bill on Second Reading, I think there are certain matters with which the Bill deals and certain of the provisions of the Bill which ought to be fully before the House before it is read a second time. Let me say at once that I, like almost everybody in this House and out of it, am very strongly in favour of a weekly day of rest and of holidays, and I am sure the House will all have sympathy with the class on whose behalf this Bill is introduced. They are such a
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0478"/>
<col>905</col>
very hard-working body of men and in many cases are exposed to such very disagreeable work, that they should have one day's rest in seven.<lb/>
But I am bound to say that I rather doubt whether the wisest course has been pursued in bringing in the same Bill to apply to districts like that of the London County Council, to the large municipalities, and also to the most scattered parts of country districts. I believe that if this Bill had been considered on its own merits as far as counties are concerned it would have been perfectly easy to satisfy the Police and give them an adequate alleviation from their labours without bringing in such a stringent measure as this. With regard to the Bill itself, the point which I wish to bring before the notice of the House is no new one. It is one which we meet with every session, I was almost going to say every month, because hardly a month passes in this House without some Bill being brought in for the purpose of dealing with questions of local government, most of them what are called national services, when no money is found by the Government for the purpose of paying for these national services, which it is admitted ought to be paid largely out of the Consolidated Fund. There being no money available at the moment we are always met by this, that the county councils and the local ratepayers must find the necessary money.<lb/>
This, as I have said, is no new question; it has been going on for years. I can remind the House in a few words what the position is with regard to it. In 1901 a Commission which had been sitting with regard to local taxation for a long time, which had taken a great amount of evidence and paid considerable attention to the matter, made a Report. They proved conclusively that the burden on the local ratepayer was far higher than it ought to be, and that some relief should be afforded further than was given at that moment out of the Consolidated Fund. They proposed in 1901 that a further sum of &#x00A3;2,570,000 should be given on account of national services as additional grants to relieve the ratepayer. That was nearly ten years ago. But what has been happening ever since? Why there has hardly been a session in which there has not been some important Bill brought in by one Government or another which made alto-
<col>906</col>
gether new charges on the rates beyond those which were discussed in the Report of that Committee. I may remind the House that in the last few years there have been most serious charges for national services put upon the rates&#x2014;charges for education, in connection with which, memoranda and regulations of a very onerous character have been issued; for medical inspection of children; for the training of midwives; and recently also very large extra charges have fallen upon the rates in consequence of the change in traffic over the roads. Those are some of the serious matters which we have to protest against, not merely because they are new charges, but because they are put on the top of a state of things which it was admitted was unfair before they were brought forward.<lb/>
The case is admitted on all sides. The Prime Minister admits that there are undue charges on the rates. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has admitted to the County Councils Association, in the fullest way, that he entirely agrees with them that there is a strong case for a revision of the whole of this question. Yet while this is admitted generally, we have Bills repeatedly brought forward which pay no attention to the position of the ratepayer and put further charges upon the rates. Let me take the case of this Bill. My noble friend used the expression that it might "possibly" put some charge upon the rates. I can assure him that it will certainly put the whole of the charge upon the rates. The case of the Police is this. Government have admitted that the Police is a national service, and they have recognised that by saying that at least half of the cost both of the payment of the Police and of their clothing shall be met out of national funds. The whole of that was set aside in old days. What has happened since is this. When there was a considerable sum set aside in the Exchequer Contribution Account for the relief of rates, the first charge on that fund was made to cover the cost of pay and clothing of the Police. That was the first charge. Well, what is the result? When any extra charge like this has to be found it has to come out of the surplus of the fund which is given for the purpose of relieving the rates, and to the full extent of that charge it all comes out of the pockets of the ratepayers. It is quite true that a certain sum appears in your accounts which goes
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0479"/>
<col>907</col>
to help cover the cost of the clothing and the pay of the Police, but that all comes out of this particular fund. The more you take out of this fund the less there is for the other purposes of local taxation, and therefore every single penny that has to come out of this fund is an extra charge on the rates. It does seem an extraordinary state of things that, while it is admitted that it is a monstrous injustice which is being done to the ratepayers, yet private Members join with the Government in bringing forward proposals which do exactly the thing which they themselves condemn. I have ventured to make this protest because I do not think it can be made often enough; and although it appears to receive very little attention in the form in which it is made, I am glad to know that this serious matter is attracting the attention of the Government at all events to some reasonable extent.<lb/>
There is rather a curious provision in this Bill. My noble friend alluded to the first part of the provision, which says that&#x2014;
<quote>"If this Act has not come into force as respects the police authority of any county borough maintaining a separate Police Force before the expiration of four years from the passing of this Act, it shall come into force as respects that authority at the expiration of that period."</quote>
That only has reference to county boroughs. What is the provision with regard to a county council, or other borough? The noble Viscount made no allusion to it, and I am a little puzzled to know what this provision means or is intended to mean. I have formed a judgment in my own mind which is not likely to come out, but which at all events is a suggestion which strikes one at once. The words which follow the provision I have read are&#x2014;
<quote>"And if this Act has not come into operation as respects any other police authority before the expiration of such period as may hereafter be fixed by Order in Council, it shall come into operation at the expiration of that period."</quote>
Therefore this will not come into operation for any county or other police authority until an Order in Council is issued to say that it shall so come into operation. I have been fancying that it might be possible that the Government have in their minds the fact that they are doing a gross injustice by finding no money for meeting this charge, and that they have devised an operation which, if they are in a favourable mind
<col>908</col>
towards county councils, may prevent them putting this Bill in force at all until they have sufficient funds to meet the charge, or to meet a considerable part of the charge, which will fall upon county councils with regard to it.<lb/>
I will venture to make an appeal to members of the Government&#x2014;I am sorry I do not see the noble Earl the Leader of the House in his place, otherwise I would have made the appeal to him&#x2014;that they should consider whether it might not be possible not to put this Bill into force with regard to counties until there are some funds to meet this additional expense. I admit that will be a solution which will be of, at all events, some assistance to us. But what the object can be of putting county councils and the other police authorities in a different position from police boroughs, unless it is for some reason of that sort, I cannot for myself understand. I am making this protest not only on behalf of the County Councils Association. I am making it for every county council in England, because not a single day passes when we do not have representations from county councils in England with regard to this matter of putting new charges for national services upon the ratepayers. I do not know whether there will be any way of dealing with this question when the Bill reaches Committee. Our object had been to join in moving, in the other House of Parliament, an Amendment in these words&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that this Act shall not come into force as regards any authority, except with their consent, until provision shall have been made by Parliament for defraying the additional cost to be incurred under this Act out of some source other than the rates levied on the precepts of local authorities."</quote>
I am quite aware that in this House it is impossible to move an Amendment of that sort, and all I can do is to satisfy myself by making my protest as strong as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02020"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Earl replies on behalf of His Majesty's Government I should like to say a few words at the request of the Corporation of the City of Hull. They have had this Bill under consideration, and have looked very carefully into what the effect of it is likely to be, and they have satisfied themselves, as far as they are able to judge, that the enhanced cost which the granting
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0480"/>
<col>909</col>
of this privilege to the Police of their city would amount to represents quite a penny rate. I do not know how a small borough like Reading can escape with such a small rate as that which was mentioned by the noble Viscount in moving the Second Reading of the Bill. My friends in Hull have satisfied themselves that this Bill would involve an addition to their rates of at least a penny in the &#x00A3;. The noble Earl knows very well, as do all the members of this House, the extreme difficulty which local authorities experience at the present moment in keeping their rates down. The particular city to which I am alluding has unfortunately found itself in the position of having to raise a very high rate, and when the Corporation see that by this Bill a further addition is going to be placed upon them against their will, they wish to enter a most emphatic protest against it, unless the Government are prepared to give some assurance that they will meet the extra cost.<lb/>
The Corporation of Hull have had every opportunity, if they wished to do so, of giving their Police Force, which numbers nearly 500 men, a holiday once a week, but they found the expense of it would be so out of proportion to the benefits the Police would get that they did not think they would be justified in casting this expense upon the ratepayers. Now this Bill proposes to place this duty upon them compulsorily, and they wish to protest most strongly against any burdens being placed upon their shoulders by Parliament in addition to those which they now bear, and which have been referred to by my noble friend below me. As my noble friend very truly pointed out, half the cost of the pay and clothing of the Police as a grant from the Government has now ceased, and the proportion which local bodies at present get from the Government in aid of their various duties has fallen so considerably as to throw a very much larger burden on the ratepayers. I have been especially asked, on behalf of the Corporation of Hull, to say that, as representing the ratepayers of a very large city with large and important police duties, they wish to enter their protest most solemnly and strongly against legislation of this sort being brought forward without an assurance from the Government that they will do something towards meeting the extra cost proposed to be imposed by this compulsory legislation. They do not
<col>910</col>
wish to stand out against the proposal to give the Police the benefits which this Bill proposes to give them. All they wish is to protest against the cost being placed on the local ratepayers; and I hope His Majesty's Government will recognise that in this matter they are placing a burden on the local ratepayers which really may be described as unfair.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02021"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Lord who has just sat down and also the noble Lord below the Gangway will excuse me if I do not enter upon the general question of the proportion which should be borne by the Imperial Exchequer or the contribution which it should make in order to lighten the burdens of local rates. It is a subject which has been before your Lordships' House on several occasions, and I think it would, perhaps, be more advantageously dealt with as a question by itself as a whole than as subsidiary to the Bill now before the House. I would venture to hope that the noble Lord who represents the county councils in this House may initiate a debate on that subject, in which it can be gone into thoroughly, and on which occasion we may elicit very valuable expressions of opinion from various quarters of the House. I venture to think that would be more convenient than to deal with such a large question by a Bill, which after all, deals with only a comparatively small question.<lb/>
For His Majesty's Government I have to say, with regard to this Bill, that they have no objection to offer to its Second Reading this afternoon, and that they have themselves extended to the Police Force in London a similar benefit and are in course of bringing that benefit within the reach of all constables within the metropolis. It is a matter that takes some time; it cannot be done at once; but it is gradually being done. Some Amendments may be necessary in regard to this Bill, but I can assure the noble Viscount that they shall not be of any important or destructive character. The Government will be very glad, in fact, with the exception of the Amendments which I have mentioned, to give the noble Viscount every assistance in passing this Bill, and in giving to the Police Force generally, to whom the noble Viscount paid a well-deserved tribute, that advantage which already the Police constables in the metropolis enjoy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02022"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help making one remark in reference to what has just fallen from the noble Earl the Lord Steward. He says the question of the contribution the State should make towards local expenditure is a very large and important one, which ought to be dealt with by itself. I think your Lordships will all agree in that. But what is the corollary which I offer? It is that this being an important question, until it is discussed and put right the Government should refrain from supporting measures which are continually increasing the burden on the rates. It is a rather extraordinary argument to say that this House is not to spend its time in criticising Bills which increase the burden on the rates because this constant increase in the rates is such a serious matter that it should be dealt with by itself. I suppose your Lordships will unanimously wish well to the purposes of this Bill and the intentions of the noble Viscount who has brought it forward, but it does seem to me that there should be some restriction&#x2014;I am not prepared to say now what restriction&#x2014;which should give local bodies some voice in regard to the constant increases which are being put by the Government on the burdens of local authorities. We are always talking about devolution, about self-government; we are always talking about giving the county councils and the local authorities generally more control over their affairs; but what we are doing is exactly the reverse. What we are doing is practically putting local taxation in the hands of the Imperial authorities&#x2014;in effect, although not in name, taking all power from the local authorities as rating bodies. If we are going on, whether it be from philanthropic or other motives, day after day compelling local authorities to undertake duties for which they must raise rates, we might just as well begin to rate the localities at once by Parliament. I venture to think that some Amendment should be adopted which would give local authorities an opportunity of bringing before Parliament in each case the question of the additional burden proposed to be cast upon them by particular legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02023"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this short discussion has not, I think, disclosed any hostility to the principles of my noble friend's Bill. He paid a generous tribute to the value of the Police
<col>912</col>
Force, and that tribute evidently met with the concurrence of your Lordships; but I think he must have become aware that there are arguments bearing upon his proposals which call for very attentive consideration, and which may, perhaps, be repeated at a further stage of the Bill. I notice that my noble friend based himself upon the authority of the Report of a Committee of the House of Commons which dealt with this matter a year or two years ago. I have seen that Report, and I am not quite sure whether my noble friend has really read it with the attention which it deserves. As I understand that Report, the Committee recommended that this concession should be made, not to the Police generally throughout the country, but to the Metropolitan Police, and that recommendation, as we were told just now, is in fact being gradually carried out by His Majesty's Government. But I believe the Committee not only made no recommendation with regard to the whole Force, but in terms guarded themselves against making any such recommendation in favour of the Police Force generally throughout the country, and it must, indeed, be obvious to the House that there is a very material difference between the conditions of service of the Metropolitan Police, and, I would add, of the Police in large cities, and those of rural Police. What this Bill does is, in the first place, to put compulsion upon the local authorities to do certain things which they are perfectly competent to do, if they please, of their own accord. That is a proposal which, I think, lays itself open to the criticism made by the noble Duke who sits behind me, and my noble friend Lord Wenlock has shown that the burden thus imposed upon the local authorities is by no means a negligible burden. In the case of the city with which he is connected it will amount to something like &#x00A3;5,000 a year. That is a very serious matter. It has also to be borne in mind that this has been done without any full consultation with the local authorities generally in the United Kingdom. In cases of this kind every effort should be made to carry the local authorities with us when we are introducing innovations of this description at their expense.</membercontribution></p>

We have, moreover, to bear this in mind, that the only remedy for the financial injustice which I am afraid it may do in some cases is that there should be some inroad upon the Consolidated Fund for the purpose of coming to the rescue of the ratepayers. That, obviously, is not a proposal which could be made in this House, and therefore it seems to me that we are really precluded from almost the only step which could meet the main objection that has been taken to this proposal. I am glad to observe that under the terms of the Bill a period of four years grace is allowed to the local authorities before they are compelled to put this measure into effect. That may a little mitigate its hardness.

<title>JUSTICES AND THE OATH OF<lb/> ALLEGIANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02032"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to ask the Secretary for Scotland the Question which appears in my name on the Paper&#x2014;viz.: whether the legal advisers of the Crown in Scotland have expressed any opinion as to the necessity for Justices of the Peace to renew their oath of allegiance and the judicial oath on the accession of the King; and whether he is aware that a circular has been issued by a Mr. Stewart, from the County Buildings, Glasgow, saying that the Secretary for Scotland has stated he is so advised.<lb/>
My interest in the matter arises in this way. A few days ago I received a courteous but a quite distinct intimation that it was necessary for me, as a Justice of the Peace for the county in which I reside, to attend on a certain day and take the oath of allegiance and the judicial oath, and this was accompanied with an intimation that this was either necessary or desirable&#x2014;I am not quite certain which word was used. I happen to have held the office of Secretary for Scotland on the last occasion of the demise of the Crown, and I remember then that the matter was under discussion. It arose on the point&#x2014;perhaps not an unnatural one in Scotland&#x2014;whether fees were exigible for the purpose of remuneration of those who had to administer the oath, and, so far as I recollect, we were not only advised by the then Law Officers of the Crown that no fee was exigible, but that it was not necessary that a Justice of the Peace should take the oath. What I am anxious to know is, what has happened since that time which has introduced a change of view?<lb/>
The only difference on the Statute Book that I know of is that in 1901 an Act was passed called the Demise of the Crown Act. It is an Act of one clause, so short that I may venture to read it&#x2014;
<quote>"The holding of any office under the Crown, whether within or without His Majesty's Dominions, shall not be affected, nor shall any fresh appointment thereto be rendered necessary, by the demise of the Crown."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0483"/>
<col>915</col>
It seems to me tolerably clear that that Act has nothing whatever to do with the question of the oath of allegiance or the judicial oath in the case of Justices of the Peace. Therefore I want to know if it is true that there has been a carefully considered legal opinion given to the noble Lord opposite, as Secretary for Scotland, that it is necessary that Justices should take the oath. If that has not been the case, then it is quite clear that the circular, to which I shall refer in a moment, ought not to have been issued. But if there has been a distinct decision to the effect that it is necessary, for some reason or other, for Justices to take the oath, then I venture to suggest that the Secretary for Scotland and the Scottish Office should have made the necessary intimation of the change of policy to the local clerks to the Justices of the Peace. When I protested to the clerk to the Justices for my county, I was sent a copy of a circular dated from the County Buildings, Glasgow, which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"I beg to inform you that in connection with the accession of King George V the Secretary for Scotland, in reply to an inquiry, has stated that he is advised that those magistrates who have taken the oath of allegiance and judicial oath are required to renew their oath on the accession of a new Sovereign."</quote>
However important a gentleman Mr. Stewart, of Glasgow, may be, it is not either right or reasonable that a matter of this kind should emanate from him and his county buildings. If the Justices of the Peace and their clerks are to be given information throughout the whole of Scotland, I suggest that it should come from the central authority and not from Mr. Stewart. I think it shows what is at the bottom of all this. Probably there may not be much heard about extracting fees at the present time, but the clerks to the Justices are no doubt keen to look out for their own interests, and if it can be established that it is necessary to take the oath probably the next step will be that it is equally necessary to pay a fee for the purpose; and I do not see why, by a side wind of this kind, these gentlemen should be allowed to add to their remuneration.<lb/>
I may mention that in connection with recent policy the judicial benches have been largely added to. I have nothing to say against that policy. I believe it to be entirely good. Those who have been added, so far as I know, are discharging their duties to the satisfaction of those
<col>916</col>
concerned; but there is no doubt whatever that we are going a little lower down in the social scale for Justices, to whom the payment of a fee of ten shillings or half-a-guinea may be a matter of greater importance that it is to gentlemen in your Lordships' position. Therefore it seems to me that this is a matter which should be watched with some jealousy. But I do press for information whether there has been a change in the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown in the last ten years on this point, and, if that is so, why it was not intimated direct from the Scottish Office to the clerks to the Justices and not in the roundabout way indicated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02033"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I shall be able to satisfy the noble Lord as to how this circular was issued. The circular was issued by the gentleman named, but not with the direct authority of the Scottish Office. I believe he is the secretary of, or holds some position in relation to, an association of Clerks of the Peace in Scotland, or something of that kind. The circular was based on a reply which was sent from the Scottish Office to an inquiry to that Office on the point as to whether Justices of the Peace should or should not, on the demise of the Crown, renew their oath of allegiance and the judicial oath which they take on acceptance of office. Let me say at once, frankly, that the view of the Scottish Office was, I think, expressed rather too strongly. The word "required" is used in the circular, and it was used in one of the communications which was sent from the Scottish Office. Therefore to that extent the circular is justified in using it as the expression of opinion of the Secretary for Scotland and his advisers, and to that extent I must cry "Peccavi." That deals with the question of the issue of the circular.<lb/>
The noble Lord further asks whether there has been any change of opinion on the part of the Scottish Office since the former occasion to which he alluded. As a matter of fact, on the former occasion, though so far as I am able to ascertain&#x2014;I think I am stating the point correctly to your Lordships&#x2014;there was no opinion expressed, it is true that Justices of the Peace were required to renew these oaths. An expression of opinion more or less definite was given by the then Law Officers to the effect that it would be well for
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0484"/>
<col>917</col>
Justices of the Peace to renew their oaths. That being the state of the case, on the recent demise of the Crown when an inquiry was addressed to the Scottish Office&#x2014;I put aside the point as to the word "required" being used&#x2014;the opinion of the Law Officers was given. The <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> opinion of the Law Officers on this point was that Justices of the Peace should renew their oaths, and in that sense a reply was sent to communications received. I may also draw the attention of the noble Lord to the fact that the Lord President of the Court of Session, on the first occasion when that Court met after the demise of the Crown, stated to his colleagues that it was the duty of himself and of them to renew their oaths, and he then proceeded to administer the oaths to himself and to his colleagues. I think that correctly represents, so far as I am aware of it, the condition of legal opinion in Scotland on this point.<lb/>
I am well aware of the importance of the considerations which the noble Lord has urged in regard to the collection of fees for such purposes, and I am also aware that there is considerable doubt in the matter. The opinions, I think, on this question do not at all remove all doubt upon the question. I need not allude in detail on this occasion to opinions which have been expressed on the point in England. It is obviously for the convenience of Justices of the Peace that they should know exactly how this matter stands, and if it would meet the views of the noble Lord I should be glad to confer with the Lord Chancellor and my other colleagues on this point, and endeavour to find some method of obtaining an authoritative opinion or decision on the matter so as to allay doubt once and for all. I do not think I need add anything more. The noble Lord alluded to the Demise of the Crown Act, 1901, but, as he truly said, that Act does not alter the position with regard to the renewal of these oaths.</membercontribution></p>

<title>VOLUNTARY AID DETACHMENTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02036"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War what steps it is proposed to take in order to enable the County Associations Territorial Force to carry out the difficult task of raising voluntary aid detachments now that the central executive committee of the St. John's Ambulance Association have expressed their "inability to be further formally connected" with the voluntary aid scheme published by the War Office in August, 1909.<lb/>
It may possibly be within the knowledge of some of your Lordships that the St. John's Association have withdrawn participation in the voluntary aid scheme which was established by the War Office last year. This intimation was made to those interested by letter emanating from the central offices of the St. John's Ambulance Association on June 11 last, and it has put County Associations in a very difficult position. I do not propose to-night to go into the details, and I hope I shall say nothing that will add to the difficulties of the situation. Obviously some friction must have occurred somewhere, and I should regret very much if anything I said added to the friction which has arisen. In all probability later on there will be a full debate on the circumstances that have taken place. I think it will be sufficient on the present occasion to remind your Lordships of the skeleton of the scheme that was instituted by the War Office, the object, of course, being to make provision for what we must all admit is the necessary corollary of any home defence force&#x2014;namely, for the care and conveyance of the sick and wounded in case of invasion.<lb/>
The scheme itself consists in the raising of voluntary aid detachments. I do not propose now to go into the duties, which are various, and the responsibilities, which are great; but I think it well to remind your Lordships that in this scheme in the first
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0485"/>
<col>919</col>
instance the County Associations, who are charged with the responsibility of the organisation of voluntary aid in their various counties, were empowered to delegate to the British Red Cross Society their duties with regard to the raising, and that in order to assist them the St. John's Ambulance Association was also introduced in order to give the necessary preliminary instruction in the direction of first-aid and home nursing. It will be noticed that while the aid is voluntary the responsibility, as far as the County Associations go, is compulsory, and that this proposal brings into the scheme two existing organisations with fundamental rules of their own, to which, of course, they would naturally adhere. For instance, the St. John's Ambulance Association is a very far-reaching one and I understand that, while the normal number of classes held during one year is about 3,000, during the last six months, since the introduction of this scheme, 4,600 classes have been held. This shows how wide and far-reaching an organisation the St. John's Ambulance Association is, and where you bring in an existing body of this kind it is obvious that on the part of those on whom the responsibility is placed of providing the necessary arrangements for the scheme great care must be necessary to avoid any possible friction.<lb/>
By the introduction of these two existing organisations an endeavour has been made, so to speak, to put new wine into old bottles, and we know on very high authority that that endeavour ends in disaster, as it has in this case, one of the bottles, as far as the scheme is concerned, having apparently burst. What makes it more serious to County Associations is that the St. John's Ambulance Association is the foundation on which we have been instructed to build. With these few remarks I should like to repeat that I do not wish in any way to add to the necessary difficulties of the situation. My sole object in raising the question, now that our foundation has gone, is to elicit information from the War Office as to what means they propose to enable us to fulfil the duties they have imposed upon us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02037"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, nobody regrets more sincerely than I do&#x2014;in fact, than we all do at the War Office&#x2014;that the St. John's Ambulance Association have seen fit to take the step that they have taken in severing their formal connection with the voluntary aid scheme. We understand from them, however, that the fact that they have, in their
<col>920</col>
own words, expressed their inability to be further formally connected with the voluntary aid scheme, does not mean that they intend to cease the valuable work they have been doing in holding classes for the granting of first-aid certificates. As the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, has stated, the holding of these certificates is a necessary preliminary to the formation of a voluntary aid detachment. Nobody has hitherto been allowed to join until he had obtained one of these certificates. Therefore I hope that we shall still have the advantage that will be conferred by the holding of these innumerable classes by the St. John's Ambulance Association, and that they will continue to pass people through them who will be available for voluntary aid detachments.<lb/>
I should also like to say that we are issuing to County Associations in the course of the next few days an intimation that we shall henceforward be prepared to accept other first-aid certificates than those of the St. John's Association, which are the only ones we have hitherto accepted, provided that the course of instruction has been given by a duly qualified medical practitioner and an examination carried out also by a duly qualified medical practitioner, and also that the form of such certificate has been submitted to and approved by the War Office. That is a further development of the scheme which will be communicated to County Associations in the course of the next few days. I may mention that we are forming an advisory council, upon which we hope to have representatives of all the bodies concerned in this movement. That advisory council will be called together as quickly as possible, and will deal with some of the difficulties that exist in this particular case. We realise that it is essential to the progress of this scheme that the granting of preliminary certificates should be facilitated as much as possible, and while we have not got the faintest intention of lowering the standard in any way, of making the qualification standard any lower than it is at the present moment, we are going to do everything we possibly can to enable people who wish to join voluntary aid detachments to obtain satisfactory certificates as expeditiously and as easily as possible.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE SUPER-TAX.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02040"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance, and management of landed property referred to in Section 69 of the Finance Act, 1909&#x2013;10, will be repaid out of Income or Super-Tax now due, if applied for under the conditions laid down by the section; and, if so, how and when application for such repayment should be made.<lb/>
The difficulty arises under the construction of Section 62 of the Finance Act. The point is this. If under Section 69 of the Act a landowner has been actually repaid the extra twelve and a-half per cent. which he is going to be allowed he will be allowed to deduct that sum from the assessment which he makes for the Super-Tax. It is clear from the wording of the Act that he will be able to deduct that despite anything which is said on the Super-Tax demand note, but it is very likely that in many cases we shall have to wait so long to get our repayment under Section 62 that we shall have to pay our Super-Tax first, and in that case the difficulty arises that the duty will be repayable to us but will not have been repaid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02041"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think, roughly, that the answer to the Question which the noble Lord has put on the Paper is what I gave in reply to him on Tuesday evening&#x2014;that the abatement in Section 69 of the Finance Act, 1909&#x2013;10, will be repaid on application by the Inland Revenue. But as the point is of some importance, perhaps he will allow me to amplify that answer. The additional relief from ordinary Income Tax granted under Section 69 for the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance, and management is granted for the year 1909&#x2013;10 for the first time, and it is to be granted by way of repayment only. By Section 66 (2) (<i>a</i>) this relief is
<col>922</col>
allowed as a deduction in computing income for Super-Tax purposes, and then normally no question of repayment of Super-Tax will arise. The Super-Tax assessments for the year 1909&#x2013;10, however, are directed to be made on the basis of the statutory income for 1908&#x2013;09, and as Section 69 does not apply to that year the only course has been to allow the relief from Super-Tax for 1909&#x2013;10 by way of repayment. Claims for relief from Super-Tax should be included with the claims for repayment of the ordinary Income Tax, and the forms will shortly be available at the offices of Surveyors of Taxes. It follows that in filling up return forms for Super-Tax for 1909&#x2013;10 no deduction under Section 69 should be included. Although it is not strictly relevant to the noble Lord's Question, it may relieve the minds of some of your Lordships to know that the great majority of the details required for filling up the forms issued by the Super-Tax Commissioners are not likely to be required after the first year.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02050"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: That is the point; it is no section. I am referring to the regulations with regard to the Super-Tax. We are informed that we are to state the precise situation of our property, with the name of the occupier, and the rent or annual value. Am I correct in understanding the noble Lord opposite to mean that we are bound to give the names of every occupier of every cottage, the precise situation of every allotment, and other similar details? The noble Lord says it is legal, but would he point out to me the words in the Act which empower the authorities to make a demand of this sort?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02051"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: While the noble Lord is looking that up, may I point out that the only way in which these regulations can be asked for is under subsection (8) of Section 72, which distinctly says that the Commissioners may make such regulations as are required to carry out that section. I should like the noble Lord to show how it is necessary, in order to carry out the purposes of this section, that we should be required to give all these details. Moreover, when they have got this information it is not of the slightest use to the Commissioners. We are asked to send in the statutory rent. Now the statutory rent is the rent sent in in the demand notes in respect of Land Taxes and Income Tax. That is the basis on which those taxes are paid. Copies of those demand notes are kept in the office of the Supervisor of Taxes in each county, and if the authorities have a doubt about the good faith, honesty, or arithmetic of those who send in returns, they have only to ask these supervisors for the information they desire. I cannot imagine that any reasonable man would suppose that anyone would send in a return which was false when he knew himself that it was false, and that the supervisor in his own county would also know it was false.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02052"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: We are on an entirely different point from that in the Question on the Notice Paper, and perhaps the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, will give notice of his question.

I merely wish to say this, that the information is already in the possession of the Income Tax authorities. Why, because the Government choose to impose two different sorts of taxes, should we be required to make these duplicate returns? What Lord Heneage said a moment ago is perfectly correct, that it is of no possible use to the Inland Revenue authorities to know the names of the cottagers, or the situation of their allotments, or other minute details of that kind. On the other hand, the preparation of this information involves a frightful amount of labour on those from whom it is demanded, without any corresponding advantage to the Revenue that I can see. If the meaning of the Act is that the Commissioners have the right to demand any return they like, however useless it may be, all I can say is that we are living in a nice state of things.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE MEDITERRANEAN COMMAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02078"><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War, with reference to the proposed appointment of a Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, whether the next Colonial Conference will meet before 1911; whether His Majesty's Government will ascertain before that date, and before appointing a Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, if the self-governing oversea Dominions approve the idea of periodical inspections of their military forces by that officer; and, if they do not, how it is proposed that his time shall be utilised for the public services after the discharge of his services at Malta.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02079"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first part of the Question is that the next Colonial Conference does not meet before 1911. We were not proposing to ascertain before that date whether or not the Dominions approve of the idea of inspections. Our intention was to discuss that question at the Colonial Conference next year. That, we thought, would be the best opportunity of raising the question as to the advisability of making arrangements. We do not consider this particular question to be in any sense urgent, because, as noble Lords are aware, Lord Kitchener has only just completed his important tour of inspection in Australia and New Zealand, and Sir John French is at the present moment making an inspection in Canada. Therefore, so far as those Dominions are concerned, the question of making arrangements for the possible continuance of this kind of thing cannot be considered at all urgent. Consequently we did not propose to take any steps in the matter before the Colonial Conference meet next year.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0489"/>
<col>927</col>
But I would like to repeat what I said the other night so as to make it quite plain that, whatever may be the outcome of this, such inspections can only take place if invitations are given by the Dominion Governments concerned. That is the reply to the second part of the Question. With regard to the third part, we do not think that the future Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean and Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces will find any difficulty whatever in filling up his time before such arrangements, if they are made, come into force. There are, first of all, the duties that he has to carry out in the Mediterranean, and though, as we have already stated, we do not consider that they will take up the whole or anything like the whole of his time, yet they will undoubtedly fill a large part of it. His duties as Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces will occupy a considerable amount of his time, too. The principal places which he will have to visit are South Africa, West Africa, Bermuda, Ceylon, North and South China, Jamaica, Mauritius, and the Straits Settlements. Besides those there are a large number of smaller places; and, to give your Lordships an idea of the amount of time that this kind of inspectional work does take, I may mention that Sir John French left this country at the end of last year to inspect the troops in Ceylon, Hong Kong, and the Straits Settlements, and that those three inspections alone necessitated his absence from this country for nearly three months. Your Lordships will, therefore, see that this work will take a considerable amount of time. We have, as I have said, no fear whatever that the future Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces will find the fullest occupation of his time, at any rate up till the meeting of the Colonial Conference.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02080"><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may be allowed to say a word in explanation of my reasons for putting down this Question. The point is that unless it is made absolutely clear that the General Commanding-in-Chief in the Mediterranean is only to visit the oversea Dominions at their request, I am afraid there may be some jealousy and apprehension aroused in those Dominions at the idea that the Home Government claimed anything in the nature of a right to send an officer out to the self-governing Dominions in the ordinary course. With
<col>928</col>
regard to Lord Kitchener's visit to Australia, that visit, of course, was made by the request of the Australian Government, and I am sure they were very glad to see Lord Kitchener and to benefit by the very valuable report which he made; but I am afraid that they might take some objection to the idea that from time to time any officer might be sent out at the discretion of the Home Government with the view of pulling up the military tree which they had just planted to see whether or not it was growing satisfactorily. The noble Lord has told us that the time of the General Officer commanding would be very fully occupied in ordinary circumstances&#x2014;that is to say, even if he does not have to go out and inspect the oversea forces. But surely it must make a very great difference whether or not it is part of his duty to visit Australia, Canada, or Africa. My object was to ascertain whether, supposing these self-governing Dominions do not want his presence, there will be sufficient occupation to fill up his full time, and, if so, how His Majesty's Government consider that he will be equally busy whether he has to visit the self-governing Colonies or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02081"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad that the noble Lord has desired to make it even more clear, if that was necessary, that there could be no question of our sending from here any General Officer, however eminent, to inspect the forces of the self-governing Dominions except at their request. It is, of course, obvious to anybody who knows the conditions under which the Dominions oversea undertake their part in Imperial defence, that they reserve to themselves complete liberty both as to the character of the forces which they may think it desirable to have and also as to the training and equipment of those forces. But I think it is not less clear&#x2014;and it became quite clear to us who were engaged last year in the Defence Conference which took place between the representatives of the self-governing Dominions and ourselves&#x2014;that there is a real desire among them, so far as is possible under their local conditions, to attain uniformity of equipment and to a certain degree uniformity in the character of the forces of the different parts of the Empire. That being so, I think it is exceedingly probable that they
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0490"/>
<col>929</col>
will welcome, not so much perhaps "periodical" inspections, to quote the word which the noble Lord used, because that word looks rather as though we were sending out a man from here at fixed periods, but inspections at such times as they may by arrangement consider necessary in order, in the first place, to obtain the advantage of a first-rate military opinion on the spot, and also with a view to maintaining and preserving at any rate that partial, even if it cannot be quite complete, uniformity of training and equipment of which I have already spoken.<lb/>
My noble friend, I think, dealt with the question of time. I should be quite willing, if it should be thought there was any advantage in doing so, to inquire of the Governments of the different self-governing Dominions whether they wish to discuss this question at once or whether they would prefer to postpone consideration of it until the Imperial Conference of next year. As my noble friend has pointed out, the matter is, in that point of view, not extraordinarily urgent, owing to the fact that the forces in Australia and New Zealand have had the advantage of being inspected by Lord Kitchener, and that Sir John French is now performing the same work in Canada; and, as regards South Africa, I have no doubt the South African Government would say that they wished to be more firmly seated in the saddle before discussing the question of their own national forces in such a manner. But, as I say, if it were thought desirable I should be quite willing at any time to put that question to the self-governing Dominions.<lb/>
The purely military aspect of the question has been dealt with by my noble friend. I do not think that the difficulty which the noble Lord indicated is a very real one so far as regards the occupation of the time of this officer. As I understand it, he will be fully occupied as a rule in inspecting the oversea Imperial troops and the forces in the different Crown Colonies, but there would be a margin of time which, by arrangement, would from time to time render it possible for him, when on one of those tours, also, if he received an invitation from any particular self-governing Colony, to combine an inspection of their forces as well. It seems to me it would be a matter for friendly arrangement, and I should have
<col>930</col>
thought that it would be easy enough to fit in from time to time, because nobody can suppose that these inspections in self-governing Colonies would have to be very numerous or frequent. It would not be difficult for him to fit them in in the course of one of the tours which he would, as an ordinary matter of duty, be taking for the inspection of the forces in those parts of the Empire which we administer from here. I think that is all I have to add to what my noble friend behind me has said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02082"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure my noble friend's statement has made it clear that nothing will be done in this matter which will in any way hurt the feelings or invade the privileges of the self-governing Colonies. But I confess I think that the debate the other night left the position of the officer whom it is proposed to appoint in a most unsatisfactory condition, and as regards the discussion which has taken place this evening we are left in a very nebulous position as to what the functions of this officer are to be.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships that there are three points now under discussion. The first is, Does Sir John French require additional support in the matter of the inspection of garrisons which have to be inspected by him? His Majesty's Government hold that that is so, and in that case nobody, I am sure, would be more willing than your Lordships to supply or assist in supplying such inspection. Then comes the question whether this officer, who most of us would think is going to be sufficiently employed in Africa, is fit to undertake the inspection of forces in the self-governing Colonies; and the noble Lord the Under-Secretary added to the already unique functions of this remarkable appointment inspections in North and South China and also Bermuda, all of which, we understand, are to be undertaken by an officer who is to be resident at Malta, and who is to be Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean.<lb/>
I ask His Majesty's Government not to indulge in vague statements about development in the Mediterranean and matters of organisation, in respect of which we have no facts whatever or anything which will guide us, but to tell us frankly and fully whether this officer who is to inspect the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0491"/>
<col>931</col>
whole of the world, and who may be called upon to spend time in Australia as well as in China and Bermuda, is going to command in Egypt and to be responsible as Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean for the command of troops in what is not a British Colony but is still under the sphere of British influence? Is he to be responsible for commanding the troops at Malta and Gibraltar? If so, I would point out that the whole existing organisation of the Army is being overturned by which administration is left in one hand at the War Office, inspection in a second, and command in a third; and I plead for that distinction. If there is anything in the present arrangement it is to keep those three functions distinct. As far as I can understand, all three are going to be jumbled together in the vaguest fashion in order to keep up this appointment of Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, for which no man alive, except the spokesman of His Majesty's Government, can say a good word or find a reliable argument. I would ask that we should be told before this appointment is made, and not afterwards, whether this multifarious assortment of duties is to be continued.<lb/>
Next we should be told&#x2014;what I ventured to press His Majesty's Government for on Monday last&#x2014;what were the duties assigned to the Duke of Connaught which he found it impossible to discharge to the advantage of the country, and what were the duties proposed to be assigned to Lord Kitchener which he found, in his judgment and with his experience, incompatible for a Field-Marshal to discharge. May I plead that we should have a little of that clear thinking of which we have heard so much from the Secretary of State for War, and that His Majesty's Government should put into language that your Lordships can understand the answers to what seem to me the very legitimate questions I have ventured to put.<lb/>

<title>AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02085"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government (1) whether agricultural colleges and institutions which at present receive or may be entitled to receive grants from the Board of Education and the Board of Agriculture may also receive grants from the Development Commissioners direct; and whether in those circumstances such institutions would be subject to the regulations of three sets of Government officials; and (2) how soon the Agricultural Commissioners will consider schemes to assist agricultural education. I also desire to move for the Minute (referred to in [Cd. 4886] of 1909) constituting a Rural Education Conference for the discussion of all questions connected with education in rural districts.<lb/>
Your Lordships are aware that agricultural colleges are admittedly in great straits for Government grants. One of the greatest difficulties we had was the delimitation of the spheres of influence between the Board of Education and the Board of Agriculture, and the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture was able to inform your Lordships last July that an agreement had been arrived at between the two Boards. That was followed, in September, by the Memorandum to which I venture to call your Lordships' attention. It is not my business now to go into all the details of that Memorandum, but I regret that they are not more in consonance with the Report of Lord Reay's Committee. It had one feature, however, which appeared to be very desirable, and that was that His Majesty's Government intended to constitute a Rural Education Conference for the discussion of questions relating to agricultural education, and on which there were to be representatives of the Board of Agriculture, the Board of Education, the County Councils' Association, the Royal
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0492"/>
<col>933</col>
Agricultural Society, and other bodies. We were, according to this Memorandum, to have that body constituted last autumn, but it has not been set up yet, and I hope the noble Earl will be able to promise us the Minute this evening.<lb/>
I should like to say a word as to why I am pressing personally for this Conference. The matter is, perhaps, a local one, but I think it is not altogether untypical. Under this Memorandum the college with which I am associated in the South of England has been turned over from the Board of Agriculture to the Board of Education, except in very small respects for outside work. The grants from the Board of Agriculture have ceased altogether, but the grants from the Board of Education have not begun, and we do not know what they are likely to be because they are wrapped up in the peculiar block-grant system to which I have already referred in your Lordships' House. We were anxious to know what we should get and we met the Board of Education officials, who told us that we had been working on wrong lines, and that in future we were to have short courses and the whole system was to be altered. The Board of Education may be right or they may be wrong, but we should like to know what money we are going to get before we carry out this local revolution. I venture to think that a great change of this sort is a matter which should be brought before this Conference, which would be a very suitable body to consider and advise upon it, and therefore I would ask the noble Earl whether he cannot give us a promise that the Conference shall be called together as soon as possible.<lb/>
There is another authority besides the Board of Education and the Board of Agriculture which is appearing on the horizon, namely, the Development Commissioners. As I understood the Development Act, all grants to agricultural colleges were to come either through the Board of Education or the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;that is to say, through a Government Department. But I understand that the wording of the law is by no means clear on that point. At any rate, local authorities do not quite know whether they will or will not receive grants direct from the Development Commissioners, and I think it would be to the public advantage to know how the grants to agricultural col-
<col>934</col>
leges from the Development Commissioners are to be administered. Finally, as we hope a great deal from the money which will be received from the Development Commissioners, I would ask the noble Earl if he can hold out any hope that the Commissioners will soon get to work. I believe that a prominent member of the Commission is serving under the noble Earl the Leader of the House as Permanent Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office. No doubt that is a good thing for the Colonial Office, but we would like to know when we may hope that the Development Commissioners will get to work, and when we may see the result in some form of pecuniary assistance to agricultural education.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02086"><i>Moved</i>, That there be laid before the House the Minute (referred to in [Cd. 4886] of 1909) constituting a Rural Education Conference for the discussion of all questions connected with education in rural districts.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Monk Bretton.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02087"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can give the noble Lord an answer to his first Question at once. Agricultural colleges and institutions are not debarred from receiving grants direct from the Development Fund by reason of their receiving Government grants from the Board of Education or the Board of Agriculture. There is no prohibition in the Act forbidding grants in such cases, and it would be unfortunate if there were, as a number of the leading agricultural institutions in the country would be ruled out. Each case must be dealt with on its own merits. At the same time, care must evidently be taken to prevent overlapping grants and jurisdictions. Steps to this end were taken when the recent agreement was arrived at between the Board of Agriculture and the Board of Education as to the limits of their respective functions in regard to agricultural education. This was laid before Parliament in a Command Paper in 1909, and under it institutions giving, first, advanced instruction, and, secondly, instruction in a special branch of agriculture, were assigned to the Board of Agriculture; and the other institutions&#x2014;farm schools, county lectures, and so forth&#x2014;were given to the Board of Education, except that farms in connection with farm schools, of which, I think, there are three, are to be maintained under the supervision
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0493"/>
<col>935</col>
of the Board of Agriculture. As between the two Departments, therefore, there should cease to be, even if there were any in the past, any overlapping of functions.<lb/>
Though it is premature to make any promises until the Development Commissioners have recommended specific proposals, it may confidently be stated that it will be the policy of the Treasury to prevent overlapping between the Commissioners and the two Departments. In considering what sums should be placed on the Estimates for agricultural education this year, the Treasury, before the appointment of the Development Commissioners, had occasion to consider the point with the Board of Agriculture, and the Departments agreed that grants for aiding original research and equipment grants for agricultural institutions should not be placed on the Board of Agriculture Vote, but should be considered as charges upon the Development Fund.<lb/>
The noble Lord put a personal question to me in regard to a college in which he takes a great interest&#x2014;the college at Uckfield. There are only two of these institutions in regard to which the amount of the grant to be given has not been settled, and I am sorry to have to tell the noble Lord that Uckfield is one of the two. I am afraid I cannot say more at the present moment. Every application, other than those by a Government Department, for assistance from the Development Fund must be referred by the Treasury, under Section 4 (1) of the Development Act, to the Government Department concerned, who will forward it with their report thereon to the Development Commissioners. This arrangement we hope will be a further safeguard against overlapping.<lb/>
In his second Question the noble Lord asks how soon the Agricultural Commissioners will consider schemes to assist agricultural education. The Agricultural Commissioners are presumably those members of the Development Commission who are interested in agriculture. Your Lordships will remember that there were originally six, but these Commissioners have been increased in number to eight. Lord Richard Cavendish is the Chairman, and Sir Francis Hopwood is the salaried Vice-Chairman. The preliminary work of reporting on schemes to assist agricultural
<col>936</col>
education will be done by the Departments concerned, and it is not possible to state at present how soon the Development Commissioners will be able to apply themselves to this work. I have endeavoured to make the answer as plain as possible, and I hope it will to some extent be satisfactory to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02090"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think the noble Earl has answered the latter part of my noble friend's Question as regards the Conference to be held to consider this question of agricultural education. In the Minute which is in your Lordships' hands there occurs a paragraph to the effect that the Conference will be constituted by a later Minute to be issued in the course of the autumn&#x2014;that was the autumn of last year. We are now well advanced in the year 1910, and I should like to hear from the noble Earl when this Conference is to meet. I do not think that the Board of Education or the Board of Agriculture can complain that those who are interested in agricultural education have not brought this matter before His Majesty's Government. I have before me a number of Questions asked in the other House upon it. In March last a Question was put by Mr. Bathurst and replied to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, Mr. Trevelyan, in which an assurance was given that if we would wait a little longer we would find that there would be no delay in the Conference being held. Then on April 12 Mr. Bathurst was reassured by Mr. Trevelyan that every effort was being made to expedite the Conference. Again, as lately as the 15th of this month the President of the Board of Education, Mr. Runciman, stated that the noble Earl hoped to be in a position to make the promised announcement in the course of a few days. Those few days having elapsed, my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton considered that it was time the point should be raised again and an endeavour made to ascertain from the noble Earl why, notwithstanding those
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0494"/>
<col>937</col>
assurances, nothing has been done to appoint this Conference which has been promised now for upwards of a year.<lb/>
During the period I was President of the Board of Education I took great interest in the agricultural education of the children in rural elementary schools, and I did so for this reason. I considered that if we were to retain the children as agriculturists on the land in the future the objects and interests of agriculture could not be too early instilled into their minds. I remember quite well appealing to my noble friend Lord Onslow, who was then Minister for Agriculture, and he placed at the disposal of the Board of Education a very valuable gentleman, Mr. Dymond, who assisted us in the instruction of these children in all matters of country life. Therefore, having seen this system working well, I am anxious to see an efficient scheme of agricultural education set up in the rural schools of this country. It stands to reason that the curriculum in a school situated in a rural district should be different from that in an urban school, and that children attending rural elementary schools should be interested in the industry to which it is hoped they will eventually devote their interest. Time is flying, and those children who are waiting for agricultural instruction in rural elementary schools may be leaving those schools before having an opportunity of deriving that benefit which my noble friend had intended should be placed at their disposal. It is because I think no time should be lost that I regret that the noble Earl has not given a decided answer to the question as to the holding of this Conference. The noble Earl's colleagues in another place have repeatedly promised the representatives of agriculture that the Conference should take place "shortly," yet the Conference seems to be further off than ever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02091"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend says a word in reply to what has just fallen from the noble Marquess opposite, I should like to make one observation with regard to the speech of the noble Lord who initiated this discussion. My noble friend behind me dealt with the general question, but I think I can venture once more to reassure the noble Lord on this question of overlapping. He spoke of a third Department being brought in to assist in administering affairs which are already administered by
<col>938</col>
two Departments. My noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture pointed out that so far as it is possible to avoid overlapping in a mixed subject such as this particular kind of technical agricultural education the arrangements now proposed will avoid that defect. Of course, it is obvious that where you have to deal with a subject like education, which is under the control of one Department, and agriculture, which is under the control of another Department, you can hardly in a sense avoid some double action, even though you may do your best to avoid overlapping. But so far as the Development Commissioners are concerned, they will not introduce any third element which could be described as overlapping. What I take it would happen would be this, that in the event of a request being made to the Development Commissioners for a grant the matter, as my noble friend behind me pointed out, would become the subject of discussion between the Departments concerned and the Development Commissioners. The Development Commissioners, in considering it, would naturally take into consideration the whole scheme of such an institution as an agricultural college, and before deciding whether they would make a grant, with the administration of which they should not concern themselves, they would have to be satisfied, no doubt, on this question of overlapping, among others, and on the general merits of the particular case.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord opposite spoke about the position of Sir Francis Hopwood, the Vice-Chairman of the Development Commission, on which I ought, perhaps, to say a word. It is quite true that Sir Francis is still acting as Permanent Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office. That is an arrangement which, of course, cannot be permanent, but it is necessitated by the special rearrangements necessary in view of the creation of a new Department. If the noble Lord will reflect he will remember that it very frequently happens that for a time some important Civil Servant holding the position of Undersecretary is employed on work outside his office, as, for instance, on the work of a Royal Commission, which takes sometimes a considerable part of the day, and in an office such as the Colonial Office special arrangements have, of course, to be made to see that an undue burden is not thrown upon the individual concerned.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0495"/>
<col>939</col>
I can assure the noble Lord that so far as the present temporary arrangement is concerned, we do our best to see that Sir Francis Hopwood is not overburdened. He takes his share of his work at the Colonial Office, and is also able, I am glad to say, to give such time as is required in its initial stage for the work of the Development Commission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02092"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for not having answered the noble Lord's third Question, but I did not understand that he put all three Questions together. I may say that, far from complaining of, we are indebted to noble Lords opposite and members of the Opposition in another place for the co-operation and assistance they have given us in this matter, and we value very much Lord Londonderry's practical work in days gone by in this direction, which I can assure him is in no way forgotten. The Minute for the Conference was signed by myself on Saturday, and I believe it has also been signed by my right hon. friend Mr. Runciman, and will be issued without delay. It looks, on the face of it, as if there had been a good deal of unnecessary delay, but I think noble Lords opposite will see that it was not easy to get the answers all at once. We issued invitations to the
<col>940</col>
various associations who are to be represented at the Conference. Those invitations went out on January 15 of the present year, and the last reply was received as lately as the 9th of this month. It is a very large Conference. Forty-two or forty-three noblemen and gentlemen have consented to serve, and I hope that the names will receive the public appreciation which in my judgment they so thoroughly deserve. I will lay these Papers at once on the Table of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02112">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02113"><member>LORD FARQUHAR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have already had the privilege of carrying, on my Motion, the Second Reading of this Bill, which proposes to amend the Municipal Election (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, by applying the provisions of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1895, to municipal elections. The Bill is not contentious, and in the course of the discussion on the Second Reading when it was before your Lordships on September 16 last year the Lord Chancellor made a speech advocating its adoption by your Lordships' House. I shall not, therefore, on this occasion detain the House in moving the Second Reading. The Act of 1895 dealt with false statements in relation to the personal character or conduct of a candidate at a Parliamentary election. As the law now stands, slanders may be circulated about a candidate at a municipal election in a way that gives no opportunity for effective contradiction; all that the candidate can do is to bring an action for slander. This Bill will give in a municipal election the same rapid procedure for stopping the circulation of a slander as is available in a Parliamentary election, and will provide a penalty on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;100, with incapacity for five years from registration as an elector within the constituency. An offence committed with the knowledge of the candidate would render his election void. I think your Lordships will agree that this Bill will be one step nearer to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0497"/>
<col>943</col>
securing that purity of elections which we all desire. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02114">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Farquhar.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02115"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know that it is necessary to say anything in support of the Second Reading of this Bill, but I desire very earnestly to commend it to your Lordships' support. The history of this matter is somewhat interesting. When the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act passed through Parliament it was so heavily laden and so strongly opposed that, although this subject was considered, we thought it better not to include it within the terms of that Bill. Next came the Municipal Election (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Bill of 1884, and we followed then the same principle, and decided not to go beyond the Parliamentary Corrupt Practices Act. Then there was the Bill of 1895. I cannot recollect now why this clause applying to municipal elections was not inserted in that measure. The Bill applied to Parliamentary elections only, and I believe we left municipal elections out because we wished to follow the precedents of 1883 and 1884 to which I have referred. That omission existing in an Act which has been found to work admirably in respect of Parliamentary elections, my noble friend has good cause for asking your Lordships to agree to this Bill as a natural extension of the law to meet the evils which have been found to exist in consequence of its absence in municipal elections. Therefore, seeing that this Bill embodies a completion of the work and believing it to be absolutely necessary, I could not refrain from thus speaking in its support and saying how indebted we are to my noble friend for its introduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02116"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as this Bill has already received the support of your Lordships' House and is a non-contentious measure I shall be very brief in supporting it. An Act is in force for the protection of candidates at Parliamentary elections, and there is every reason to believe that some such Act is necessary for the protection of those who take part in municipal elections. Of late years municipal contests have been very keen. Although public interest in local government is a good thing in itself it does bring with it certain disadvantages, such as
<col>944</col>
extreme party feeling; and among the more unscrupulous this has sometimes led to attacks on candidates by the circulation of lying rumours on the eve of the poll in the hope that they may affect the result before contradiction could be made public. Under the ordinary law an action is difficult in such a case. Mr. Baron Pollock has given us an example of what would come within the meaning of the Act as regards Parliamentary elections. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"Supposing any gentleman in a county constituency was to say of his adversary that he had shot a fox, and he said it for the purpose of working upon the minds of his constituency during an election, that would certainly come within the meaning of the Act."</quote>
Very often in municipal elections accusations are made which seriously affect the character, integrity, and private life of individuals, and I happen to know that in some districts difficulties have arisen recently in finding candidates for the borough council elections owing to the cowardly attacks resorted to. Therefore I think it is very necessary that the protection which has been given to those taking part in Parliamentary elections should be extended to those taking part in municipal elections.<lb/>
There is only one other remark I should like to make. The operative clause of this Bill is an example of legislation by reference, and it is, therefore, unintelligible to the ordinary mind. It is, I believe, a novel departure to set out, as is done in this case, a Memorandum to the Bill giving the exact effect upon the law which the passing of the measure would have. This House has had before it a considerable amount of legislation by reference emanating from Government Departments, who have not always been so considerate. I know that it is often impossible to avoid legislation by reference, but I think that a Memorandum of this sort is a great convenience; and therefore, as one who has spent some time and trouble in struggling with Bills which legislate by reference, I should like to congratulate the noble Lord on the form in which he has presented this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DISCONTINUANCE OF STANDING<lb/> COMMITTEE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02141">Order of the Day read for the consideration of the Report from the Select Committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02142"><member>THE EAEL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask your Lordships to give your approval to the Report which has been presented by the Select Committee whom your Lordships appointed to consider and report upon the Standing Orders relating to Standing Committees. This Committee met; the noble Earl who leads the House and the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, together with other members,
<quote>&#x2020; Earl Beanchamp was appointed Lord President of the Council on June 16 in the place of Viscount Wolverhampton, resigned.</quote>
<col>948</col>
were present; and we took into consideration the Standing Orders, ultimately arriving at the decision to advise your Lordships&#x2014;
<quote>"That it is not expedient, under present circumstances, to continue the Standing Committee, and that Standing Orders Nos. XLV to LIII inclusive be repealed."</quote>
The Standing Orders in question are those under which the Standing Committee was appointed, and under which it conducts its procedure. I do not think that I need detain your Lordships at any great length, and therefore I will very briefly recapitulate the history of the Standing Committee and the circumstances in which the Select Committee ask your Lordships no longer to continue it.<lb/>
The Standing Committee took its origin in the year 1889. It was the late Lord Herschell who moved that the Standing Orders relating to these matters be considered, and he himself took an active part in establishing the Standing Committee. He considered that it would be very advantageous that your Lordships, acting as a court of revision, should go more minutely into the details of all the Bills which are submitted to this House, and especially of the less important Bills; and he also considered that an additional stage in the passing of a Bill through the House was desirable as a means of looking into its contents. That was approved, and the Standing Orders were passed in, I think, the month of February, 1889. But under the Standing Orders that were then passed the Standing Committee took priority over the Committee of the Whole House, and became much more important than, I think, Lord Herschell had originally contemplated. I myself happen to have been a member of that Committee from the beginning. During the first two or three years it was very largely attended, and considerable deliberation took place on the Bills that were submitted to it. Amendments of importance and of substance were introduced in the Standing Committee, and after that Committee had considered the Bills they returned to the whole House. The result was that members of your Lordships' House who were not members of the Standing Committee took exception to this procedure. They pointed out that when they wished to raise matters in Committee of the Whole House the reply was not infrequently made that the matter bad been considered in the Standing
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0500"/>
<col>949</col>
Committee, and that already an Amendment had been adopted or rejected with regard to the particular point in question.<lb/>
Owing to that and to other matters another Committee was appointed, I believe on the motion of Lord Cadogan, who was Lord Privy Seal at the time, to look into these Standing Orders, and the late Lord Salisbury, in the debate that then took place, said he thought that one means of meeting the difficulty which had arisen was to postpone the Standing Committee stage until after that of the Committee of the Whole House, and he expressed the opinion that the Standing Committee would not be too modest or unwilling to deal with Bills after they had been through Committee of the Whole House. The Committee appointed to look into the matter reported in favour of that procedure, which was adopted, and the Standing Orders were passed in the form in which they now stand. But then it was found that what Lord Salisbury had expected would happen did not happen, and from the year 1891, when the new Standing Orders came into force, the proceedings of the Standing Committee excited less and less interest, the attendances became very much smaller, and then the practice arose of moving that the Standing Committee be negatived. Those of your Lordships who have been members of the House for the last few years know how much more common that Motion has become, until, indeed, it is the ordinary Motion to make. If a noble Lord who has a Bill does not make that Motion the only result is that his Bill is delayed for a week, or it may be for a fortnight, and I do not know that any commensurate public advantage is derived from that process; and with regard to Bills emanating from the Government and other important Bills, they would not be altered in Standing Committee unless it were a mere verbal alteration. Therefore from every point of view the Standing Committee, at all events in its present form, has ceased to be of any practical use to legislation.<lb/>
The Select Committee considered the Standing Orders from this point of view, and, speaking generally, the conclusion they arrived at was that the Standing Orders in question should be repealed. Let me point out that if your Lordships should adopt this Report it does not preclude any noble Lord hereafter, if a
<col>950</col>
Bill comes up in which he takes especial interest or which, he thinks ought to be examined very minutely, from moving that it be referred to a Select Committee. Nor, again, is there anything to prevent any of your Lordships hereafter, if you think that some additional procedure is required, from submitting to the House any proposal which you may wish to make in this direction. I think that is all I need trouble the House with, at the present moment at all events, and I beg to move that your Lordships approve of this Report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02144"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend who has just sat down acted as Chairman of the Select Committee which was appointed to consider this subject, and he speaks with an authority we all recognise, from the deep interest which he has always taken in the business of the House and from his long experience of it. I merely rise to say that after giving such consideration as I could to the matter I concur in practically everything that has fallen from the noble Earl. He has given a history of how the Standing Committee came into being, of how it flourished for a time, and how it has since fallen into decay, and I think the facts as he has stated them go to show that it is useless, and indeed undesirable, to attempt to keep nominally alive an institution such as the Standing Committee, of which the real usefulness has departed. I think, perhaps, there may be one rather hopeful and pleasant side to this. I do not know whether other noble Lords, looking back, will concur with me, but I think there has been of late years a greater willingness in the full House to consider carefully and at length Bills in Committee than there used to be in former years, and, so far, that is a fact with which we should all be pleased, and it tends to indicate further that the functions of the Standing Committee as such are not so important as they were formerly supposed to be.<lb/>
I think it is quite clear that the date of the decay of the Standing Committee was the change, which the noble Earl has described, when its proceedings succeeded instead of preceding consideration in
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0501"/>
<col>951</col>
Committee of the Whole House. Before that time, as I very well remember, its proceedings were often interesting, and sometimes, indeed, even animated, but it had the vice for a Committee of being too strongly composed. A majority of the noble Lords who take, or took at that time, a very active part in the business of the House served upon it, and the result was, as the noble Earl has described, that when Bills came back to the House after being considered there any noble Lord who did not happen to be a member of the Standing Committee was certainly in a weak position if he desired to make any material alteration in a Bill. That was the cause of the change, and the change was the cause of the gradual decay of the Standing Committee. I therefore have merely to say that we on this side are prepared to support the suggestion of the noble Earl, agreeing also with him that such a decision would be reached without prejudice to any subsequent changes which any noble Lord may be able to persuade the House to make with regard to the consideration of Bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02145"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only rise to express my satisfaction that the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, concluded his remarks by saying that if your Lordships adopt this Report and go further and rescind the Standing Orders which have been passed by the House for the constitution and proceedings of the Standing Committee, that action will not in any way preclude a revival of the subject at a later date, and the constitution of some form of Committee, different and distinct from the present Standing Committee, for the consideration of Bills. It has always seemed to me that your Lordships as a House of revision have, perhaps, not devoted that careful attention to the drafting and the phraseology of measures which might be expected of a Second Chamber, and I therefore feel that if any Committee of the kind is to be set up at a future date its main object should be the consideration of the way in which a Bill would be regarded by learned Judges on the Bench, and the way in which they would interpret it. It is common knowledge among your Lordships that learned Judges have often said that they have the greatest difficulty in interpreting the intentions of the Legislature by the phraseology put into Acts of Parliament;
<col>952</col>
and for that reason I venture to hope that, if the Standing Committee is abolished in this session, an opportunity will arise before very long for a reconsideration of the subject, and for setting up some other body of the same kind to examine into the details of the legislation which is submitted to the consideration of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02146"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have really nothing to add to what has been said by my noble friend behind me and by the noble Earl opposite. It seems to me to be clearly established that the moment has arrived for, if I may use the expression, decently interring the Standing Committee. It has not only ceased to be practically useful as an assistance to our deliberations, but the repeated habit of moving that the stage be dispensed with seems to me to be hardly a dignified addition to our manner of conducting business. My noble friend gave a correct account of the history of this question. I have no doubt it is the case that the Standing Committee began to lose importance from the moment when that stage of the Bill was taken after the stage of Committee of the Whole House. I therefore support the proposal of my noble friend, and I do so with the same reservation as the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees has made&#x2014;the reservation, namely, that our decision this afternoon does not in the least preclude us hereafter from considering whether, perhaps in some other form, the proposal from which so much was originally expected may be usefully revived.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARSONAGES BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02151" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02152">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02153"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not detain your Lordships many moments in saying a word or two about a Bill which is extremely technical&#x2014;so technical that if any one of your Lordships by reading it is able to know exactly what the changes are that it will effect I shall congratulate him on his knowledge of ecclesiastical procedure and ecclesiastical law. I think I can explain the Bill in a few sentences, and then trust your Lordships to find that the words which set out the meaning of it in necessarily extremely technical language correspond with my explanation. It is a small change that is desired to be effected, and a change which can by no possibility, as it seems to me, do harm to anybody.<lb/>
The facts are simply these. At this moment, when property belonging to an ecclesiastical benefice is sold, through the medium of the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, whether it be the house, or land, or anything else belonging to the benefice, the money so received is placed in the hands of the Governors, who hold it as trustees. That, of course, is to prevent the incumbent for the time being from making use of the money so received instead of allowing it to be used for the benefit of the benefice. The Acts which allow the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty to hold money in that way belong to different dates and deal with different kinds of property, and in consequence a certain irregularity or confusion has arisen. By the existing law or laws as they stand, if an incumbent sells a farm belonging to his benefice for, say, &#x00A3;100, that money is placed in the hands of the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, who hold it for the benefit of the living and pay the incumbent a proper interest on that money as part of their general property. If, however, he happens to sell the house of the benefice, by a curious accident in the Acts which provide for it that investment is not allowed to become part of the properties held in trust by the Governors as a whole, but must be separately invested, and by the present Order, dated many, many years ago, must be invested in Consols.
<col>954</col>
The result is that the incumbent takes the risk of a rise, or fall in Consols, and the Governors have the inconvenience of holding different investments. What we ask in the first part of this Bill is merely that the Governors may have power to add the money which is derived from the sale of a house to the money which is held for the benefit of that living and which is derived from any other source. That is the object of the first part of the Bill.<lb/>
The second point is this. When a house is sold, as matters now stand even if for a time the incumbent be houseless, the interest on the capital sum received&#x2014;which is sometimes very large, many of the houses disposed of being sold because they are too big&#x2014;is not allowed to be used for housing him pending the provision of a new house, and the man is not only houseless but is unable to obtain the money to provide quarters elsewhere pending the provision of another house. I could give your Lordships many instances of the difficulties which have arisen in towns, and sometimes harm has come from a man's being unable to tide over that temporary time of inconvenience, and in many cases the sale of an inconvenient house has been prevented in consequence of this provision. Again we leave to the Governors discretion to allow the income of that money to be used, pending the provision of a new house, for the housing of the houseless man.<lb/>
The third point in the Bill is a small technical one. If a vicarage house is sold upon which a loan exists&#x2014;that is to say, upon which there is still money owing which has been borrowed for the improvement or for the repair of that house&#x2014;the loan must, by the existing law, be allowed to run, and is not allowed to be paid off. Consequently there is great confusion of accounts, and great difficulty both to the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty and to the incumbent. The points raised in this Bill have been at least once previously before your Lordships' House, and have passed without question. The matter has been most carefully considered by a committee of Queen Anne's Bounty who went into all the technicalities, and there is, so far as I am aware, no difference of opinion on the subject among those best informed. I ask your Lordships in these circumstances to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SMALL DWELLING-HOUSES IN BURGHS<lb/> LETTING (SCOTLAND) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02168" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02169">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02170"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill to which I am going to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading is a Bill devised for the purpose of meeting two grievances which have been mentioned very frequently in Parliament in previous years, and which exist in some of the burghs and particularly in some of the larger burghs of Scotland. One of them is that which is known as letting houses by means of "missives." That being explained is this. In the month of January, or thereabouts, it has for a long time been the custom of house factors and house owners to issue to tenants of houses what is called a missive, which the tenant is required to sign and return. The purport of it is that the tenant undertakes to take the house for a year from the Whitsunday following the January in which the missive is sent to him. Your Lordships will at once see that for a labourer, whose employment may be intermittent, to be required to take a house practically for fifteen months to come without any certainty that his employment will last during that time is <i>prima facie</i> a hardship. The hardship is not so great in the smaller towns, where, as a rule, the various kinds of employment are much the same in quantity, and persons live in the same houses, generally speaking, for a considerable time. Where the grievance has been mostly felt is in large towns, especially in the City of Glasgow and in other towns where shipbuilding is the principal occupation, because shipbuilding varies very greatly indeed from time to time, and if your Lordships take the last two years you will see in what a very bad state that business has been.<lb/>
This Bill, so far as the letting of small dwelling-houses in Scotland is concerned &#x2014;and this is the only subject except that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0505"/>
<col>959</col>
of hypothec with which the Bill deals&#x2014;is precisely in the same terms as the measure which was before your Lordships' House last year. The Bill proposes to deal with this matter in this way. Clause 2 defines as a "small dwelling-house" a house entered on the valuation roll at a yearly rent of &#x00A3;10 or under in a burgh of under 20,000 population; of &#x00A3;15 in burghs up to 50,000; and &#x00A3;21 in burghs over 50,000 population. I do not think it is necessary to go at length into those figures, because they were largely discussed, and I believe agreed upon, at the end of the last session of Parliament. Then the Bill provides in Clause 4 that no agreement, whether verbal or written, for the let of a small dwelling-house shall be binding if the same has been made more than two months prior to the commencement of such let. Then the Bill continues, in Clause 6, to say that at certain dates which are given cither the owner or the occupier is to have a right to terminate the tenancy. By Clause 9, if an occupier of a small dwelling-house is in arrear with his rent for a period of seven days the owner is entitled to give him forty-eight hours' notice of removal. And then in Clause 13 there is a provision that, where the population of the burgh does not exceed 10,000, this Bill is not to come into force in that burgh until it has been adopted by resolution of the town council. That is the whole part of the Bill which relates to the letting of small dwelling-houses.<lb/>
This Bill, of course, has been given very careful consideration by a variety of the public authorities concerned, and especially by those authorities who will, if this Bill becomes law, become the authorities to administer the law. I may say that the Bill, which is in large part due to the efforts and the legal knowledge of Mr. Scott Dickson and Mr. Clyde, has been approved, first of all, by the Parliamentary Committee of the City of Glasgow by a very large majority&#x2014;by thirteen to two&#x2014;as the proper way of dealing with this business. It was confirmed by the Glasgow Corporation, and, out of the whole body of eighty, only five voted against it. It has been approved by the Convention of Royal Burghs, from whom I have presented a Petition to the House; and it has also been approved by the Association of Burgh Officials, a body of men who, of necessity, take great interest in this proposal. The one or two smaller burghs
<col>960</col>
which have considered the Bill themselves have approved of it. I have presented to your Lordships a Petition from the Burgh of Partick, and the words used in their Petition convey so completely the contents of this measure that perhaps your Lordships will allow me to read them. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The main purpose of this Bill is to remove the grievance presently complained of by occupiers, that missives of let of small dwelling-houses are issued by owners and factors to occupiers early in each year and the return of such missives is demanded several months before the following term of Whitsunday. Your Petitioners are satisfied that the said Bill, which does not raise any difficulties as to rating and franchise, will effectually deal with the objections to the present missive system, and be of great public utility if passed into law."</quote>
I cannot use any stronger words than those, or words which will explain more clearly what I believe this Bill contains.<lb/>
There is another matter&#x2014;a comparatively small one&#x2014;which is dealt with in the Bill, and that is what is known as the right of urban hypothec&#x2014;the right which a landlord in Scotland has to sell up the goods of a very small tenant. Your Lordships will see, in Clause 12, how that matter is dealt with. The Clause runs&#x2014;
<quote>"All bedding material as well as all tools and implements of trade used or to be used by the occupier of a small dwelling-house or any member of his family, as the means of his, her, or their livelihood, which are in the dwelling-house, and furniture and plenishing in a small dwelling-house to the value according to the sheriff officer's inventory, of <i>ten pounds</i>, shall be wholly exempt from the right of hypothec of the landlord."</quote>
This right of hypothec was abolished in the case of the country a good many years ago, and in reality, if you look into the matter, there were better reasons for retaining this right of hypothec in that case than there is in the case of urban districts. This Bill proposes, as has often been proposed before, to abolish that hypothec. I have now dealt with the contents of the Bill.<lb/>
But perhaps it is right that I should call your Lordships' attention to a matter which is not part of this Bill, but which may be said to be connected with it&#x2014;the collection of rates. During the last year the Corporation of the City of Glasgow tried as an experiment collecting rates at shorter periods than the year, and that experiment has been an enormous success. It has been highly approved of by the ratepayers, and the Corporation itself found it a very convenient system of proceeding.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0506"/>
<col>961</col>
Therefore this matter, too, has been the subject of a good deal of discussion among corporations and others in Scotland, and I shall propose to introduce a Bill into this House legalising the collection of rates at shorter periods than the law at present allows. In Glasgow they claim to have a legal right at the present time to collect rates at shorter periods, but at all events other burghs have not, and I think that that is a matter which ought to be put in the shape of a Bill if for no other reason than that it will enable all the burghs individually to look at it and express their opinion with regard to it. And your Lordships will all agree that the right way of proceeding when you are endeavouring to alter such matters as the system of collecting rates is to work in harmony with the officials who will have hereafter to administer the law and not to introduce proposals of your own without any knowledge of how far those proposals will meet with the general approval of the officials concerned in their administration. I may say that if your Lordships see fit to read this Bill a second time and it makes further progress, I should propose then to stop the Bill until the terms of this second Bill which I have mentioned are finally settled. I should then introduce that Bill into this House, so that your Lordships would have the plan as a whole before you. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02172"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought that some of your Lordships might wish to address to the House some remarks on the proposal of the noble Earl to obtain a Second Reading for this Bill. I confess I hardly think that your Lordships' memory can be so short as must be assumed by the noble Earl who has introduced this Bill. It deals with a subject which was before this House on no less than seven occasions last year, and the noble Earl has, I think, in his introduction of the subject to your Lordships this afternoon, somewhat ignored the real heart of the controversy which made so large an encroachment upon the time of your Lordships last year.<lb/>
The noble Earl proposes to obtain a Second Reading for a Bill which deals
<col>962</col>
with the letting of small dwelling-houses in burghs in Scotland. The history of this question is that since the year 1895 something like nine or ten Private Members' Bills have been introduced in the House of Commons to deal with this question. In 1906 the Government of that day appointed a Committee to inquire into the whole question. No charge was ever made that that Committee was otherwise than a well-constituted, impartial, experienced, and capable body. They inquired into this question at great length, and examined witnesses from various parts of the country, and after their Report had been presented the Government introduced the Bill of last session. The noble Earl's Bill deals with part of the grievance, but it does not attempt to deal with one part of the grievance which I shall mention. It is this. In Scotland, differing from England in this practice, the rating law exacts from working-men such as those to whom the noble Earl alluded, payment of their rates in one annual sum in the winter&#x2014;a time which is the most inconvenient period of the year, when work is slack, if ever during the year it is slack. This is a burden, therefore, which they feel acutely. That was part of the grievance presented to the Committee.<lb/>
The Government, in attempting to frame proposals on this subject, could not ignore that part of the grievance, and they therefore included in their Bill proposals dealing with the rating question in conjunction with their other proposals. The noble Earl has admitted this afternoon, by his announcement that he proposes to introduce a supplementary Bill, the intimate connection between the rating problem and the measure which he has laid before your Lordships to-day; and I confess that it would be much more satisfactory to your Lordships, or to any deliberative assembly, that you should see the whole scheme of the noble Earl before pronouncing upon it. The essence of the difficulty of this question lies in the rating&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02173"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02174"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: All the friction which exists between local authorities, burgh authorities, parish authorities, house factors, owners and tenants&#x2014;the whole of the friction and difficulty comes from the rating problem, and to attempt to deal
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0507"/>
<col>963</col>
with this question without dealing with the rating problem is to court disaster and to create new injustices. The noble Earl, in introducing the Bill, intimated to your Lordships that it owed its existence largely to the efforts of two distinguished Scottish Members of Parliament and lawyers, Mr. Scott-Dickson and Mr. Clyde, and I am glad to think that they have given attention to this question. But, as a matter of fact, with the exception of one clause, which contains the limits of rental and which in those limits differs from the Government Bill, the clauses which this Bill contains are word for word the clauses in the Government Bill of last session so far as they go.<lb/>
The noble Earl went on to enumerate a list of local authorities who had given their support to this Bill. I remember, on one of the earlier occasions when your Lordships discussed this subject last year, the noble Earl announcing to the House a number of authorities who had expressed themselves entirely in favour of the scheme which he then produced; and I shared his disappointment when, on the next occasion, he was obliged to announce that he found there was considerable opposition to the proposals, and he desired to replace them by an entirely new scheme of Amendments. It may be perfectly true&#x2014;I do not doubt it for a moment&#x2014;that the authorities whom the noble Earl has mentioned have expressed themselves in favour of this Bill, but they are all burgh authorities dealing with the burgh rate. They have no responsibility for the collection of the poor rate, which is the largest rate in Scotland and amounts to 38 per cent. of the whole money collected in rates. He leaves out of sight entirely another very important interest in this matter&#x2014;the interest of house-owners. Therefore, out of three large interests, not to speak of the tenants, who must be really the foundation of any scheme of consideration&#x2014;of the three other large interests, namely, the burgh authorities; the parish authorities, who are responsible, as I have said, for two-fifths of the whole rating assessments in Scotland; and the house-owners, the noble Earl can only bring forward evidence&#x2014;and that, I think, not complete evidence&#x2014;from one set of authorities who undoubtedly would be benefited by the provisions in his Bill. And how would they be benefited? They would be benefited because it would be in their power to
<col>964</col>
adopt the provisions of the Burgh Police Act in regard to rates, and so to carry on, as far as their rate is concerned, a system of short lets with a system of short collection of rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02175"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: They have the power now to adopt those clauses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02176"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I know; but they have never exercised it, because it would be a perfectly unworkable system. Surely the experience of years and years must go for something in this matter. Surely, also, the experience of England must go for something. This whole question was considered in England after the Franchise Act of 1868, and Parliament had immediately to set to work, in 1869, and revise what it did in the Franchise Act. The result is that you have in England now a flexible system of collection of rates, and a flexible system of short lets adapted to the needs of modern industry, which require that workmen must be enabled, without real damage to their own interests, to remove from one house to another. Your Lordships, with those facts before you last year, rejected a Bill which came before you with practically the unanimous consent of the Members of the other House representing Scotland.<lb/>
I really cannot understand quite how to deal with the situation which the noble Earl presents to us on this occasion. The Government, and the noble Earl himself, if I may be allowed to say so, during the discussions of last year came under certain obligations to the house-owners. Your Lordships' House, too, came under a certain obligation to the house-owners, who are an interest to be considered in this matter. Though your Lordships were not willing to consider the Government's proposal of an allowance to house-owners, you consented to the justice of house-owners having an allowance if they were obliged to collect the rates. Are you going back upon that? Are you going to accept a scheme which gives no allowance? Or is that to be part of the second Bill which the noble Earl is going to introduce? I hesitate to trouble your Lordships further on this question. The attitude of the Government is quite clear. Their attitude remains as it was as embodied in the Bill which came to your Lordships' House last year with the support of the Scottish Members after they had given it very full consideration,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0508"/>
<col>965</col>
and which in that form, I make bold to say, had a very large measure of support. I think it satisfied, if not completely, yet in its main lines&#x2014;and slight amendment would have been quite possible&#x2014;opinion in Scotland with regard to this question.<lb/>
This is a very intricate question. Your Lordships, I am sure, will believe that nine or ten Private Members' Bills could not be introduced, and that the labours of a competent Committee could not take place without showing evidence that this is a very complicated and difficult question. It was said last year that the Government had some reserved motive, some concealed motive, in bringing this forward; that they wished to tamper with the franchise. I have repeatedly disavowed that statement in this House; and I make bold to say that any Government or any individual&#x2014;the noble Earl himself is an instance of it&#x2014;who takes up this question and cries to deal with it cannot do so without dealing or attempting to deal with the rating problem. We are compelled to deal with it by the necessities of the situation, and the Government gave their best efforts last year to arrive at a solution. The noble Earl brings this forward at a time when, by common consent and by the speeches of the Government itself, it is not possible really to entertain any substantial hopes that this measure can be treated as non-controversial. I am a new member of this House, but I should have thought it was highly unusual to initiate rating legislation in this House. That, however, is not a matter to be determined by myself, and therefore I simply make that remark.<lb/>
But I do regret that, as the noble Earl has seen fit to bring forward this question, he has not brought it forward in a way and with proposals which should put before your Lordships the whole bearings of the case to enable you to form a sound judgment upon it. I do not think I am entitled, considering how much time the House gave to this question last session, to follow the noble Earl into the details which he enumerated of the provisions of his Bill. I will only say that it has been a bitter disappointment to those interested in Scotland who are concerned in this question that your Lordships did not see your way to give a more indulgent consideration last session to the proposals which the Government then laid before you.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02177"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland has reminded your Lordships that this subject was before the House on no less than seven occasions last year, and I am certain that none of us who are interested in this particular question can have forgotten anything about the lengthy discussions which then took place. We must also remember the very great vicissitudes through which the Bill of last year passed both in this House and in another place, and it is now before your Lordships, as to the whole of this Bill, in the same form in which the agreed portion of the Bill of last year eventually emerged from discussion. Although it does not do the whole of what the Government included in their Bill, yet it does carry out the remedying of those great grievances which the Government put forward as the real and main object of the Bill they introduced last year. These grievances have been thoroughly put before your Lordships on this occasion by Lord Camperdown.<lb/>
The Secretary for Scotland, so far as the particular matters of short letting and doing away with the missive are concerned, will realise that this Bill has actually reached all points. The noble Lord shakes his head; but the Bill lays down, in exactly the same form as the Government laid down, remedies for those grievances. The point of controversy does and must arise at the point where this Bill comes to an end. The Secretary for Scotland objects to this Bill, not for anything that is in the Bill, but for what there is not in the Bill. He objects to it because it does not do that which it never ever thought of setting out to do. It is not a rating Bill. It does not alter the system of rating as we have it now in Scotland. Nor is that an essential part of the measure. I do not believe it is in the least bit necessary, purely for the purpose of doing away with certain grievances, to deal with a matter which those grievances themselves do not touch.<lb/>
It is obvious that you cannot alter a system of letting without touching a system of rating. I am prepared to agree that when you alter your system of letting from a long to a short occupation, when you give liberty to a tenant to determine his holding at short notice, varying, I think, from five to forty days, it is convenient and advisable that you should so alter the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0509"/>
<col>967</col>
present annual system of collection in Scotland that it should meet the system of these short lets. I believe it would be advantageous to do so, as the noble Lord himself has told us, because there are many objections to an annual system of rating; but it is quite possible, as the noble Earl in charge of this Bill has shown us, that with the addition of a future rating Bill&#x2014;a perfectly distinct measure from this&#x2014;we may carry out the full object that we have in view. The system of collection at short intervals is, after all, one of the remedies for the difficulties which the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland sees, and it was admitted as a possible remedy when the Government first brought in the Bill last year. Collection at short intervals can be adopted without difficulty in Scotland, and it always has been adopted in England, where rates are collected quarterly or half-yearly, and it has been shown that that system can be carried on with advantage to the collecting authority and to the tenant himself, without dragging in that system of "compounding" which every one of us objects to in theory, and which the noble Lord opposite only brought in because in his opinion there is no other way of getting over the difficulty. I do not desire to enter into a discussion upon the theoretical or actual merits of compounding now. When the other promised Bill comes before your Lordships it will be necessary to speak on the subject. But the compounding which the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland himself so much prefers for the particular objects of this Bill has been shown in England to be really not necessary to those objects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02178"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after what has fallen from the noble Earl who moved the Second Reading of the Bill and from my noble friend behind me, it is unnecessary for me to occupy more than a couple of minutes of your Lordships' time. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland took objection to this Bill because it did not contain the rating clauses of last year's Bill, and he quoted to us the English Acts of 1868 and 1869, under which compounding was first done away with and then re-introduced. But since then the Royal Commission on Local Taxation and the Royal Commission on the Poor Law have both expressed complete disapproval of compounding of rates in England. They object to a man having a vote in the financial expenditure of his
<col>968</col>
district without any direct responsibility. I think that clearly deals with the whole of the objections of the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland in regard to that part of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02179"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure that when I listened to the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland I felt quite certain whether he desired to resist the Second Reading of this Bill or not. I hope he will not resist the Second Reading. I think it is a much more usual course in your Lordships' House that a Bill which in the main seems to deserve the consent of the House should be given a Second Reading. Its subsequent fate, of course, must depend on other circumstances. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland spoke in a vague way of the friction which might arise if this Bill were passed without the additional provisions which His Majesty's Government think ought to have been inserted. He did not explain to us exactly how that friction would arise. As far as I understood him, the clauses as they stand have his approval, but he thinks they are dangerous without other clauses which he did not specially particularise. I suppose he referred to the clauses which were in the Bill of last year, but he did not explain to us why the passage of this Bill without those other clauses should cause the friction of which he spoke. It appears that my noble friend and those with whom he acts are proposing to deal with the other matters, to some extent at any rate, in another Bill. What objection can there be to dealing with a complicated subject in two Bills rather than in one? Personally I have always preferred that method of dealing with legislation, and I think the Government themselves would be well advised to accept part of their proposals if those proposals are put forward separately, and then go on with the other parts which are more controversial hereafter. Moreover, there was a certain inconsistency in the noble Lord's attitude. One of the complaints he made was that your Lordships were initiating what he called a rating Bill. Surely, it hardly lay in his mouth to complain that there were not more rating clauses in the Bill! In these circumstances I venture to- hope that your Lordships will agree to the Second Reading, and then we can consider further what possibility there may be of passing the Bill through its subsequent stages.</membercontribution></p>

Now the Bill before the House is a Small Dwelling-Houses in Burghs Letting (Scotland) Bill. There is nothing about rating in it. Then the noble Lord left this Bill and proceeded to talk about the Bill of last year, and to go into matters with which the particular Bill which your Lordships are now asked to read a second time has nothing in the world to do. What the noble Lord said was this, that nearly the whole of the difficulty comes from the rating question.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02183"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord says "Hear, hear." Does he mean to say, then, that he has no objection to the missive system? Has that nothing to do with the difficulty? Let him do me the honour of reading the Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"No agreement &#x2026;for the let of a small dwelling-house shall be binding if the same has been made more than two months prior to the commencement of such let."</quote>
What is the grievance of these missives? Does not the Bill meet that grievance? Then the noble Lord says this Bill creates a new injustice. I should like to know what that new injustice is. "Creating a new injustice" is one of those round phrases which are so easy to use, and which the noble Lord, if I may say so, is so fond of using in this House. He uses words to which one really cannot attach any particular meaning. I should like to know what new injustice this Bill creates. I do not know of any. I have pointed out that it undoubtedly does away with two grievances. It does away with the grievance of missives; it does away with the grievance of urban hypothec. I wish the noble Lord could point out to me where this new grievance comes in. At all events, he will have an opportunity in Committee of pointing it out to me. The noble Lord has developed a new and sudden affection for the house-owners. He asks, "What will they say?" After we
<col>970</col>
have read this Bill a second time we shall know what they say; but, as a matter of fact, I know that they have been considering this Bill in consultation with various of these authorities, and if they wish to say that some of the arrangements proposed in the Bill are not fair they will have an opportunity. The noble Lord talked a great deal about rating, and about his Bill of last year. He described that Bill as a Government Bill. As a matter of fact, it was Mr. Cross's Bill. It was not a Government Bill at all, but, Mr. Cross's Bill which the Government subsequently took up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02184"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is able to refer to the record.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02185"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I have not the record here. I have only my own recollection, and I was asking the noble Lord whether his recollection agrees with mine. The Bill was Mr. Cross's Bill and not a Government Bill. I am bound to say that when one says that, it recalls the fact that this Government have been in the habit of indulging in a practice which is very inconvenient. They more than once have taken up a private Bill which has gone through the other House, at all events through several of its stages, as a private. Bill, and then they call it a Government Bill. I do not know what the motives of the Government are. The noble Lord said something about their motives being suspected. I merely take their speeches, and I will tell the noble Lord exactly how I construe his speech. He wants to wound, but he is afraid to strike. He does not want to deal with this grievance, but to appeal to a proposal which was inserted in the other House, not by the Government, not in pursuance of the recommendation of Lord Guthrie's Committee, but which was suggested by the Labour Members as&#x2014;it was frankly stated so&#x2014;a means of working round the franchise legislation of the country. From the noble Lord's speech I should say he did not care in the least about this missive grievance, which is the real grievance. He says you cannot deal with it unless you deal also with rating. Why not? Pass this Bill by itself and you will have done away with missive and with hypothec. Those are all the words I need trouble your Lordships with at this stage. I shall, of course, give reasonable time before taking the Committee stage, in order that we may

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02189"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a very simple measure to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading. It makes a slight alteration in the case of pensions as regards constables who come under Section 1 (<i>b</i>) of the principal Act, <i>i.e.</i>, retiring under medical certificate as having been incapacitated for duty by infirmity of mind or body, after twenty years approved service. At present such cases come under the general scale, Part I. of First Schedule to the principal Act, <i>i.e.</i>, if over twenty and under twenty-one years approved service, an annual sum equal to twenty-sixtieths of annual pay is given them; if completed twenty-one and under twenty-eight years approved service, an annual sum equal to twenty-sixtieths of annual pay, plus one-sixtieth for every year over twenty years; if completed twenty-eight years approved service, an annual sum equal to twenty-eight-sixtieths of annual pay, plus two-sixtieths for every year over twenty-eight years, but not to exceed two-thirds of annual pay.<lb/>
What is proposed in this Bill is in cases under Section 1 (<i>b</i>) of the principal Act&#x2014;that is, cases of constables retiring under medical certificate as having been incapacitated for duty by infirmity of mind or body&#x2014;to substitute, in those cases and in those cases only, the following provision: if completed twenty-one years or over approved service, an annual sum equal to twenty-sixtieths of annual pay, plus two-sixtieths for every year over twenty years, but not to exceed two-thirds of annual pay. This change is of a very limited character and it applies only to a limited class, and even after this Bill has been accepted the position of constables in Scotland will be less favourable than that of constables in England and Wales under the English Police Act of 1890, 53 and 54 Vict., c. 45, s. 1 and First Schedule.<lb/>
<col>972</col>
Besides the slight amendment in the scale of pension, the Bill proposes to embody several sections of the English Police (Superannuation) Act of 1906. Clause 6 of this Bill (Pensions to constables continuing to serve after qualification for pension), Clause 7 (Reckoning of discontinuous service as approved service for pension), Clause 8 (Reckoning of approved service in different forces), Clause 9(Approved service in case of Naval and Army Reservists), Clause 10 (Amendment of 53 and 54 Vict., c. 67, as to forfeiture of pensions), Clause 13 (Age of compulsory retirement), Clause 14 (Amendment of Section 4 of principal Act)&#x2014;all these are clauses which you will find in the English Act of 1906, and as they have been accepted for England and worked well, it is desirable that the Scottish legislation should be assimilated.<lb/>
There only remain Clauses 11 and 12. Clause 11 makes a change in the age of appointment and transfer. It extends the age limit for transferred persons, which is intended mainly for special cases and to prevent undue hampering of efficiency by too strict a limit. Clause 12 relates to the investment of the pension fund. I believe my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland has no objection to this Bill, which comes from another place as an agreed Bill, and therefore it is with confidence that I ask your Lordships to give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02193"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call your Lordships' attention to the state and to the musketry training of the Territorial Army according to the Return [Cd. 5018] of April, 1910, and to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0512"/>
<col>973</col>
<ol>
<li>1. If a period of embodiment for training after mobilisation is still considered as an essential feature of the scheme of the Territorial Army, <i>vide</i> Army Memorandum on the Military Forces of the United Kingdom dated 27th February, 1907, or if the Territorial Army is now considered fit for active service at Home at any moment without any such period of embodied training.</li>
<li>2. If some Territorial Infantry battalions during the present summer could devote their fifteen days of training to firing the annual musketry course prescribed by Regulations for a Line battalion.</li>
<li>3. If His Majesty's Government are satisfied that the Territorial Force is prepared to undertake prolonged embodied service in the United Kingdom during the absence of the Regular Army.</li>
</ol>
The state of the Territorial Army by the Return of April last was as follows. It was 1,488 officers and 32,138 men deficient from an establishment which we must remember the Government, who are responsible for our national security, have told us was the minimum consistent with safety, that establishment being 11,214 officers and 301,363 non-commissioned officers and men. On October 1 last there were 98,306 men under twenty years of age. The ages are only recorded on the 1st of October of each year. It would be accurate to say that in the Territorial Army there would always be 100,000 boys under twenty years of age, some of whom are seventeen years old and many still younger. There are 53,600 men serving on a one-year engagement. These are men who transferred from the old Volunteer Force but would not accept the four year term of engagement, but being in a position to do so, preferred to dictate their own conditions of service to the Army Council. Last year 163,000 men attended camp for fifteen days and some for less periods, but 1,520 officers did not attend camp at all, and 21,980 men followed their example and stayed absent. Such is the state of the Territorial Army according to the Return in April which we have before us.<lb/>
Now as to its duties. I ask the Government if they are satisfied that the Force, as at present constituted and in its present condition, can be relied upon to fulfil its <i>r&#x00F4;le</i> in time of war. The Force has now been in existence some four years, so
<col>974</col>
possibly the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War will not tell me that my inquiry is premature and that it would be more discreet to "wait and see." We were informed in an Army Memorandum on the Military Forces of the United Kingdom, signed by the Secretary of State for War and dated February 27th, 1907, that&#x2014;
<quote>"It, is an essential feature of the scheme that a period of embodiment for training after mobilisation will be necessary before the Territorial Force can be regarded as fit to meet a highly trained and organised enemy."</quote>
Exactly a year after&#x2014;in February, 1908&#x2014;the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War, in an able and exhaustive paper on the work of County Associations, defined the duties of the Territorial Army as follow&#x2014;
<quote>"In the first place it accepts the whole responsibility for home defence, and in the second place, if there is need for expansion of the Forces in the field, it is asked to volunteer in companies or even in whole units for service at the front."</quote>
Both statements assume that a period of embodied training is necessary before the Territorial Army can become fit for service. But this essential feature, subsequently known as the six months of close time, appears to hold good now of the Territorial Artillery only. For field service at home the Territorial Artillery have no horses and no ammunition with their guns. No General Staff, when faced by the realities of war, would do anything so utterly futile as to waste time and labour in transporting ammunition to field guns which they knew and had known for years before would never have any horses. It is certain, therefore, that the Territorial Artillery cannot be mobilised to meet a raid which must be sudden and must be unexpected. When the raid arrives the <i>r&#x00F4;le</i> of the Territorial Artillery must be to remain at home and not block up the roads and railways&#x2014;in short, to keep out of the way till peace is restored. It is now quite apparent that if the Territorial Artillery is to be of any real value on embodiment they would require now at once and continuously before mobilisation horses, stores for ammunition with their guns, ranges, and a more numerous Permanent Staff of Regular officers and non-commissioned officers. The horses are not, and the Regular officers and non-commissioned officers are not. The ranges are not, and the stores for ammunition with the guns are not. The fact is that nothing short of a large, an
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0513"/>
<col>975</col>
immediate, and a continuous expenditure of money can make the Territorial Artillery of any value for field service at home within any reasonable time from the date of first embodiment.<lb/>
Three courses seem open to the Government: First, to recognise their experiment of Territorial Field Artillery as a failure and to abolish that branch of the Force; secondly, to embark upon a large expenditure of money with a view to making the Territorial Field Artillery efficient within a short time after mobilisation; thirdly, to leave the Territorial Artillery in its present state of inefficiency. Now as regards the last course, the one which will probably be followed, we must remember that Sir John French considers the use of the Territorial Artillery to be to supply drafts of men to the Regular Artillery during the progress of a campaign abroad&#x2014;that and nothing more. But if this is the part, and a very useful one, which they are to play in time of war, then I think it should be explained to the men. It is the same old story of enlisting men for one service and then asking them, under circumstances when a refusal is impossible, to volunteer for another.<lb/>
With the Infantry the essential feature of the six months close time was laid down by the Secretary of State in 1907. In November, 1908, it was definitely abandoned by the right hon. gentleman when he told us at Cambridge that&#x2014;
<quote>"A swiftly moving central force, consisting of Regulars and Territorials in combination, is held in readiness to meet any invasion."</quote>
The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War explained to us in the House last July that Territorial Infantry recruits of seventeen, who have never completed a trained soldier's course of musketry but have only once in their lives discharged twenty rounds of ball ammunition, would take their places in the firing line of Territorial battalions forming part of this swiftly moving central force designed by the Army Council to crush the raiders. The point of age is of some importance. As you are aware, twenty is the minimum age for field service abroad, but now we see that in event of active service at home the Army Council accept seventeen years and less as sufficient. I have the greatest respect for the opinion of the Army Council, but I do not believe that boys of seventeen, whose average weight is less than 130 lbs.,
<col>976</col>
can carry a kit of 60 lbs. on service, It is contrary to common sense to say that they can, and there are 100,000 boys of less than twenty years of age in the Territorial Army. No Continental Power begins to train its recruits until they are twenty years old. It is certain that in no invading force will there be any men who are not well over twenty-two years of age.<lb/>
As to the musketry efficiency of the Territorial Army, much useful information about this point is contained in the Return of April last. The musketry training of the men in the Territorial Army must largely depend upon the musketry efficiency of their officers. We have no information upon the musketry training of officers in the present Return, although I did ask for it in the first instance. The latest information is that in the Return of last July. There were then 674 officers who had never fired a recruit's course of musketry, and 1,805 officers who had fired the recruit's course but had not fired the trained soldier's course. That is to say, one quarter of the officers then serving were not trained in musketry. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for War could say whether he is satisfied with the progress made in the musketry training of the officers of the Territorial Army since last year. As regards men, full information is given in the April Return. The number of recruits who failed to qualify in musketry last year was 39,267. Let me add that the standard which must be attained by recruits before firing a trained soldier's course has recently been lowered. Up to April, 1910, a recruit had to obtain hits of a certain value. If he failed to do so, then he had to make a second visit to the range, and after discharging a certain number of rounds of ball ammunition, with every one of which he may miss the mark, he became thereby qualified to be returned as a Territorial soldier trained in musketry. But this meant a second visit to the range, and the man could not be got to the range a second time. So now by lowering the value of the hits necessary to be obtained, and making the lower standard retrospective, a lot of recruits who had failed to qualify when this Return was issued will in any future Returns be classed as trained soldiers, and that without necessitating a second visit to the range. In addition to recruits not qualified, there must be on the strength
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0514"/>
<col>977</col>
of every Force recently-joined recruits who have never fired at all. I presume these are included in the Returns in the number of 35,456 who are mentioned as "never having been tested." As regards trained men who have been tested, 25,570 have failed to qualify, which means that they refuse to make a second attendance on the range for the purpose of discharging the necessary number of rounds. As a result we find that, out of 269,000 men now serving, in round numbers 100,000 men have either failed to qualify in musketry or have not fired at all.<lb/>
The trained Territorial soldier's course is twenty-three rounds a year, which can be easily fired in an hour. No man is of any fighting value with his rifle in the field unless he has some idea of judging distance. In the Territorial Army there is little if any judging distance practice. Men who have never been taught to notice the varying appearance of objects under different conditions of atmosphere, and townsmen to whom the features of the country are wholly unfamiliar and who do not know if an object is 200 or 400, 500 or 1,000 yards away, whose annual training on the range, and that not always carried out, is the discharge of twenty-three rounds of ball ammunition, are to meet and are expected by the Army Council to defeat the highly-trained rifle shots of a Continental Army. I do not for my own part believe that the trained Territorial soldier whose annual musketry course is one hour when he fires twenty-three rounds, and who is not taught to judge distance, would be of any more value as a marksman in the day of battle than the recruit who has once fired twenty rounds. Again, from my own experience, I am confident that the recruit who has once fired his twenty rounds is of no more value than a man who has never fired at all, and that is precisely the value of the mass of 169,000 so-called trained Territorial soldiers as riflemen in action at the present moment. It is just as reasonable to assume that a military Power would do anything so foolish as to take the risk and the trouble of landing an Infantry force in this country containing a big percentage of one-legged men as to assume that they will bring over a force containing many men whom they know to be useless as rifle shots. No wonder, then, that General Sir Henry Brackenbury, who has an intimate knowledge of our Army and of the
<col>978</col>
Armies of the Continental Powers, and who, fortunately, is in a position to express an entirely independent opinion, wrote last January as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not doubt the spirit that actuates the officers and men of the Territorial Army, but I say, with Lord Roberts and Colonel Lonsdale Hale, that it is, through no fault of its own, utterly unfit for the task that would be imposed upon it, and I hold that it would be little short of murder to put those untrained men and inexperienced officers into the field against a skilled army."</quote>
We have been told in your Lordships' House before Easter that seven battalions did not fire this annual course of twenty-three rounds last year.<lb/>
What, then, is it that has paralysed the Territorial Army in its musketry training? I read in the Regulations of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Inspecting Officers are to forward for the final decision of the General Officer Commanding a statement saying if any part of a grant should be withheld on the score of non- efficiency in any unit."</quote>
This particular Regulation raises the point of how can untrained men and the untrained battalions mentioned by the Under-Secretary of State for War, who have not fired this year, be returned as efficient and so earn their grant, because if they do not get their grant by hook or by crook, it means the collapse of the seven battalions, and that is a serious matter for all concerned&#x2014;I mean for the battalions and for the Staff and for the Inspecting Officer and for the authors of the scheme of the new model Army. The answer to this perplexing question seems to be that although you cannot return these battalions as efficient in musketry, yet you can return them as qualified. But qualified to do what? Well, qualified to earn the grant, of course. They are not wanted to be qualified to do anything else. The War Office letter dated April 14 substitutes "qualified" for "efficient," and as a despairing effort to twist the meaning of the King's English it is, I think, worthy of quotation. It runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The terms 'efficient' and 'qualified,' as applied to the Territorial Force, have recently been the subject of consideration. It is thought that the term 'efficient' is somewhat anomalous and misleading, and seeing that it is not used in its true sense in the Regulations for the Territorial Force, but is generally intended to convey the meaning of qualification for the purpose of earning financial grants, travelling expenses, ammunition, and other allowances, it has been decided to substitute for it the term 'qualified' in the new revise of these Regulations. The word 'efficient' will, therefore,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0515"/>
<col>979</col>
where it occurs in the revised Territorial Force Regulations, only be interpreted in its true literal meaning. As, however, the term 'qualified' will be utilised for the purpose of earning grants and allowances it will be necessary to eliminate from Musketry Regulations, Part I, the term in so far as it applies to 'qualification' in the Standard Tests. So far as musketry is concerned, 'qualified' will, therefore, imply that the conditions for obtaining travelling allowance and for expenditure of ammunition have been complied with, while ' passed ' will mean the passing of the Standard Tests."</quote>
We are told that these seven battalions have missed going to the range through no fault of their own. The General Officers are satisfied that this complete omission of musketry training was not wilful, but due to circumstances over which they have no control; and so it comes to pass that these men are returned as qualified to draw their efficiency grant as though they were skilled marksmen and everyone will be pleased and contented, and the story will end happily for all concerned. But I am not quite sure if that will be the case. At least, if it is some of the Territorial battalions are a long-suffering lot. Because I read in <i>The Times</i> newspaper of April 12&#x2014;
<quote>"Summons against Territorial soldiers. At Bromley (Kent) Petty Sessions yesterday a number of members of the Territorial Force were summoned for failing to fulfil the conditions of annual training in the 5th Battalion Royal West Kent Regiment. By failing to attend the prescribed drills, camp, and musketry practice the defendants had lost to the County Association the Government grant per man towards clothing of twenty-three shillings. These being the first summonses against the defendants, the Bench imposed only a fine equal to the amount of the grant lost by the Association."</quote>
Why are these men of Kent brought before the local authority and made to pay up 23<i>s</i>. as inefficient, when the men of seven other Battalions are all excused and described as officially qualified to draw the grant though never having fired at all?<lb/>
In connection with this point of drawing grants for efficiency, we see that there are 21,980 men who never attended camp, and that there are 25,570 men who failed to qualify in musketry. These are not separate headings; I mean that in the number of men who never attended camp are no doubt included some men who have not qualified in musketry, and <i>vice versa</i>. The question I ask is, How long do you mean to retain on the strength of the Territorial Army and return as efficient for the purposes of drawing grants, a man
<col>980</col>
not qualified in musketry and a man who never attends camp, and men who fail to do both? These men would no doubt welcome discharge from the Territorial Force, but without having to pay the necessary &#x00A3;5 for their freedom. The County Association has the power to discharge such men under Paragraph 95 of the Territorial Force Regulations as "not likely to become an efficient soldier." But if you discharge them, either they get off scot free, or possibly by paying fines which in the aggregate are far less than the &#x00A3;5 necessary to purchase their discharge. If you retain them&#x2014;and this seems to have been done pretty freely from the number at present in the Force&#x2014;they certainly ought not to be considered as effectives. I suggest that they should be retained on the strength, because I do not see how they can be discharged and so allowed to escape paying the &#x00A3;5 penalty, but they should be shown as men not trained. They would always remain liable for embodied service, when they would, whether they liked it or not, be compelled to serve and train. In the days of the Volunteer Force, if a Volunteer did not fire he did not earn the Government grant. He was returned as non-efficient, and the total number of non-efficient Volunteers always appeared in the Army Annual Return, and there was an end of the matter.<lb/>
We were told when the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act was passed that there would be an end of all old Volunteer shams. We were told also that a system of payment by results would be established, and that thus efficiency would be ensured. No General Officer Commanding would sanction the expenditure of sixpence of public money upon an untrained or inefficient unit. We were deeply impressed with the prospect of maintaining this rigid standard of efficiency, which has resulted in the Army Council expunging the word "efficient" from the revised Territorial Force Musketry Regulations. There was far less sham about the Volunteer musketry of the past than there is about that of the Territorial Army of to-day. Yet the Volunteers were more numerous than the Territorials, and the ranges were fewer. Why then were there no cases of whole battalions not firing a shot on the rifle range and requiring a special order to allow them to draw Government grants when they had not fired? The reason is not far to seek. Target practice on the range&#x2014;that was,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0516"/>
<col>981</col>
bullseye shooting&#x2014;was a popular pastime with the Volunteers. It was the rifle range and rifle meetings which inspired the old Volunteer movement. It is the summer camp, now at some great training centre, now at some pleasant seaside resort, with its pay and its allowances and its pastimes, which appeals to the Territorial soldier. Distinguished persons, civil and military, visit these great summer camps and deliver soul-stirring orations; the Press chronicles the daily exploits of the Territorial Army on man&#x0153;uvres, and so on and so forth. None of these distinguished persons, to whom we confide our national security, go to see the musketry practice of the Territorial Army, nor do they attach the least importance to it. When, however, the matter is forced upon their attention&#x2014;and there was some discussion upon it in the House before Easter&#x2014;they dispose of all difficulties by lowering the standard of recruit qualification, making that lower standard retrospective, and changing the term "efficient" for that of "qualified," measures which I quite see will make the next musketry return of the Territorial Army read very differently from the present one. In the next return there will be a sudden accession of efficiency, and that without inflicting live minutes more training on any member of the Force.<lb/>
The fact that the musketry of the Territorial Force is in such an unsatisfactory condition, and the fact that rifle shooting under present service conditions on the range is so unpopular with the men that they simply will not do it&#x2014;witness the thousands not trained&#x2014;demands an inquiry into the whole subject. But as I am not hopeful of obtaining any searching and independent inquiry&#x2014;and to an inquiry by Departmental Committee I attach no value&#x2014;I make the following suggestion. It is this, that during this summer, instead of going to man&#x0153;uvres, let as many Territorial battalions as possible be put through the musketry course of the Line under the supervision of the Musketry Staff of the Regular Army. The results of firing by the Territorial battalions of the Regular Army musketry course should be published in comparison with those of the Line. Then, but not till then, the country will know what kind of riflemen the mass of the Territorial Infantry really are as compared with trained soldiers, and it is against the very best of trained soldiers that the Territorial Infantry is to be matched, not against
<col>982</col>
men with bows and arrows. The test I suggest is easy and simple, and it will reveal the truth. There is no mistake about that. Is it not better to learn the truth, however disagreeable, in time of peace, than have it taught to us in time of war? The annual musketry course of the Line takes twelve days, so that the fifteen days' camp of a Territorial battalion will be ample time for the purpose.<lb/>
The second duty which must devolve upon the Territorial Army in time of war is that of prolonged embodied service when the Regular Army is abroad. The Territorial Force has, of course, inherited, and to a great extent carries on, the traditions of the Volunteers. Now there was no tradition in the Volunteer Force of permanent service. It was a form of service the Volunteers had never contemplated, and consequently had never undertaken to render. The dominant idea of the Volunteer Force lad always been a sudden call to arms, followed at once by a brief and thrilling campaign concluded in a few weeks, during which all civil business in the country would have given way to military considerations. That is a very different form of service from a year or so of dull garrison duty, causing prolonged absence from home, and entailing great loss of employment and private means. We know that the Volunteers, when asked during the South African war, could not give even two months of consecutive service on account of their civilian employments. As far as I can ascertain from members of the Territorial Force with whom I have discussed the point, they look on embodied service as just as impossible now, alike for officers and men, in the Territorial Army as it was for the Volunteers. Before the passing of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act it was open to the Government, with the sanction of Parliament, to call out the Army Reserve in the first place, to embody the Militia in the second place, and then to consider what should be done in reference to the third line, the Volunteers. Now by the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act the moment the whole of the Regular Reserve are called out the Territorial Army is automatically embodied. This will be a great hindrance in the future to calling out the Regular Reserve owing to the apprehension throughout the country of dislocation of business entailed by embodying the Territorial Army. If the Territorial
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0517"/>
<col>983</col>
Army had been in the past as they now are, our only second line, they would have been embodied five times in the last fifty-five years, and on not one of these occasions was there any question of attack upon our shores by a naval Power. It is not a question of what the Army Council think that the Territorial Army ought to do, but what the Territorial Force honestly consider they can undertake to do. It is certain that inability on the part of our second line to give permanent service means the breakdown of the whole of the new military machine. The Regular Army would be confined indefinitely to home defence, and all power of offensive action overseas lost. I therefore ask the Under-Secretary of State for War if he can give us any information upon this point, the ability of the Territorial Army to render embodied service, which I presume has been discussed by the Army Council with members of the Territorial Force.<lb/>
The third duty expected from the Territorial Army will be to find drafts for foreign service, and that they should do so is no new suggestion. As long ago as July, 1906, the Secretary of State for War said&#x2014;
<quote>"Some of them (the Volunteers or Territorial Army) would have to form that big national reserve out of which an army must be fed and expanded when the great emergencies come in a national crisis."</quote>
The Inspector-General of the Forces, Sir John French, has told us&#x2014;
<quote>"The second line has to meet the waste of war, and to furnish reinforcements after the war has gone on for some time."</quote>
This year definite effect has been given to this policy by the creation of a Reserve, and by asking officers and men of the Territorial Army to accept the liability for foreign service on mobilisation, and to be distinguished from their comrades by wearing a metal badge. The number who have accepted the liability, according to the statement of the Secretary of State for War on April 16, is 624 officers and 9,721 men. We have been informed by the Secretary of State for War that men from a Territorial Force Reserve would fill the places of those going abroad in drafts to the Regular Army. We were told a year ago by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War, that a Reserve for the Territorial Army was in process of formation. On May 23 last an Army Memorandum appeared containing
<col>984</col>
provisional regulations for that newest and latest branch of our Forces. The establishment is to be 100,000. The Memorandum divides this new Reserve into three branches&#x2014;the Territorial Force Reserve, the Technical Reserve, and the Veteran Reserve. They are the most recent hatch of new forces by the Army Council. The Memorandum proceeds to define the attitude of the Army Council towards cadet corps and rifle clubs.<lb/>
When the Government decided, for various reasons, not to allow any expenditure of public money upon cadet corps and not to allow them to form any part of the Territorial Army scheme, they, in my humble opinion, knocked the bottom out of the whole of their plan for a national Army. They now assume a benevolent attitude towards cadet corps, but one strictly limited to the expression of good wishes and without any prospect of provision of that financial assistance which is so essential. They regard rifle clubs with some suspicion as likely to be prejudicial to the interest of the Territorial Army&#x2014;that is, I presume, to interfere with recruiting for that Force. No doubt men who like rifle shooting as a pastime will join rifle clubs in preference to the Territorial Army. There is a third body of a non-military character which has just made its appearance, and which appeals, I venture to think, most deservedly to the generosity of the public&#x2014;namely, the boy scouts. His Majesty's Government can hardly expect in the present circumstances that persons supporting financially rifle clubs, cadet corps, and boy scouts, will in addition pour money into the laps of the County Associations for the Territorial Army.<lb/>
The Territorial soldier on passing to the Territorial Force Reserve never need do any more military training of any sort or kind during his period of Reserve service which is limited to four years. He may, however, if he thinks a change of scene will do him good, attend a pleasant seaside camp and draw full pay and allowances and enjoy the advantages of sea bathing. If the weather is not favourable for that pastime, or if he gets bored or dislikes his commanding officer in camp, he is free to go home at any moment he wishes. He must be recommended by his commanding officer for transfer to the Reserve, and he must have had four years service. There
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0518"/>
<col>985</col>
is no qualification as regards musketry. The reason can easily be seen. I have described with considerable detail the standard of efficiency in musketry training required by the Army Council from the men serving with the colours in the Territorial Army. Now as that standard for the purpose of a firing line in action opposed to the men of a Regular Army may be correctly represented by zero, the men in the Territorial Reserve are not likely to fall far behind it, and consequently need not be trained at all. The Army Council recognise this point, because they do not allow the men of the Territorial Force Reserve to have any rifles of their own. They share rifles with the men serving with the colours&#x2014;an admirable arrangement in time of peace, but a little inconvenient when the men in the foreign service section, whose places the Reservists are to fill, go abroad and take their rifles with them. I suppose that the Territorial Reservist will then find some gun of his own. We know that in the mounted branches an essential feature of the mobilisation of the Territorial Army is that several men are to ride one horse, I presume in turns. The Army Council extend this principle to the Infantry, and we now come to several men shooting with one rifle in turns.<lb/>
It was inevitable from the moment the Militia was abolished and the Territorial Army put in its place that these questions of embodied service, of foreign service, and of supplying drafts to the Regular Army overseas should arise. They were very clearly foreshadowed by the Secretary of State for War, and cannot come as a surprise to the Territorial Force. The Government consider their new reorganisation on two lines an unqualified success. If it is so, then they must mean to use the Territorial Army for the duties I have mentioned. Well, if they mean this, why not tell us that this is their intention? It will be interesting to see what the Territorial Army thinks of such an announcement. I beg to ask the Questions standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02194"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we on our side cannot complain of any lack of interest in the progress of the Territorial Force, especially on the part of the noble Duke. Perhaps he will allow me to say that his interest is somewhat
<col>986</col>
spasmodic, because a large part of his speech was devoted to asking the same questions and dealing with the very topics which we discussed, and, I venture to say, answered in a debate which took place in this House only a couple of months ago, dealing with the whole question of musketry. My complaint against the noble Duke, so far as I have any complaint at all, is that he displays a certain amount of impatience, and is too fond of pulling up the plant by the roots to see how it is growing. I think, perhaps, in his impatience he has lost count of time. He says that the Territorial Force has been in existence four years, but I would remind him that it has only been in existence just over two-years; and when he proceeds to make deductions from the state of the Force last October and from the figures we have supplied with regard to last October, and to deduce that that is going to be the normal condition of the Territorial Force on such points as the age of the men, and so on, he is forgetting that the Force was in those days only eighteen months old. It is quite true that last October there were, out of a total strength of 260,000 odd men, 98,000 under twenty years of age; but considering that during the eighteen months the Territorial Force had been in existence no fewer than 172,000 recruits had joined&#x2014;that is to say, 172,000 out of a total of 260,000 were men who had joined since April 1, 1908&#x2014;it is not surprising that you should find that 98,000 were under twenty years of age.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02195"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Were those all men who had not served in the Volunteers before?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02196"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The great majority of them were men who had not served, but there was a certain number who left the Volunteer Force at the time of transition, when the Volunteers ceased to exist, and who subsequently joined the Territorial Force. It was not a large number, and the greater part of the 172,000 men referred to were recruits in the fullest sense of the term. Therefore it is, of course, perfectly obvious, when you come to consider that the minimum period for which a man can join the Territorial Force is four years, and that we have every reason to suppose that the average period of service will be more like five years&#x2014;any way it will be well over four years&#x2014;that it is impossible to deduce with any correctness that the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0519"/>
<col>987</col>
number of men under twenty years of age last October is likely to be any criterion of what the number will be when the Force reaches the normal.<lb/>
Then the noble Duke raised the question of the mobilisation of the Artillery. He referred to the fact that we lay it down that when a Reservist goes to camp to take the place of a man in the Territorial Force he should take that man's rifle and equipment, and he cited the fact that there are, as we know, under ordinary training conditions a considerable number of horses that are used by more than one Territorial unit. But I should be insulting the noble Duke's knowledge and intelligence if I thought that he really deduced anything serious from that. If he had done us the honour to read the scheme which we have sent out to County Associations dealing with the method by which we propose to supply horses on mobilisation, he would have seen that it is not right to say that the Artillery will be without horses when mobilised. The fact that under ordinary training conditions each Yeomanry regiment may not have its own horses actually earmarked does not mean that they will not have horses provided for them on mobilisation; and in the matter of rifles a very large reserve is kept which will far more than suffice for equipping Territorial Reservists and all the troops we shall mobilise.<lb/>
I now come to the question of musketry, which was, I think, one of the principal points the noble Duke raised. That is the question which we discussed very fully on the last occasion. I think had the noble Duke been here then he would not have said what he did, that all that a trained man has to do is to fire twenty-three rounds of ammunition on a range. It is quite true that the actual course by which a man qualifies is twenty-three rounds at an open range, but to give the impression that all he has to do is to fire twenty-three rounds on an open range is erroneous. We issue for each man ninety rounds, and we lay down a course in which he has to fire twenty-three rounds&#x2014;a course which is in its actual conditions at least as stiff, or stiffer, than the average course which is fired by the Regular soldier of many of the big European armies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02197"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Lord mean by open range a full
<col>988</col>
distance range of 1,000 yards or a range of 30 yards?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02198"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: A full distance range up to 500 yards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02199"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: But does not the term "open range" include a range of 30 yards?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02200"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: If it does, I am sorry. I meant a full length range. As I say, this is an extremely stiff test. It is a great deal stiffer than the test that had to be passed in the old Volunteers, and a man who can pass it satisfactorily is at least as good a shot as the average European Regular soldier. If a man is a good shot and he goes straight down to the range and fires his twenty-three rounds and passes, he is up to the standard that we require for the Territorial Force. If he does not, he has not only the rest of the ninety rounds to fire, but he is able under this system, which is economic and elastic, to be further trained with the rounds that are saved out of the ninety issued for those men who are able to pass their course straight away. I hope I make that clear. The result is that already, although this course has only been in existence for one year, our reports go to show that the general standard is improving. The noble Duke talked about the musketry of the Territorial Force being in a state of paralysis. I can assure him that it is nothing of the kind. It is in a very vigorous state. It is in a much more vigorous state than it ever was in the Volunteers, and our great difficulty is, not to waken it out of a state of paralysis, but to find it scope for its energies in the matter of ranges.<lb/>
This range question has been a great difficulty. It was the lack of range facilities that accounted for the very large number of 35,000 men who were not tested, and it also undoubtedly accounted for the very large number of 39,000 recruits and 25,000 trained men who failed to qualify. With the present course the average man who does not fire straight away has to attend more often at the range than he did before. The ranges, therefore, are more used, there is more congestion on them, and that is the chief reason why this considerable number was not tested, and why there was also a considerable number who failed. We do everything we possibly can in the matter of providing
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0520"/>
<col>989</col>
ranges. There were seven battalions, as I think I told the House on the last occasion, who could not get on an open range at all last year. We hope to have full length ranges for at any rate five of them this year, and in order to relieve the congestion we are providing a large number of additional ranges. We are spending over &#x00A3;30,000 on a range near Birmingham, and another in Northumberland. We are spending over &#x00A3;20,000 on one in Lancashire, and over &#x00A3;11,000 on one in the West Riding, whilst at Purfleet, in Essex, we hope this year to open what will probably be one of the biggest ranges in this country&#x2014;a range which has cost us a quarter of a million. Besides that we have sanctioned, I think I may says dozens, of what the noble Duke calls open ranges&#x2014;that is to say, short ranges on which you can use the Service rifle and Service ammunition&#x2014;and in the case of every drill-hall that we are sanctioning now, and we are sanctioning a very large number, we are adding a certain amount of money to enable miniature ranges to be erected in them, so that we are making great steps in the provision of range accommodation for the Territorial Force. This year, also, General Officers Commanding, warned by what happened last year, have taken steps to start the musketry earlier in the season. I have every reason to hope that we shall have a more satisfactory musketry report this year than we had last year. There is no question that far more attention is being paid to musketry, that the standard of musketry is rising rapidly, and will, we are convinced, continue to rise in the Territorial Force. I am sure that if the noble Duke knew all the facts he would admit that musketry is one of the matters in connection with which great progress has been made. As to range finding, the whole question of range finding, of judging distance, of visual training, and all that, is difficult and complicated, but we are dealing with it by getting as many Territorial officers as we can to attend the course at Hythe, and by starting local musketry classes for them, in order that they may be able to instruct their men. That is the position with regard to musketry.<lb/>
I now come to the three Questions which the noble Duke asks. With regard to the first of those Questions, as far as I know we have never said, and never implied, that we regarded the Territorial Force as
<col>990</col>
anything but Second Line troops&#x2014;that is to say, troops who require a further period of embodiment before they can be considered fit for field operations on active service. It is quite true that in the event of general mobilisation they would be at once embodied and would proceed to their war stations. But if we found ourselves at war under conditions which rendered us liable to invasion of any considerable scale on the outbreak of hostilities, the duty of repelling it would at once be shared by part of the Regular Army and by the Special Reservists as well as by the Territorials. I think that makes our position perfectly plain with regard to that.<lb/>
I am afraid we are not inclined to agree with the suggestion in the noble Duke's second Question. It is true that there are a few battalions which, owing, again, to the lack of range accommodation, will do their ordinary Territorial musketry course during the camp. We do not lay ourselves out in training Second Lino troops to train them in any one particular branch up to the standard of Regular troops, but we give them a certain amount of training to bring them up to a certain standard in each particular branch. Therefore we do not see the point of putting them through the kind of thorough musketry course which a Line Battalion would require. The object of the camp we consider is to enable the force to practice those field exercises for companies, battalions, brigades, and so on, which they have to learn, and we have no reason to suppose that as soon as sufficient range facilities exist the requisite standard of musketry efficiency cannot be reached during the non-camping period.<lb/>
As to the third Question, I confess I do not understand the noble Duke's point. There is a legal liability on every man of the Territorial Force to come out and be embodied at the time of general mobilisation, and he is bound by that legal liability to remain out as long as he is required. He voluntarily undertakes that liability, and we have no reason whatever to suppose that he is not perfectly prepared to carry it out. Though it is true that when a general mobilisation of the Regular Army and its Reserves is ordered the Territorial Force is automatically embodied, it is not necessary to call it up. It may be embodied and not called up. I am not expressing
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0521"/>
<col>991</col>
myself technically, but the embodiment may lie dormant, if that makes it plainer. Either that can be done or the Government can, if it likes, after the embodiment has taken place and after the Territorial Force has been called up, dismiss the men to their homes. The embodiment would still remain in force, and they could be called up again the moment they were wanted. In those circumstances it is difficult to lay down exactly what would or would not happen, but it seems to me that the Government of the day, possessing these powers, might call up the Territorial Force for its period of training on embodiment in order to bring it up to the requisite standard of efficiency. One would imagine, however, that if there was no need of the services of these men after that, the Government would hardly keep them called up, and if invasion was out of the question they would be permitted to return to their homes. When the Act was drawn up the framers had that object in view, so as to enable the Government of the day only to have the Force actually called up when it was required for the safety of the country. I am quite convinced of this, that when it is a question of the safety of the country there is not one single Territorial who will grudge being called up for a period of prolonged training in order to secure that safety.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02201"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to prolong this debate at any length, but there are one or two points to which I should like to refer. The noble Duke, in dealing with the question of musketry&#x2014;and I own that as a Territorial myself I think he did well in calling attention to the matter&#x2014;very naturally pressed the point as to the alteration which has taken place between qualification and efficiency. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary has explained very clearly that owing to the shortage of range accommodation a few entire units and a great many men generally have been unable to fire the necessary number of rounds. Obviously that is no fault of their own, and if the grant to which they would be entitled if they had fired the requisite number of shots, which they were perfectly ready to do, was withdrawn from the County Association, it would place County Associations in a very difficult position indeed. Therefore, speaking as a member of a County Association, I think the Army Council were well advised
<col>992</col>
in making that distinction. At the same time we all fully realise that a man who has not fired the proper number of shots is not efficient as a defender of our coasts, and when the proper range accommodation is provided it will be the duty of those who are responsible for the musketry to see that the members of the Territorial Force make themselves efficient in that direction.<lb/>
The noble Duke referred to the fact that four or five members of a West Kent Regiment were fined because they had not made themselves efficient. Obviously the difference between those members of the Territorial Force and the others to whom reference has been made is that the four or five West Kent men wilfully abstained from performing the duty they had undertaken, at least so I imagine. It is most important that there should be sufficient range accommodation for the whole of the Territorial Force. My noble friend Lord Midleton asked a question as to the proportion of real recruits as distinct from those who had re-engaged from the Volunteers. I have not got the whole of the figures before me, but at the annual training in the year before last, in the case of practically a new battalion with which I am acquainted and which was in camp up to almost its full strength&#x2014;namely, ninety-nine per cent.&#x2014;600 of the men were actually recruits as distinct from those who had re-engaged from the Volunteers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02202"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I misunderstood the noble Viscount's Question. The noble Earl who is now speaking is referring to the number of men who transferred from the Volunteers to the Territorials and the proportion they bear to the new recruits. I understood, when I said that there were very few, that the noble Viscount was asking what number of men had left the Volunteer Force when it came to an end and had subsequently changed their mind and enlisted in the Territorial Army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02203"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My desire was to know how many of the 172,000 men had been Volunteers, whether they had left the Volunteers or not, and how many were new recruits.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0005P0I0522"/>
<col>993</col>
a question which was not asked. Then the noble Duke referred to distinguished persons visiting camps. I should like to say a word on that. The camps of the Territorials have been visited on more than one occasion by distinguished foreigners, and their comments were generally most satisfactory to the Force. I wish that more distinguished persons would visit the camps and see the Territorials at work, because, from my own experience of what they can do, I can assure those who are inclined to cry down the annual training of the Territorials that the work the men are called upon to do in camp is of a very searching character indeed. I have seen battalion after battalion taking its turn to go out night after night on the Welsh hills, sleeping out with nothing but their blanket, and cooking their own rations exactly as they would do on war service. It is a little hard on the Territorials that there should be such a desire on the part of some people to throw ridicule upon them. A visit to the training camps and an experience of the energy with which the men throw themselves into their work would effectively remove erroneous opinions of the Force.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Under-Secretary referred to the course at Hythe. That is one of the great difficulties with regard to Territorial officers, and I know many cases where officers and non-commissioned officers have at considerable expense and trouble become attached to Regular batteries&#x2014;I am speaking more particularly of the Artillery&#x2014;in order to make themselves as efficient as possible in the work they have to do. It is not a satisfactory system, because the Regular batteries have their own work to do; they are themselves very often short of horses and naturally do not want to have a lot of untrained officers and men learning the work at their expense. I think that the Army Council should carefully consider the best means of giving opportunity of training to the various officers in the Territorial Force, especially those in the more technical arms.<lb/>
The only other point to which I would refer is the question of mobilisation. That, again, is a matter of considerable moment, because we are always being threatened with surprise mobilisations, which, fortunately for the country, have not yet taken place. I ventured some months ago&#x2014;I think it was early in
<col>994</col>
January&#x2014;to write to the War Office on certain points with regard to mobilisation to find out, as far as I could, what part of the mobilisation requirements would have to be provided by the County Associations, and what part would be provided by the military authorities. No doubt those questions&#x2014;there were a good many of them&#x2014;were of rather a technical character, and having had an acknowledgment that the matter would be considered I ventured to write again a few weeks ago, and received a reply that the matter was still being considered. I should like to suggest that it is very important to members of County Associations to know exactly what they will have themselves to provide in case of mobilisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02206"><member>LORD SEMPILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord the Under-Secretary has assumed that the noble Duke might feel quite at ease as regards the question of the supply of horses on mobilisation. He assumes this on the Circular Memorandum issued by the Army Council, but my recollection is that the County Associations were asked to express their opinion as to the workability of the scheme. I should like to ask the noble Lord whether the replies received from the County Associations were satisfactory. I know that the reply of the Association with which I have to deal was that they did not find the scheme at all workable. It is impossible to carry all these memoranda in one's head, but one of the provisions, I recollect, was that there were to be so many collectors appointed, and that these gentlemen were not to get any remuneration until mobilisation actually took place, when they were to receive three guineas a day. I think it will be admitted that it is a very thankless task to perform this duly and keep the record of horses available up to date, but to wait until mobilisation before receiving any remuneration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02207"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to carry on this discussion this evening, because I understand the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, has given notice of a Motion to call attention to the whole position of the Territorial Force. I think your Lordships will be invited to discuss that very shortly. But I should be sorry if from any remarks which fell from Lord Dartmouth it was supposed that there was any desire on this side of the House to detract from the position and training of the Territorial Force. I do not think that
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0523"/>
<col>995</col>
that is in the slightest degree the idea with which the noble Duke put his Questions on the Paper. Those who know the noble Duke's mind, as your Lordships do from the numerous interesting speeches he has delivered at different times, are aware that he resents as a national misfortune the abolition of the Force which stood between the Volunteers and the Regular Army, and which could be called upon first for a much longer period of training than the Territorial Army is to receive; and I think that on many occasions the noble Duke has given your Lordships reasons for considerable uneasiness as to the change which has taken place&#x2014;an uneasiness which I must confess, for my own part, is not dispelled by a perusal of the Parliamentary Return to which allusion is made in the noble Duke's Questions.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite spoke of the Territorial Army as not being intended to be anything but a Second Line Force. That we quite understand; but events would probably place them in the first line of defence within a very few days on the question of invasion. When we look at this Return and see that eighteen Special Reserve regiments which have at this moment 383 officers are deficient of 373 officers, or fifty per cent., and that the rest of the Special Reserve battalions have a deficit of 970, or thirty-three per cent., I think we must admit that there is some occasion for anxiety as to the military value of the Special Reserve on which we must rely unless we are to put the Territorial Force immediately in the front line. There is not the slightest intention to minimise the admirable character of the Territorial Force, or to deny that their military value is greater than that of the old Volunteers, their organisation having been gradually improved. When the inability of the
<col>996</col>
men to attend camp, the insufficiency of the ranges, and the shortage of horses are referred to, these criticisms are intended to show that the Force, having regard to its condition of service, is unable to attain the standard of efficiency desired. For that reason I am glad that the noble Earl has placed a Motion on the Paper to call attention to the present condition of the Territorial Force.<lb/>
I have risen only for the purpose of asking the noble Lord the Under-Secretary whether, having given us this very important Paper, he would be prepared to supplement the information by giving us a Return which would show the cost of the Volunteers and Yeomanry under the old conditions in any year not touched by the South African War as compared with the cost of the Territorial Army in the year 1909. I think that information will be of great advantage to us when we come to discuss the question. There is a good deal of misapprehension as to the generosity, so to speak, of the Government in regard to the Territorial Force&#x2014;a misapprehension which it is most important to clear up. The real point in most minds is this: if the Force is to stand where it is it must be made efficient, and if it cannot be made efficient on the present terms we must consider whether Parliament can be induced to grant better terms. At any rate, the public ought to know whether they are now getting better value for their money than under the old conditions.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CATTLE FOOD PROSECUTIONS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02248"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> rose to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries why the consent of the Board of Agriculture required by the Fertiliser and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906, Section 6, subsection (3), was withheld in a case where the official analyst appointed by the county of Devon found that in the sample of cattle food in question there was forty per cent. of wood sawdust, and the county wished to prosecute under Section 6, subsection (1) (<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02249">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Question which I have put on the Paper is one that to agriculturists is of very considerable importance. When the Fertiliser and Feeding Stuffs Act was passing through Parliament the county councils objected very strongly, but ineffectively, to being dependent, in prosecuting for offences under the Act, upon the consent of the Board of Agriculture, and I think the present case brings out very forcibly the objections that there are to limiting the power of prosecution on the part of county councils. When one comes to consider it, one cannot help arriving at the conclusion that probably the only real solution of the difficulty, and it is a very grave one, is an amendment of the Act.</p>
<col>1000</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02250">The facts of the case are practically these. The foodstuff in question was analysed according to the provision contained in the Act. Section 1, subsection (2), of the Act provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"Every person who sells for use as food for cattle or poultry any article which has been artificially prepared shall give to the purchaser an invoice stating the name of the article, and whether it has been prepared from one substance or seed or from more than one substance or seed, and in the case of any article artificially prepared otherwise than by being mixed, broken, ground, or chopped, what are the respective percentages (if any) of oil and albuminoids contained in the article, and the invoice shall have effect as a warranty by the seller as to the facts so stated, except that as respects percentages the invoice shall have effect as a warranty only that the actual percentages do not differ from those stated in the invoice beyond the prescribed limits of error."</quote>
In this case the invoice which was sent with the article only contained a statement as to the quantity of foodstuff sent. There was, however, a printed slip attached to one of the invoices which stated that this particular food was a mixture of pure cellulose and cane-sugar. It did contain the sugar&#x2014;the molasses&#x2014;and it contained this other material which the analyst said was wood sawdust. The manufacturers of the article practically do not dispute the fact that it had originally been wood sawdust, but they contend that&#x2014;
<quote>"after wood has been chemically disintegrated and all its original and chief constituents have so radically been altered as in the process my company carried out, it must be clear to the most uninitiated that the original substance can no longer exist or be referred to as such."</quote>
It is quite evident from this that the county analyst was right in saying that a large proportion was sawdust. Wood sawdust, of course, contains a large quantity of the materials which were claimed to be in this actual compound. There was cellulose tissue to the amount, I believe, of some thirty per cent. of the solid matter, whereas ordinary wood fibre would contain from about sixteen to seven.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02251">The point which I wish particularly to bring before the House is that this entirely new substance is thrust upon the market without any recognised certificate of what it possesses, what is its food value, or anything of the kind, and when the Devon County Council, on behalf of the agriculturists of the county, endeavoured to prove whether or not this is valuable as a foodstuff, the Board of Agriculture refused their consent to a prosecution. The point
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0526"/>
<col>1001</col>
they raised in defence of refusing their consent was that litigation would cast a heavy burden upon the rates of the litigant county and perhaps be unsuccessful. By this action the Board of Agriculture, having no power to decide the matter themselves, have barred the only means which the Act gives of deciding the question. Either there should be some power to prevent a manufacturer, however scientific, however useful his invention, placing upon the market an article of this description without some certificate of its nature, or else it should be open to a county council, on behalf of those who are aggrieved, to bring the matter before the only tribunal open to them&#x2014;namely, a Court of law. I beg to ask the Question which stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02252"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord at the commencement of his Question alludes to the necessity of the consent of the Board of Agriculture to prosecutions initiated by the different county councils. Your Lordships will remember that in 1906, when the amending Bill was before this House, the noble Lord brought forward an Amendment to the effect that the consent of the Board of Agriculture in such eases should not be required. He brought that Amendment forward in Committee, but withdrew it, I think, because he said it was not strictly consonant with the feeling of the House at the time. Your Lordships' House decided that question, and until the law is altered we must act on the law as it stands. The noble Lord will forgive me, therefore, if I do not pursue that portion of the subject further.<lb/>
The Question which the noble Lord asks is, why the consent of the Board of Agriculture required by the Fertiliser and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906, Section 6, subsection (3), was withheld in a case where the official analyst appointed by the county of Devon found that in the sample of cattle food in question there was forty per cent. of wood sawdust and the county wished to prosecute under Section 6, subsection (1) (<i>b</i>). The sanction of the Board was asked to a prosecution under Section 6 of the Act. Perhaps I may be allowed to read subsection (1) of that section&#x2014;
<quote>"If any person who sells any article for use&#x2026;as food for cattle or poultry commits any of the following offences,namely&#x2014;
<col>1002</col>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) fails without reasonable excuse to give, on or before or as soon as possible after the delivery of the article, the invoice required by this Act; or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) causes or permits any invoice or description of the article sold by him to be false in any material particular to the prejudice of the purchaser;</li>
</ol>
he shall, without prejudice to any civil liability, be liable, on summary conviction, for a first offence to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;20, and for any subsequent offence to a line not exceeding &#x00A3;50."</quote>
The Section further goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"A prosecution for an offence under this section shall not be instituted except with the consent of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Board shall not give such consent until the part of the sample retained by the agricultural analyst has been analysed, and a certificate of analysis given, by the chief analyst."</quote>
The law has been carried out, for this has been done, and the Board do not find that the invoice or description was in any way false. That is what we had to decide. Examination of the material in question does not confirm in all particulars the statements made by the Devon analyst.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be permitted to describe what this cattle foodstuff is. The article in question consists of a mixture of molasses and some absorbent material. The House knows that molasses is an extract from sugar-cane. It is a sticky liquid compound, and some absorbent material is added to the molasses whereby it is brought into a sort of powder, and then it is sprinkled over the hay or feeding stuff, instead of the old-fashioned way of putting the molasses into a watering-pot, adding water, and then watering the hay from the watering-pot. This absorbent material is derived from wood; there is no doubt at all about that. It is sawdust, which has undergone some chemical treatment&#x2014;that is the secret of the trade&#x2014;whereby it becomes to some extent digestible. That to laymen like most of us seems an extraordinary statement, but in this respect it does not stand alone. This particular cattle food must be classed with other sugar foods, the absorbent material of which is of very little or no feeding value. These absorbents are only used as a medium for absorbing the molasses, which, as your Lordships know, is a Valuable food for cattle. The Board are taking steps to investigate further the composition of this substance and its suitability as a feeding stuff. That, I think, answers the Question of the noble Lord.<lb/>
Your Lordships must bear in mind that the Board are not only criticised under the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0527"/>
<col>1003</col>
Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act from the agricultural point of view, but also by the traders themselves, and we have had several complaints against us of having been too free in sanctioning prosecutions. We are in a very difficult position, but we do the best we can to bold an impartial hand. Our great object is to try to do justice in each case. That is the reason why we have been unable to comply with the desire of the Devon County Council to begin a prosecution against the persons interested in this trade. We are informed that the analysis of the Devon county official is not correct, and we are also informed by our legal representatives that no action at law would hold water. In these circumstances I think your Lordships will admit that we have done the only thing that lay in our power.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02253"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Earl whether the Board's analyst says that the statement which was made by the makers of this material&#x2014;namely, that it was a mixture of pure cellulose and cane-sugar molasses&#x2014;was in fact true. The county analyst only found that there was thirty per cent. of cellulose in the forty per cent. of solid matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02254"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am not a chemist, and therefore my opinion is not worth much. The analysis of Mr. Dutton, the Devon analyst, only brings in thirty per cent. of cellulose. That, I am informed by our chemist, is incorrect, and that is one of the reasons why the local official's analysis could not be accepted by the chief analyst of the Government Department.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02255"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: What I wanted to know was this&#x2014;whether the analyst to the Board of Agriculture asserts that the definition given of this material by the makers is an absolutely true one?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02256"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I believe it is, and that there is no fraud. The chief analyst does not find anything wrong or anything fraudulent whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02257"><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Earl whether, if further researches lead to the conclusion that sawdust treated in the manner he describes is less digestible rather than more so, he will consider whether leave might not be
<col>1004</col>
given to prosecute the seller of this article under Section 6, subsection 1 (<i>c</i>), of the Act, which makes a man liable to prosecution if he sells for use as food for cattle or poultry any article to which has been added any ingredient worthless for feeding purposes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02258"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I believe the feeding quality of this cellulose is not great, but not absolutely worthless, and therefore I do not suppose a prosecution would lie.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02259"><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: I hope that the noble Earl will be able to give us some further information on this subject at a future time, because in this case there has been either decided fraud in selling stuff which has little or no value at 7<i>s</i>. a cwt., or else there are opportunities opening up for owners of timber to convert it in a manner and for a purpose which they have not hitherto found possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02260"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Noble Lords opposite have entirely shifted their ground. If they will bring forward this new point on a future occasion, I shall be only too glad to go into it to the best of my ability.</membercontribution></p>

Joseph Chamberlain when President of the Board of Trade in 1884, and to the reports of the Courts of Inquiry into the circumstances attending the abandonment and loss of the "Cadoxton" on the 22nd of November, 1909, and the abandonment and loss of the "Kingswell" on the 21st of January, 1910; also to an article on the over-insurance of ships which appeared in <i>The Times</i> of the 4th of February, 1910, which contained what the writer considered to be a solution of the problem of the insuring of the older class of ships; and to ask His Majesty's Government whether they will make preparations for following up their legislation of last year on P.P.I. policies by drawing up and introducing a Bill making over-insurance against total loss illegal, and punishable by fines so graduated as to make any profit on such transactions impossible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02262">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Government axe to be congratulated on
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0528"/>
<col>1005</col>
having passed a Bill dealing with P.P.I. policies last year, which has had the effect of checking these insurances on ships which were made as a gamble by persons who had no interest whatever in the ships concerned. That measure, however, only dealt with a portion of the evils connected with the insurance of "crazy" vessels. It was passed with the approval of both sides of both Houses of Parliament, and I am sanguine enough to say that I hope before long to see another Bill passed as a non-Party measure, which will have the effect of putting an end to the over-insurance of old and worthless ships. Outsiders have been warned off by the P.P.I. Act, but the system and practice of some owners and underwriters in connection with worn-out vessels has, since the passing of that Act, been severely criticised by Courts of Inquiry which have looked into cases of total loss. Under the present system, some shipowners still make more money by the loss of a ship than they would by her safe arrival in port. When these ships are never heard of again after leaving harbour, it is very difficult to get sufficient evidence as to the cause of their loss, because the principal witnesses are drowned. Even when the crew are saved and the vessel is abandoned in the open sea, the inquiry into her loss is something like a coroner's inquest without a <i>post mortem</i>, the evidence in connection with which is often more important than all the rest of the depositions. The crews of these ships who are unrepresented in the other House are worthy of more attention than they generally receive, and although there may be differences of opinion as to the actual distribution of the burden, I think that it is quite clear that every penny-worth of property that goes to the bottom of the sea is taken from the available wealth and productive resources of this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02263">The "Cadoxton" was thirty years old. She left Cardiff for Lisbon on November 16,1909, with a crew of eighteen men and a cargo of coal. She met with heavy weather, and was abandoned on November 22 at the mouth of the Channel. Her crew were picked up by a passing Vessel. The Court at Cardiff considered that the outside value of the ship was &#x00A3;6,000. Her hull and machinery were insured for &#x00A3;12,000, exactly double her worth, and the total of the insurances amounted to &#x00A3;14,000. The owners were, therefore, in the position
<col>1006</col>
of a racing man who stood to win &#x00A3;8,000 on bets against his own horse. The Court reported that&#x2014;
<quote>"The loss of the vessel was due primarily to her making abnormal water owing to some mysterious cause, and proximately to the omissions of the master and chief engineer to take prompt and obviously available measures, for which the Court finds them in default."</quote>
In the annex to the report they stated&#x2014;
<quote>"There is considerable conflict of evidence as to when the vessel was first found to be making an unusual quantity of water. Many of the witnesses are not only directly in conflict with each other, but (notably the master and chief engineer) also self-contradictory. But in the mass of discrepancies, of contradictions and inconsistencies disclosed by the evidence, there are also some matters constituting common ground, and some matters not in dispute."</quote>
The Court concluded by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"'The Cadoxton' did not sustain serious damage. For the reasons above stated, her abandonment was caused by the wrongful default and serious omissions of the master and chief engineer. If proper measures had been taken she might have been saved. The culpable omissions of the master and chief engineer indicate an absence of desire to save the vessel. There is evidence that neither the master nor engineer had any pecuniary interest in the vessel; and there is no evidence that either of them knew that the vessel was more valuable to her owners when foundered than when afloat. But the Court notes that the history of, and the story of the loss of, the 'Cadoxton' are not dissimilar from previous wreck eases in their salient features&#x2014;viz.: an old vessel, trading at a loss, over-insured, cause of loss a mystery, and neglect of prompt and obviously available measures to save the vessel."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02264">The inquiry into the case of the "Kingswell" was held at Newcastle-on-Tyne. The Court was composed of different judges and assessors from that which sat on the "Cadoxton" at Cardiff. The "Kingswell" was nineteen years old, she had had a severe collision in 1908 and was beached at Hythe to prevent her sinking. Her hull was seriously damaged, her deck plates being twisted. After being repaired she was sold for &#x00A3;9,000 in July, 1909. The Court stated&#x2014;
<quote>"The shareholders consisted of friends and business connections of the manager, and on the 26th August, 1909, the vessel was mortgaged by Lloyd's Bank, Limited, to secure an account current and interest on which at the time of the casualty about &#x00A3;5,000 was due. The vessel was insured for &#x00A3;14,000, and in addition the manager effected a disbursement policy on his own account of &#x00A3;1,000. Here was a comparatively old ship with a somewhat chequered career&#x2014;a ship which had not been continuously kept up to standard as regards her condition, and whose market price, under the circumstances detailed, was but &#x00A3;9,000,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0529"/>
<col>1007</col>
actually insured for &#x00A3;15,000. The premiums for the twelve months amounted to some &#x00A3;2,000 and were payable in advance, and nearly the whole of this was provided by the ship's insurance brokers, to whom bills were given by the company to cover the amount advanced. It is fair to the manager to say that he made some attempt to get the vessel insured for a rather less amount but unsuccessfully. The system under which Lloyd's and other insurance agencies insure old vessels of this character at a figure far above their market value is, in the opinion of the Court, most pernicious, and is, in effect, a gamble. If such vessels were insured only for their market value, and there were not the chance of a 'total loss' resulting in a 'handsome profit' to the owners, the certainty is that it would not pay to keep them afloat, and they would be 'scrapped.'"</quote>
The "Kingswell" carried a crew of twenty-two hands, and left the Tyne on December 6 last. On her way out she bumped on the Galloper Shoal but no entry of this was made in the log. She arrived at Siphnos, an island in the&#x00C6;gean Sea, on January 14. She was loaded up with 3,400 tons of iron ore, and left on the 19th. On the 20th she met with bad weather, and on the 21st she was abandoned in a hopeless condition. We here have two Courts differently constituted, sitting one at Newcastle and the other at Cardiff, strongly condemning the present system of over-insurance of worn-out or damaged ships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02265">The "Selworthy" took a cargo of coals from Cardiff to Las Palmas. She left that place on March 16. An explosion took place on board of her on the 17th, she was abandoned shortly afterwards. I have much sympathy for her unfortunate crew, who were forty-three hours in her boats before being picked up by a passing steamer. But I have none whatever for her fortunate owners, because, if <i>The Times</i> report of June 11 is correct, her managing owner stated that he had purchased her for &#x00A3;8,300 and that the total of the insurances amounted to &#x00A3;15,750&#x2014;a gain to them of over &#x00A3;7,000. The captain of the ship attributed her loss to twenty-four-hour bombs placed on board of her by labourers, who had threatened to damage her winches while discharging her at Las Palmas. As a Home Office inquiry into the cause of the explosion appears to be still going on, and as the Board of Trade inquiry has not yet been held, I shall say no more about her, except to express a wish that the inquiry into the causes of her loss may be thorough, and to say that it is a case in which I think detectives might be usefully employed.</p>
<col>1008</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02266">The article in <i>The Times</i> of February 4 is too lengthy and too technical to be suitable for repetition in a speech. It is, however, well worthy of perusal. Most persons, however, if unacquainted with the subject, would have to read it twice before understanding it thoroughly. The following solution of the problem is suggested in it&#x2014;
<quote>"The arrangement is for underwriters to insist on a high valuation on not very desirable boats for ordinary claims, but to pay only a certain proportion of that amount, perhaps seventy-five, sixty, or fifty per cent., should a total loss occur."</quote>
Thus in case of an accident repairs would be paid for in full, but in case of a total loss only a percentage of the sum insured. In my opinion, the smaller the percentage the better. In the case of an over-insurance, the owner makes a bet against the safe arrival of his own ship. Your Lordships all know what the Jockey Club would do to one found to be betting many thousands against his own horse. Now I should like to see the over-insuring managing owner warned off the Newmarket Heath of shipowning, and forced to sell all his interest in ships within three months of such an offence being proved against him, under penalty of such interest being forfeited to the Crown. One remedy against over-insurance would be to enlarge the powers of the Courts of Inquiry. They have power to stop a negligent captain from earning his livelihood at sea. Why not give them similar powers to deal with any owner if by his misconduct, negligence, or undue economy, he has contributed to the loss of a ship? The owner should, of course, have the right of appeal to a higher Court. If such was the law, there would be fewer of these managing owners of single ship companies who bring such discredit on the shipowning profession. It has been said that if the law was to interfere with maritime insurance it would drive the work abroad. In my opinion it is only the dirty work that would go abroad. Foreigners who found that they were only insuring "crazy" ships would soon get sick of it. The clean work would remain in England. It is only because the dirty work has been mixed up with the clean work that it has been allowed to go on so long.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02267">Part of Clause 6 of Mr. Chamberlain's Bill of 1884 was as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary or any valuation in a policy of the subject-matter of insurance&#x2014;</quote>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0530"/>
<col>1009</col>
<quote>(1) A marine insurance, whether effected by one or more policies for a sum that exceeds the insurance value of the subject-matter of insurance, shall be valid to the extent of the insurance value and no more, and shall be void as to any excess of the insurance value; and in case such insurance is effected by several policies shall be void to the extent of a rateable part of the excess over the insurance value and shall be valid for the residue only.</quote>
<quote>(7) Under an insurance on a ship the insurance value shall not cover or include the cost of or expenses of wages, provisions, stores, consumable outfit of any kind, or any outlay incurred in sending a ship to sea on a voyage with a view to earning freight.</quote>
<quote>(8) When freight is insured and the costs and expenses of wages, provisions, and stores, consumable outfit of any kind, or other outlay incurred in sending the ship to sea with a view to earning such freights are insured or covered by any other insurance or insurances effected by or on behalf of the same person as effected the insurance on the freight there shall be deemed a double insurance of such freight lossand expenses.</quote>
The ninth subsection dealt with what are practically double insurances. Clause 19 ran as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"(1) Any person who shall insure by or effect any insurance declared to be void by the Act passed in the nineteenth year of His Majesty George the Second, intituled an Act to regulate insurance on ships belonging to the Subjects of Great Britain and on Merchandises or Effects laden thereon, shall incur a penalty equal in amount to the whole sum insured by the void insurance.</quote>
<quote>(2) Any person who, being the owner of a ship, or of any interest therein, on being entitled to receive or interested in the freight of a ship, shall knowingly effect any insurance declared by this Act to be void, or for the purpose of evading or contravening any of the provisions of this Act, shall incur a penalty equal in amount to the whole sum insured by such insurance."</quote>
As regards subsection (2), I think it would be right to strike out the word "knowingly." It is part of a shipowner's business to know the value of his ship. He has the means of knowing it, and he really does know it unless he is abnormally stupid, in which case he is unfit to own a ship. He knows what he has paid for his ships, the accidents that have happened to them, what he has spent on repairs, and the average amount of the depreciation of ships of their class. Subsections (3) and (4) ran&#x2014;
<quote>"(3) Any person who as an insurer shall knowingly insure by any insurance declared by this Act to be void, or for the purpose of evading or contravening any of the provisions of this Act, shall incur a penalty equal in amount to three times the value of the premium received or contracted for by such person as the consideration for effecting such insurance.</quote>
<quote>(4) The provisions of this section shall apply to all British subjects insuring or effecting insurances, wheresoever such insurances may be
<col>1010</col>
effected, and also to all insurances on British ships, wheresoever the same may be effected, and in the case of insurances of or with relation to foreign ships, to insurances effected within the limits of the United Kingdom."</quote>
In subsection (3), which deals with underwriters, I would not strike out the word "knowingly." Their position is quite different from that of the shipowner. An underwriter would have much greater difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the very much larger number of ships in whose fate he has an interest, especially when dealing with a bad class of shipowner, as the latter would attempt to deceive him. Had Clauses 6 and 19 become law in 1884, the owners of the "Cadoxton" would only have received about &#x00A3;6,000 for the loss of their vessel, and the over-insurance of &#x00A3;8,000 would have been forfeited as a penalty. In the case of the "Kingswell," &#x00A3;9,000 might have been paid to the owners and &#x00A3;6,000 would have been forfeited as a penalty. Whether the underwriters would also have had to pay penalties is not clear, but the premiums for the twelve months in the case of the "Kingswell" amounted to about &#x00A3;2,200. The rates were fifteen to sixteen guineas per cent., no discount, payable in advance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02268">Of the solutions that I have suggested, I greatly prefer Mr. Chamberlain's, but his Bill of 1884 contained 101 clauses and three schedules. It attempted too much, and had to be withdrawn in consequence. Had Clauses 6 and 19 become law, they would, I believe, have relieved the country of the disgrace of these over-insurances and their natural consequences. I can scarcely expect that any legislation on this subject will be non-contentious, but I hope, if the Government have the courage to bring in a short two clause Bill, that it will be strongly supported by the Opposition Benches in both Houses, and that both Parties will vie with each other in endeavouring to carry a Bill which will have the effect of doing away with what has been a shame and disgrace to Great Britain for many years. I also hope that such a Bill will have the support of the vast majority of shipowners, men who do not carry on their business on the lines that I have referred to. Though I feel very strongly, I have endeavoured to express myself in moderate language. There is a calm in Party politics at the present moment&#x2014;the calm in the centre of a
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0531"/>
<col>1011</col>
storm. Why not make use of that calm to pass a small non-Party measure for the benefit of British seamen?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02269"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRASSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having served as a member of the Royal Commission on Unseaworthy Ships and of many Select Committees of the other House of Parliament who have inquired into this subject, I rise, under a strong sense of duty, earnestly to support my noble and gallant friend. Of all the preventible causes of loss of life at sea, over-insurance is the most fatal. The testimony borne by experienced and authoritative witnesses before Royal Commissions is unanimous. I recall the evidence of Mr. Harper, secretary to the Salvage Association of Lloyd's, before the Commission on Unseaworthy Ships. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is in the very nature of things and in human nature that a rule of law which enables the assured to recover more than the value of the property insured must have a tendency to make the shipowner or shipmaster negligent. If we were to do away with insurance altogether, the business of this Commission would be at an end directly. The care of a ship divides itself into a hundred particulars: care in the appointment of a master, care in the selection of a crew, care in the condition of a ship when she leaves, and general watchfulness; and I say that it is certainly likely to be relaxed in the case of an owner who knows that if his ship goes to the bottom, perhaps from the very circumstance that he has not given sufficient attention to her, he not only gets the whole of his money invested in the ship but a profit besides into his pocket."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02270">Turn to the Commission on the Loss of Life at Sea. In their Report they give special prominence to the evidence they have received from Mr. Rothery, Wreck Commissioner. He was strong for amendment of the law of marine insurance. The seaman, as he pointed out, cannot insure his wages, and this prohibition is founded upon a very intelligible principle&#x2014;namely, that you should not hold out to him a premium to cast away his vessel or induce him to refrain from exercising all his energy in preventing her from becoming a wreck. Why the same principle should not be applied to the shipowner, and why he should be entitled to make a gain by losing his vessel, he never could understand. Both the Commissions to which I have referred were agreed as to first principles. Both concurred that insurance should not give to the shipowner more than an indemnity against loss.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02271">The Commission on Unseaworthy Ships laid it down that the contract of marine
<col>1012</col>
insurance is in its essence a contract of indemnity, and that the spirit of the contract is violated if the assured can make the occurrence of a loss the means of gain. The Commission on the Loss of Life at Sea reported in almost identical terms. The Commissions, whilst strongly recommending revision of the law, recognised that the process must be gradual. The Commission on Unseaworthy Ships recommended that an attempt should be made to induce foreign nations to adopt a general code. Action on this wise recommendation has been long delayed. It is never too late to mend. Pending the revision of the law, the remedy will best be found in the adoption of the suggestions which my noble and gallant friend has submitted to your Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02272">I venture to supplement the authoritative opinion of Commissions and the evidence of witnesses with a personal experience. Some years ago, while lying at anchor off Constantinople, a steamer from the Black Sea dropped anchor near us, evidently much overladen. In the course of the day I received a letter from the engineer of the ship saying that they were about to go to sea in a dangerous condition, and asking me to take steps to detain the ship. I went to the British Consul; he said that if the crew complained prompt steps should be taken to detain the ship. I went aboard. The crew were mustered and I addressed them, offering to carry any complaint to the Consul. Instantly the engineer stepped forward saying that he was entirely satisfied. No member of the crew desired to make complaint. The steamer proceeded. Off the English coast, and in moderate weather, she foundered. A pilot boat was alongside, and the crew were safely removed. An inquiry was held. It was shown that the steamer was over-insured to a large amount. The owners were paid in full. Under the rule proposed by my noble and gallant friend this miscarriage of justice would not have occurred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02273">In conclusion, it is cheering to turn from insurance against disaster to the notable reduction in deaths at sea by wreck and casualty. In 1887&#x2013;8 there was one casualty in 157 of the total number of the crews; ten years later, one in 397; in 1907&#x2013;8 one in 503. The improvement reflects the highest credit on our shipbuilders and shipowners. While correcting abuses in
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0532"/>
<col>1013</col>
the law of insurance, let us not insist on vexatious and imperfect surveys and regulations. I recall a telling speech at the Trinity House by Mr. Milner Gibson. Columbus, he said, would never have won the honour of being the discoverer of America if in his time there had been a Board of Trade at Cadiz with a President full of laudable zeal at its head responsible for the equipment of every ship in the port. The expedition would not have been allowed to start. My noble and gallant friend's suggestions will cause no embarrassment to the honest shipowner. They may do something to relieve him from the unfair competition of reckless men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02274"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not surprised to see this Question on the Paper in the name of the noble Lord opposite, because not only is the interest which he takes in everything appertaining to the welfare of merchant seamen well known to your Lordships, but I remember that last year when he supported the P.P.I. Bill he gave an indication that he intended to bring this matter forward at an early date. We were very much obliged to him for his support on that occasion, and we do not in any way complain that he has brought forward this matter to-day. The Government recognise most fully that in a maritime nation such as this Parliament should not lose sight of these matters, and I can assure the noble Lord that the particular question which he has raised is receiving the constant and close attention of the Board of Trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02275">The noble Lord calls attention in his Question to the loss of two particular ships which has occurred within recent months. He gave us a full account of the loss of those ships as far as it transpired at the Courts of Inquiry, and I do not think it is necessary for me to go over that ground again. The noble Lord pointed out, however, that in each case the Courts reported that the ships were insured considerably above their value. They also reported that in each case there was a certain amount of mystery connected with the loss of the ship; and, further, the Courts commented adversely in general terms upon the system of insuring ships considerably above their value. But it is to be observed, at the same time, that in both cases, although the Courts pointed out that there were suspicious circumstances
<col>1014</col>
I connected with the loss of the ship, they were not able to report that any malpractice I had actually taken place. In the case of the "Cadoxton" they went further, and stated that they found that two of the officers had been guilty of culpable negligence, but they did not seem to have been sufficiently convinced that that negligence was intentional to deal in any way with the, certificates of those officers&#x2014;a course which lay within their power had they thought it right and proper to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02276">I admit fully that the practice of insuring ships above their value is clearly open to abuse, and it is natural that when a ship which is known to have been insured considerably above her value is lost suspicion should be aroused. In these cases it is very seldom that you can get beyond suspicion. As the noble Lord has pointed out, it is in the nature of things that that should be so. Not that that is an absolute bar to action, because, as the noble Lord will remember, the case in favour of the P.P.I. Bill last year rested almost wholly on suspicion, but in that case the suspicion was so strong that it was held to justify the interference of the Government. What I would say is that in this case of over-insurance, if the suspicion again becomes strong and if my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade is persuaded that the suspicion is of such a nature that the Government ought to interfere, he will do so again; but I cannot say that as at present advised he is prepared to introduce legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02277">There are really three suggestions in the noble Lord's Question. There is, first of all, the course proposed in Mr. Chamberlain's Bill of 1884. Then there is the proposal contained in the last paragraph of the noble Lord's Question. Those two proposals both deal with penal legislation. I have no doubt that if it is found desirable to introduce legislation dealing with this matter, and if penal legislation is necessary, it would have to be more or less on those lines. I think that is clear. The other suggestion&#x2014;the suggestion contained in <i>The Times</i> article&#x2014;really deals with a new method of insurance, and if that commended itself to underwriters and to shipowners as being the fair method of carrying on their business, there is no reason why it should not be adopted. At the same time, it is not easy to see how either party or both parties could be com-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0533"/>
<col>1015</col>
pelled to adopt such a method against their will. What it would really amount to would be this, that underwriters would retain a high valuation of a ship for the purpose of determining partial loss and a low valuation for the purpose of determining the amount to be paid in the case of total loss. As that proposal appears in <i>The Times</i>, on the face of it it seems rather one-sided and to favour the underwriter as against the shipowner, but that is a detail which could no doubt be adjusted by mutual arrangement if this system met with the approval of the gentlemen engaged in these two businesses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02278">There is a point which I think one ought to mention in speaking of over-insurance. It is that in insuring a ship there are really two risks which are insured&#x2014;the risk of total loss, and the risk of partial loss. Those are really different things, and I will show where the difference comes in. An old ship is probably worth less in the market than a new ship, and for that reason it ought, no doubt, to be insured at a lower figure; but partial loss and damage is more likely to occur in the case of an old ship than in the case of a new one, and I understand that underwriters sometimes insist on a rather higher valuation of the ship than is justified by her actual value in the market, so as to protect themselves against that risk. That, I understand, accounts for these high values in many cases, and that is the reason why underwriters agree to them. In view of the fact that the Government are not prepared at present to introduce legislation to deal with this matter, I do not think that your Lordships will expect me to make any declaration in favour of any particular method of legislation supposing it is found to be desirable. That would clearly have to be based upon careful inquiry and investigation. What I would say is this, that I do not wish to minimise in the least the danger which may possibly arise, and in some cases probably has arisen, from over-insurance, but I hope the noble Lord will rest content with the assurance that the Board of Trade are keeping a very watchful eye on this matter, and will accept the Bill of last year as an earnest of the fact that if action is shown to be necessary the Government will not hesitate to take it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02279">Then the noble Lord alluded to the loss of the "Selworthy." I confess that
<col>1016</col>
I was not familiar with that case, but I will bring the noble Lord's remarks to the notice of my right hon. friend. The noble Lord behind me (Lord Brassey) pointed out, quite truly, that the whole principle of marine insurance rests upon the fact that it is in its essence a contract of indemnity. That is a matter which ought never to be lost sight of, and which I am sure the Legislature never will lose sight of in dealing with this question. I quite agree with what my noble friend said, that it would probably be a very useful precedent to any action which may be deemed to be desirable that counsel should be taken with foreign countries in regard to their law of insurance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02280"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite certain that my noble and gallant friend who sits behind me will be at any rate satisfied with the very sympathetic manner in which the noble Lord who represents the Board of Trade in your Lordships' House has replied to his Question, but I am not sure that the noble Lord went much further than a sympathetic reply. He says that the Board of Trade are keeping a watchful eye on this question. No doubt they have been keeping a watchful eye on the question for the last quarter of a century, since my right hon. friend Mr. Chamberlain introduced his Bill in 1884; but I cannot help thinking that probably some conclusions have emerged from that long consideration of the subject. I do not think that the noble Lord himself communicated to your Lordships quite fully what the result of those considerations must have been. He told us that the Government were not prepared to legislate on the subject but were considering it. That is what we may call a sealed pattern reply. I do not, of course, complain of it for a moment, but it does not carry us very much further.<lb/>
The case stands thus after this evening's discussion, that a very strong number of facts&#x2014;not merely theories, but hard substantial facts&#x2014;have been brought before your Lordships. My noble friend behind me had chapter and verse for everything he said. Then there was the very wide experience of the noble Lord opposite (Lord Brassey) and the most interesting instance which he gave out of his own experience of a ship which he had met in his maritime career and which was one of the offending ships. Not only was there
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0534"/>
<col>1017</col>
evidence of its unseaworthy condition, but as a matter of fact the ship went down. Those are the sort of facts which the Board of Trade have been considering for twenty-five years. Now what are the arguments against legislation on this subject? The noble Lord did not tell us. What is it which makes the Board of Trade hesitate? That is what I should have liked him to tell your Lordships. It may be that the subject has two sides to it; it may be that there are difficulties with which your Lordships are not familiar; but if the noble Lord could have communicated them to the House, I am sure it would have given very great relief and satisfaction, because although to be told that nothing can be done is in one sense unsatisfactory, yet it relieves your Lordships from responsibility in the matter.<lb/>
We should like to know what opinion the Board of Trade have formed of the prevalence of this over-insurance of unseaworthy ships. Is it done on a large scale? That would be one most important fact for us to know. The next is, if this is done on a large scale, whether there are any real difficulties in legislating on the subject. There is one direction in which I can give assurance to the Government. If on their responsibility they think it right to deal with the subject, I can assure the noble Lord that it will not be treated in a Party spirit either in this House or in another place. The lives of our seamen are too valuable for any proceeding of that kind. The noble Lord may take it for granted that if the Government think it right to legislate, their action would be treated in a perfectly fair spirit, in order that we may do the best we can for these men and the great service to which they belong.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02299"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I wish to ask the noble Lord a question with regard to this clause. I do not think it is within the competence of this House to alter it, but I want to point out what appears to me to be rather an injustice to a policeman who is called out to serve in the Army Reserve or Naval Reserve. The clause says that where a constable has been called into actual service as a member of any Royal Naval Reserve force or has been called out for permanent service as a member of the Army Reserve, his period of service under that proclamation may, "if the police authority think fit," be reckoned in the computation of approved service. Looking at it entirely from the policeman's point of view, it is surely rather a hard thing that if he is called out to serve his country that service need not necessarily count towards his pension. I dare say that those who have prepared this Bill may take the view that they do not wish to put compulsion on local authorities to expend the rates which those authorities have to raise. There is a good deal in that, but on a great many much more important occasions the Government pay no attention to that doctrine&#x2014;such, for instance, as improvement schemes and large matters of that sort&#x2014;and having swallowed so many camels I do not see why they should strain at this particular gnat. Looking at it from the policeman's point of view, it is very hard that, whereas if he remained serving in the police force he would be counting his time towards pension, when he is called out to serve his country he may not be allowed to count that time in his service. There is this objection to it, that he is serving the Government, and surely the Government when a policeman is serving them ought themselves to be responsible for any payment which he is earning in the way of pension whilst
<col>1020</col>
serving in that capacity. This House cannot alter this clause, but it seems to me that it is a great hardship on the policeman.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02300"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: I may, perhaps, point out to the noble Earl that the object of this Bill is simply to assimilate the position in Scotland to that in England. If he will look at Section 4 of the English Police Act of 1906 he will find that the words "if the police authority think fit" also appear there. That is one of the reasons. But I am given to understand that there is also another reason. There maybe cases&#x2014;I do not think they will be many&#x2014;in which a man may be earning a pension while serving as a Reservist, and it is in order to meet those cases, if they were to occur, that this facility is given. I need hardly say that I cannot conceive that any police authority in Scotland would make use of this provision for the purpose of withholding a pension when one of their officers is called out on national service to perform a public duty. I hope this explanation will satisfy the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>1.&#x2014;(1) The police authority of any county or borough in England or Wales as respects which this Act is for the time being in force shall make such arrangements as to the hours of duty of constables that every constable (not being above the rank of inspector) shall be allowed at least fifty-two days in a year on which he is not required to perform police duty, save on occasions of public emergency, and for such days being distributed throughout the year with the object of securing, so far as practicable, to every such constable one day's rest in every seven.</quote>

<quote>(2) This Act shall not come into force as respects any police authority until such date as may be fixed by the authority, but if this Act has not come into force as respects any police authority on the expiration of four years from the passing of this Act, His Majesty may direct by Order in Council that it shall come into force at the expiration of such period as may be fixed by the Order, and this Act shall come into force
<col>1026</col>
accordingly: Provided that before any Order in Council is made under this Act the draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament and if an Address is presented to His Majesty against the draft or any part thereof by either House of Parliament within the next subsequent thirty days on which that House has sat next after any such draft is laid before it no further proceedings shall be taken thereon without prejudice to the making of any new draft order.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02348">He also proposed to add the following new subsection&#x2014;
<quote>(3) An Order in Council under this Act may apply either to all police authorities generally in respect of which this Act has not come into force or to any authority specified in the Order.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02349">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I think I had better say a few words to explain the scope and the exact intention of my Amendment. It probably might be, for the purposes of an Amendment, divided into two. The first part deals with the question of the four years. As the Bill stands, the Act will come into compulsory operation in every county borough maintaining a separate police force at the expiration of four years after the passing of the Act, while with regard to other authorities, including all the large counties, the time for it to come into operation is to be fixed by an Order in Council. There is no limit put on the time when that Order in Council may be first enforced, and therefore the object of my first Amendment is to say that the Order in Council shall not be issued until the same period&#x2014;namely, after the expiration of four years. The provision as to the expiration of four years will apply to every Police Force, and if, as I believe, the intention was to give a certain latitude with regard to counties, whose case has not been properly considered before the Committee, I think it would be obvious that it would be a hardship upon them if an Order in Council were issued the moment the Bill passed, without the same limit of time as is given to county boroughs. That is the intention of the first part of my Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02350">With regard to the second part of the Amendment I must say a few words, because it seems to me that the discussion, which was not a long one, on the Second Reading did not sufficiently point out that the case of the counties and also of some of the smaller boroughs had not at all been considered by the Committee which sat upon the Bill in the House of Lords. But as far as it was considered, they made a very great distinction between the two
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0539"/>
<col>1027</col>
cases. In their report the Committee stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"It will be admitted that little or no comparison is possible between the daily life of a police constable on duty in the heart of the metropolis and that of a constable stationed in a sparsely inhabited rural district, more or less free from crime or any approach to disorder."</quote>
That was exactly our case on the Second Reading&#x2014;that they were not on all fours at all, and that the life of a policeman who is posted in a rural district is not at all to be compared with that of a man who is amongst a very large population and exposed to very disagreeable and dangerous work. The Committee went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"As a matter of fact, the figures given in evidence as to health in the Police Force show a marked improvement. Your Committee are not able to find that the question of one day's rest in seven has been at all widely or generally raised or discussed by those affected by, or responsible for, the cost&#x2014;namely, the ratepayers and their elected representatives.</quote>
The Committee continued&#x2014;
<quote>"Having regard to these and other facts and circumstances which might be mentioned, your Committee do not recommend at present the enactment of the Bill which has been referred to them, applying as it does to the whole of England and Wales."</quote>
Considering that that comes from the Committee who recommend the Bill as far as London goes, I think one would not have been altogether unreasonable if one had taken exception to the Bill referring to the counties, and also, possibly, to some of the other boroughs. But the Bill having passed the other House, and having met with unanimous support there, it is very difficult at this stage to limit its scope; but I do think that it is only a very moderate and reasonable proposal which I make with regard to this Amendment&#x2014;namely, that in each case where an Order in Council is issued it should be submitted to the House for consideration before it actually takes effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02351">The wording of this Amendment has been carefully considered. The difficulty as to Parliament over-riding an Order made by the King in Council can only be got over in the way suggested&#x2014;that is, that before the Order is made a draft of it should be laid on the Table of the House. That is what my Amendment proposes. In the latter part of my Amendment I suggest that if an Address is presented to His
<col>1028</col>
Majesty against the draft or any part thereof by either House of Parliament within the next subsequent thirty days on which that House has sat next after any such draft is laid before it, no further proceedings should be taken thereon, without prejudice to the making of any new draft Order. I should like to point out that, although I have addressed my remarks principally with regard to the counties, whose case I am more conversant with and whose case I represent, as far as my Amendment goes this provision that the Order in Council shall lie on the Table for thirty days applies not only to counties but also to boroughs. There are a great many boroughs, I do not say in the same position as counties, but at all events in a different position from London, and I have thought it desirable in the first instance to make it applicable to the whole of these, and it is in that form that I move my Amendment. I think I ought to point out that the words I have quoted from the Report do not refer merely to the counties, although I think the case is stronger in the counties, but to all the other boroughs outside London, and that the recommendation of the Committee was with regard to London only.</p>

<image src="S5LV0005P0I0540"/>
<col>1029</col>
part which deals with the Order in Council being laid before each House of Parliament. To that His Majesty's Government offer no objection, and they would be glad if the noble Viscount who is in charge of the Bill sees his way to adopt it. But with regard to the other part, to which I think the noble Lord did not devote quite so much attention, I hope I may be allowed to say a few words in explaining why it is that we see some objection to the adoption of the first part of the Amendment. Your Lordships will see that the noble Viscount deals differently in the Bill with county boroughs from other police authorities. In the first part of the second subsection county boroughs are dealt with first of all, and then, in line 22, "any other police authority." That is to say, the promoters of the Bill have recognised that a different set of circumstances exists in the large county boroughs from that which exists in county areas and also in smaller boroughs. Whenever we have a Bill dealing with local government in this House it is almost without exception that we hear from some noble Lord that we should recognise the difference between the different sets of circumstances, and that we should not try to make one rigid law applicable to both. That was the intention of the noble Viscount and the promoters of the Bill&#x2014;namely, to make some distinction between the large boroughs and other police authorities, and that is the distinction with which the noble Lord who moves the Amendment really does away. He proposes that they should be dealt with in exactly the same manner. The reason why the promoters introduced this difference in regard to the police force in the large boroughs and the police force in other areas was that their experience in London led them to believe that it takes some time to get the increased number of police necessary in order to give effect to this Bill. It is very undesirable suddenly to have a large number of recruits in any police force, and from experience in London the promoters are inclined to think four years the proper period to give the large county boroughs in order that they may get the necessary number of recruits to be able to carry the Bill into effect. The result of the noble Lord's Amendment is, in the first place, to sweep away the difference between the county boroughs and the other areas, and, in the second place, he does not make it compulsory, as the Bill does, upon the county boroughs.</membercontribution></p>

I think your Lordships will see, under the general interpretation, that the word "may" is permissive, and makes some difference in the phraseology of the Bill as it stands at this moment. I think, if the noble Lord will look at the Bill and consider the effect of his Amendment, he will see that it takes away, so far as county boroughs are concerned, the compulsion provided for. That really is one of the reasons why His Majesty's Government would be unwilling to see this part of the noble Lord's Amendment adopted. In their opinion this different treatment of county boroughs is really necessary. I do not know that in the debate which took place on the Second Reading any very strong objection was taken to this point in the House; and, in view of the larger opportunities for objection which will be allowed by accepting the second part of the noble Lord's Amendment and making it necessary that the draft Order should be laid before your Lordships' House, I venture to hope that we may be able to come to a general agreement on the subject. There will be certain verbal Amendments necessary, but with those I shall not venture to trouble your Lordships until I know whether the suggestions which I venture to make are generally acceptable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02358"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope, on behalf of the promoters of this Bill, that the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment will be content with the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0541"/>
<col>1031</col>
second portion of it. As regards that portion, I may say that it was distinctly understood by the framers of the Bill that there were different circumstances in county boroughs and in counties, and for that reason there appeared in the Bill a different practice as regards those different areas. When the noble Lord asks that as regards the counties, which may be dealt with by an Order in Council, there should be the fullest opportunity for Parliament to revise and discuss that Order in Council, I venture to say I consider that a great improvement on the Bill and a proper provision to be inserted in it. In fact, I think I committed an error towards this House in not explaining more fully on Second Reading the difference in practice which it was proposed to adopt in the Bill. But as regards the other portion of the Amendment, it seems to me that it is nugatory of the intention of the Bill, which is that within four years this provision should come into force in county boroughs. After what has fallen from the noble Earl who represents the Home Office, I trust that the noble Lord who has moved the Amendment will content himself with that important part of it which provides that Parliament should have the revision of the Order in Council, and that he will not, by insisting on the first portion of his Amendment, render the Bill practically nugatory in a large number of important boroughs in this kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02359"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the Second Reading I ventured to enter a protest against the manner in which the payment was going to be taken from local authorities to meet the expenses of this Bill. I did so on behalf of a very important borough, and I appeal to my noble friend who has moved this Amendment to insist upon boroughs being included within the procedure he proposes to adopt. It would give county boroughs an opportunity of stating their case the same as counties, and if they fail to make out their case it will be open to the Government of the day to place compulsion upon them. I earnestly hope that the Government will see their way to give boroughs the same opportunity that they are going to give to counties. In the first place, the great boroughs are not being consulted, and if they were canvassed I am confident that it would be found that there is considerable opposition to this Bill. Very few of those authorities know what the effect of the Bill
<col>1032</col>
will be. It was only yesterday that this matter was mentioned before the Standing Joint Committee of my own county, and I was surprised to find how very few people had ascertained what the effect of it would be. In view of the fact that the result of this Bill has not been thoroughly grasped by those who represent the ratepayers up and down the country, I hope Government will be good enough to allow county boroughs the same opportunity as counties, which would be the result of carrying the other part of my noble friend's Amendment. I hope my noble friend will stick to his Amendment as it stands. Every local authority will then have the opportunity of having their case properly stated in Parliament before compulsion is put upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02360"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid I am very obtuse, but I listened with great attention to the speeches of the noble Earl opposite and of my noble friend on my right (Viscount Ridley) and I fail to understand why they desire a different treatment for boroughs from that to be meted out to counties. The noble Earl opposite told us that it is necessary in a borough&#x2014;apparently he is advised that it is not necessary in a county&#x2014;that four years should elapse before a sufficient number of new police could be obtained in order to allow the remaining members of the force to have one day's rest in seven. That I can quite understand, and there is nothing as far as I see in the noble Lord's Amendment which deprives them of that four years. The noble Earl went on to say that the Amendment did away with compulsion, but neither Lord Ridley nor the noble Earl opposite told us why compulsion is necessary in the case of boroughs when it is not necessary in the case of counties. Again I should like to emphasise what fell from my noble friend Lord Belper, that the Committee which had the whole of this subject under consideration drew a clear distinction between the metropolis and other places, including large boroughs, and by doing so they distinctly left the inference upon their Report that they did not think that it was necessary, or that the time had come, for other authorities than the metropolis to be forced to carry this provision into effect. The counties are to have four years warning that they are liable to an Order in Council forcing them to come under the provisions of this Bill,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0542"/>
<col>1033</col>
and then, after those four years have expired, the Order in Council is to be laid before the House. Why are the boroughs not to have the protection which is demanded, and which I am glad the noble Earl is willing to give, in the case of the counties&#x2014;namely, that each particular case should have the opportunity of being considered by this House before this compulsion, which the Committee who have inquired into the question have not recommended and which is simply the invention of a certain number of private Members of the House of Commons, is forced upon them. I do hope we shall insist on this Amendment. It is quite a reasonable one, and I fail at the present moment to see why the noble Viscount thinks it makes the provisions of the Bill so far as boroughs are concerned nugatory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02361"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think some answer is necessary with regard to the remarks of the noble Earl opposite upon my Amendment. In the first place, let me say that in using the expression "His Majesty <i>may</i> direct by Order in Council" I have followed the universal form in Acts relating to Orders in Council. It would not be correct to say that His Majesty <i>shall</i> make an Order. This practically leaves it to the Government to make the Order in Council on the very day they desire to make it. As soon as the four years have elapsed they can make the Order in Council at once. Therefore as far as the question of the use of the word "may" is concerned there is nothing in it, because that is the usual form in Acts of Parliament. As regards the distinction between the large boroughs and the counties, I cannot see that the noble Earl made out his case. What are the facts? He says that the big boroughs, being large police authorities, would require more time to arrange for the extra police that might be required. But what are the figures that are given in this return? It appears that the distribution of the police is as follows&#x2014;in the metropolis, 17,258; in boroughs having their own police force, 18,713; and in counties, 17,038. No doubt some of these counties are very much smaller than others, but some are very much larger than the boroughs, and have very large police forces. And if it is necessary to give this period of four years latitude to a county borough, surely it is just as necessary in many counties to give ample time for the
<col>1034</col>
consideration of the matter. The fact is, distinction is being made without any case for it having been made out in the Report of this Committee. The Committee themselves say that the only distinction they can draw is between the police force in London and that in other parts of the country. I venture to say that it would be a rather strong action where no particular case had been made out to apply compulsory powers by the issue of an Order in Council at any moment directly the Act is passed, not giving even four years grace. I should strongly object to give way with regard to that, and so far as the distinction between counties and boroughs is concerned I cannot see that the noble Earl has made out a case which would justify their being treated in a totally different manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02362"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to find myself in agreement with Lord Belper on one point. I quite agree that I did not make out my case as to the distinction between county boroughs and smaller areas with regard to the Order in Council, a matter to which Lord Wenlock also referred. It had not been my intention to make any distinction in areas, because if the noble Lord will look at his own Amendment he will see that that part of it which we should be glad to accept says that "Provided that before any Order in Council is made under this Act the draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament." That covers all areas, county boroughs, county areas, and the smaller boroughs. There would not be any difference between them. With regard to the other part of the Amendment, may I venture to put forward another difficulty which might arise if we accept it. Supposing four years passed, and at the end of that time the county borough had made no preparation for adding to its number of police, and the draft Order directed a weekly rest-day to be given, there would have to be a further delay before there would be a sufficient number of police to allow the rest-day to be given. So that what would happen under the first part of the Amendment of the noble Lord would be that there would be, first, a delay of four years, and then there would be another delay of four years possibly before they would be able to get a sufficient number of police in order to give a weekly rest-day. That is a practical difficulty, and might inflict some hardship in
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0543"/>
<col>1035</col>
the case of the big county boroughs. I am glad to find that the noble Lord is anxious that this Order in Council should be made applicable to all these authorities, and being so far heartily in agreement with him I hope he will withdraw the other part of his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02363"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: The same difficulty would arise in the case of big counties as in the case of big boroughs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02364"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I agree; but would it not be different in degree?

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02365"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene with great reluctance, because I have not studied the question with the close attention that has been given to it by my noble friends. It seems to me that a very important concession has been offered to Lord Belper by the acceptance of the latter part of his Amendment&#x2014;that which requires these Orders in Council to lie on the Table of the House for a certain number of days. It is the case, no doubt, that that applies to all Orders in Council.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02367"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That disposes satisfactorily of a part, at any rate, of the proposal of my noble friend Lord Belper. With regard to the other part of his Amendment, I would venture to suggest that, in deference to the strong pressure which has been put upon him on the part of the Home Office, he should not press it at this moment, but should reserve to himself the right of bringing up words at a future stage if on further consideration he thinks that necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02368"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I confess I did not quite understand, what I now gather from the remarks of the noble Earl opposite, that the Order in Council refers to boroughs as well as to counties.

<col>1036</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02369"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: What I suggest is that the noble Lord should leave out the first part of his Amendment down to the word "accordingly," and should insert the remainder of it, commencing at the word "Provided," at the end of the subsection. I do not think there would be any doubt that that would refer to both kinds of authorities as it would be in the same section. If your Lordships agree to that I am informed that the proposed subsection (3) in the noble Lord's Amendment would not be necessary. That subsection really deals with the last two lines of the Bill on page 1. The words in the Bill are "The Order may apply either to all such other police authorities generally or to any authority specified in the Order." The words in the noble Lord's proposed subsection (3) are almost similar, and I think he only proposed to put them in because his Amendment as it stands on the Paper would have struck them out. If the noble Lord will be good enough to accept this at the present stage, he will have an opportunity before Report of looking into it and seeing whether he and his advisers are satisfied with the form which we propose. If not, we might discuss it on the Report stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02370"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: It does not seem to me that that would meet the case. I understand that the noble Earl wishes to leave out the words of my noble friend's Amendment down to the word "accordingly," and that the rest of the Amendment should come in at the end of the clause. The clause reads&#x2014;
<quote>"This Act shall not come into force as respects any police authority until such date as may be fixed by the authority, but if this Act has not come into force as respects the police authority of any county borough maintaining a separate police force before the expiration of four years from the passing of this Act, it shall come into force as respects that authority at the expiration of that period."</quote>
What is the good, after saying that, of adding at the end a proviso that the Order in Council should lie on the Table of Parliament for thirty days? No order would be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02371"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Duke will be content to wait until he sees in print the clause as amended, I think it will be satisfactory to him.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1037</col>
clear understanding that I shall be at liberty, when I see the words in print and on further consideration, to move an Amendment on Report if I think it desirable or necessary. The only point that I should still press is that I believe there are counties which have just as largo police forces as in boroughs, and I think they require time just as much as do the boroughs in which to make the arrangements before the Order in Council is issued. I do not see at present the distinction between a very large borough and a very large county with an equally large police force, and it may be necessary for me to meet that case at a later stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02459" align="center">[SECOND READING]</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02460">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02461"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it will not, I think, be necessary to occupy much of your Lordships' time over this little Bill, which your Lordships will see at once is as simple as it is necessary. It deals with and seeks to make less hideous the traffic in decrepit horses. The Board of Agriculture classifies these horses under two heads&#x2014;as of &#x00A3;5 and under, and as of &#x00A3;10 and under&#x2014;and the tables show that while Belgium and Holland import from this country some 40,000 between them, by far the greater number of the ten-pounders go to Belgium while by far the greater number of the five-pounders go to Holland. This at once stamps the traffic with Belgium as being far more vicious than that with Holland, because whereas the five-pounders&#x2014;in fact, all those which go to Holland&#x2014;are used entirely for food and are under police supervision from the moment of arrival until they are slaughtered, those which are landed at Antwerp are walked four miles to the Government stables to be examined
<col>1046</col>
for glanders and other diseases, and then either the last ounce of work is dragged out of the poor brutes in country labour, or they are consigned to the butcher, which often entails a further march of suffering.<lb/>
This Bill seeks to ensure the compulsory examination by a veterinary surgeon appointed by the Board of Agriculture for that purpose of every single horse on arrival at the dock, and to forbid the captain or master of any vessel accepting any horse for exportation unless a certificate from the veterinary surgeon is produced to the effect that the animal is capable of being conveyed to its destination without suffering, not only during the intended voyage but after being disembarked. In 1898, as a result of a deputation from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Exportation of Horses Order was issued, by the Board of Agriculture, and so far as it affects the horses when once on board ship, it has greatly tended to improve their condition. But the contention of the promoters of this. Bill&#x2014;and I hope to amply prove it to your Lordships&#x2014;is that unfit horses are actually shipped, and that the Order which says it shall not be lawful to convey in a vessel from any port in Great Britain any horse which, owing to age, infirmity, illness, injury, or any other reason, cannot be so conveyed without cruelty during the intended passage and on landing, is a dead letter.<lb/>
In proof of this, I would draw attention, first, to the fact that since 1902 the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has obtained 700 convictions against persons for travelling lame and decrepit horses on the road to the docks for shipment abroad, and I would suggest that these simple folk&#x2014;the horse dealers&#x2014;would not incur the trouble and expense of driving those horses from long distances to the port of exportation if they did not think there was a good chance of getting them on board. And, secondly, I would draw attention to the evidence of Mr. Smart, M.R.C.V.S., Superintending Veterinary Inspector of the Board of Agriculture, which he gave at the monthly meeting of the Veterinary Society on April 7 last. With your Lordships' permission I will read it. Mr. Smart said&#x2014;
<quote>"It had occurred to him that the society might like some clear indication from a veterinary
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0549"/>
<col>1047</col>
surgeon who was somewhat intimately acquainted with the traffic as to the conditions under which it had been carried out, and was now carried out&#x2026;.In February, 1909, he received instructions from the Assistant Secretary of the Board to visit all the ports to see exactly what the local authorities were doing as to administering the Exportation of Horses Order of 1898, and to report to the Board. The Exportation of Horses Order, 1898, provided for the proper treatment of horses <i>en route</i>, and left the duty of carrying out the provisions to the various local authorities. When that Order was first passed, it was assumed by the Board that the local authorities would place the inspection of the horses in the hands of veterinary surgeons, presumably their local inspectors. When he went to the various ports he found there was no uniformity in the way in which the order was being administered. At a few ports the veterinary inspector of the local authority was inspecting horses before shipment; at some of the other ports they were inspected on behalf of the shipping companies by a veterinary surgeon in the employment of the company; in other cases there was a comic opera sort of arrangement, by which the veterinary surgeon was paid a fee for inspecting the horses he passed fit for shipment but was not paid any fee for the horses he rejected as unfit for shipment; and at some other ports a perfunctory inspection was made by the police."</quote>
So far then, my Lords, we have dealt with the decrepit horse on this side of the water, and attempted to make certain that it shall not leave this country in a state of suffering. A further clause in the Bill provides that every ship engaged in this traffic shall carry a proper and humane killing instrument, and gives the master of the ship power to order its use to end the sufferings of any of his equine passengers without making himself pecuniarily liable. Again I will quote the evidence of Mr. Smart before the Veterinary Society. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board had received reports from time to time from their lay inspectors, who for several years past had occasionally made voyages on the ships with the object of seeing that the fittings of the ship were in order and that the animals were properly fed and watered on the voyage. These inspectors were allotted certain stations, where they remained for some years, and it was quite likely they became known to the persons engaged in the trade, and that during the particular voyage they were on board the horses were better attended to than at other times."</quote>
This is borne out by the evidence of the secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who with a <i>Daily Mail</i> correspondent travelled on one of these ships to Antwerp last February, and reported as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"No food or water was, so I was informed, to be given to the old horses unless desired. I took care to inquire on arrival if such a wish had been expressed by the dealers, and was told that
<col>1048</col>
none of these poor old animals had been either fed or watered on the passage."</quote>
Bearing those words in mind your Lordships will, perhaps, not be surprised to hear the following facts: 16,373 horses were exported to Antwerp between January, 1909, and January, 1910. Of these, 317 had to be removed on arrival in wagons; nine had to be killed at once; and forty-one arrived dead. When I remember a voyage which I made with the King's Dragoon Guards in 1879, taking many weeks, and that at the end of it the King's Dragoon Guards and 17th Lancers landed their horses practically intact at Durban and shortly after marched up country, I can only come to the conclusion that such casualties as I have read to your Lordships in the little voyage to Antwerp must mean that a large percentage of those horses would never have been shipped had they been subjected to a proper veterinary examination, and that, if shipped, many would have been destroyed on the voyage to avoid suffering but for the Belgian law of 1895, which loses to the consignor the value of an animal killed <i>en route</i>.<lb/>
Once more I must draw on Mr. Smart. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board also received information that horses not in a fit condition to endure the voyage were shipped from time to time, and some rather disquieting information as to the treatment of horses on the other side was also brought to the notice of the Board."</quote>
Disquieting information, indeed, my Lords, because the Secretary of the Society who, with the <i>Daily Mail</i> correspondent, went to Antwerp, reports as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"We saw horses with such deformities and diseases that it was gross cruelty to have allowed them to undergo the sufferings entailed by the journey&#x2014;horses which were so lame that on arrival they could hardly hobble along the dock side, and had to be conveyed to the Government stables in wagons, or were so weak that they had to be sandwiched between two less decrepit animals so that they might receive their support during the painful walk of four and a-half miles to the Government stables."</quote>
Your Lordships may say, with so much cruelty on foot, Why are these horses not either killed before embarkation or the traffic stopped altogether? The first of those is not possible, because Belgium and Holland do not allow dead meat across their borders; and the second is an unattainable ideal, not practicable because a large amount of money is involved in this trade and the supply in this country
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0550"/>
<col>1049</col>
meets the demand of Holland and Belgium. Therefore I feel that we must be content with the provisions of this little Bill. It has come from another place practically with unanimous approval, and I ask your Lordships to give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02462">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Saye and Sele.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02463"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think there are any of your Lordships who will not be in general agreement with the principle of this Bill. Certainly I am myself, and nothing that I shall say and no Amendment that I shall move can be taken as being against the principle as a whole. But it seems to me that the Bill is too general in its application. We admit at once that there are abuses, but this seems like employing a steam hammer to crack a nut. In trying to stop admitted abuses you are going to interfere with the legitimate horse trade of the United Kingdom. We want to stop the abuses of which the noble Lord has spoken, but I think he will agree that we should do nothing to stop the legitimate horse traffic between this country and the Continent. Naturally I shall not oppose the Second Reading of the Bill, but there are one or two Amendments which I shall move in Committee, and which I hope the noble Lord will see his way to accept.<lb/>
I will take, in the first place, Clause 1, in which appear the words&#x2014;
<quote>"Except in such cases as may be prescribed by Order of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries."</quote>
Great as is my admiration for that Board and its President, I would infinitely prefer to have the powers which the Board are to exercise more clearly defined in the Bill. We then come to the words&#x2014;
<quote>"From any port in Great Britain to any place outside Great Britain."</quote>
I do not think the noble Lord would wish that the restrictions which he rightly desires to impose in the case of the traffic between England and Holland and Belgium should be imposed in the same way in the case of the trade between England and Ireland. The two are on different footings, and restrictions which would rightly apply to the one ought not to apply to the other. I shall, therefore, when the Bill reaches Committee, move to leave out the words "Great Britain" and to insert "British Isles." Next there is the word "immediately" ["unless immediately before shipment
<col>1050</col>
the horse has been examined by a veterinary surgeon appointed by the Board"]. This seems to me far too indefinite, and I should like to propose, when the time comes, that instead of the word "immediately" there should be substituted the words "within forty-eight hours." Clause 2 I confess I do not understand at all, but we shall probably get some information upon it in Committee. When we come to Clause 3, there is a much more serious restriction on the exportation and importation of horses. In the first place, I should propose to leave out the words "during the voyage" and to substitute the words "while on board," because it might be very difficult to prove that a horse was injured during the voyage, whereas it would be perfectly easy to prove that it was injured "while on board."<lb/>
But the biggest controversy I have with this Bill is that every class of horse is included. I propose, by a new clause which I will place on the Paper, to exclude that class of horse with which, perhaps, I am more intimately concerned than with any other&#x2014;the racehorse. The rule that applies in the case of a decrepit horse ought not to apply in the case of a racehorse. Let me give your Lordships one instance. It would be prefectly easy for a racehorse or brood mare going abroad to split a pastern on board. The master of the vessel has no veterinary knowledge, but he sees that the animal is quite lame and has apparently broken a limb. Under this Bill he could destroy that animal at once, without any compensation to the owner. An animal which had split a pastern, although not so valuable for racing purposes, is quite as valuable for breeding purposes. Therefore I should propose to exclude entirely from the provisions of this Bill any horse sent abroad <i>bona fide</i> for racing purposes, or any horse that may come from abroad to England and return after racing. I should exclude also all brood mares going abroad, requiring in each instance that there should be given to them a certificate on behalf of the ruling authority of the turf&#x2014;the Jockey Club&#x2014;to the effect that they were going abroad for genuine racing purposes or purposes connected with racing. If the noble Lord can see his way to insert such provisions as I have mentioned in the Bill, from the point of view of racehorse owners I see no objection to it, and I should be prepared to give the Bill otherwise my most hearty support.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1051</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02464"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I may be allowed to congratulate the noble Lord opposite on the introduction of this Bill, the effect of which, in my opinion, will be entirely to stop this traffic in decrepit horses, of which we have read so much lately in the newspapers. This traffic is a disgrace, and it is positively cruel. If the Belgian and Dutch people want horse flesh to eat, we can provide them with that food, but it need not entail any cruelty whatever on this or on the other side of the water. As the noble Lord said, Dutchmen eat these decrepit horses at once. I mean that they are slaughtered at the port of entry. The Belgians, on the other hand, if there is any work left in these old and decrepit animals, take them into the interior of the country and work them as long as they can last. That, in my opinion and I am sure in the opinion of your Lordships generally, is excessively cruel.<lb/>
It is dreadful to reflect that this country is responsible for all this. We are responsible for every bit of this traffic that has been going on for many years now, and for every bit of suffering that these old horses have had inflicted upon them, because there has not been stringent legislation to stop their being sent in this disgraceful state to the Continent. The only people who will not rejoice at the passing of this Bill are those callous ruffians who drive the halt and the lame of the horse world to our ports and ship them abroad. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals must be delighted at the passage of this Bill through the House of Commons without any word of opposition. The Society, I may say, have had no difficulty with regard to this traffic at the Port of London, because London magistrates have dealt in the most stringent manner with offenders. Let me give one instance. A butcher from abroad&#x2014;he came from Antwerp, I think&#x2014;was caught driving one of these horses through the London streets. The horse was in such a condition that it was slaughtered at once. The man was summoned, and was sentenced to a month's imprisonment without the option of a fine. I read the account in <i>The Times</i>, and it was stated that he wept on being sentenced and said his wife and children would suffer because he would not be able to carry on this traffic. I should like to know, if the old and miserable horse could have spoken, like Balam's ass did, what he would have
<col>1052</col>
said. In other ports magistrates who have had to deal with this question have not been so stringent as the London magistrates. The consequence is that the traffic has gone on, and is going on at this moment.<lb/>
The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, when I had the honour of speaking to your Lordships before on this subject, announced the appointment of a veterinary inspector, but it is quite impossible that one single inspector can deal with all the ports in Great Britain. What is more, this traffic is carried on in what I may call a sneaking sort of way. That is to say, on dark winter nights these horses are collected together and driven along the roads and put on board ship without anybody finding it out, and they arrive at their destination in a condition which is really a disgrace and a shame to this country. In my opinion the great point in the Bill is contained in Clause 1. I refer to the prohibition of the exportation of unfit horses and the appointment of veterinary surgeons to examine them, and the further provision that the expenses are to be borne by the owners of the horses. I think that is an excellent provision, and I am sure your Lordships will pass it without any amendment. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture has always said that there is difficulty with regard to funds, but here it is provided that the people who choose to export these wretched horses shall themselves pay for the veterinary inspection, and that will, I am sure, have a very deterrent effect upon these ruffians. I need not say anything with regard to the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Derby, because I am perfectly certain that a certificate from the Jockey Club would be quite sufficient to prove that the horse was a racehorse sent abroad for purposes connected with racing; and with regard to brood mares and any accident that might happen to them while on board, there would be no difficulty, I think, in introducing an Amendment on that subject to prevent confusion. I congratulate the noble Lord again on the introduction of this Bill, and I hope your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02465"><member>LORD SHUTTLEWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether any members of your Lordships' House have had the painful experience which I happen to have had of seeing the embarkation of some of these
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0552"/>
<col>1053</col>
horses to the Continent. A public duty took me to Hull two years ago. I had just landed from the steamboat and was walking along the docks when I witnessed the most shocking sight I ever saw in my life. A number of these horses were being put on board ship. One was in a terrible state, so bad that I can scarcely describe it to your Lordships. Among other things I may mention that one of its forelegs was enormously enlarged and was about the size of its neck. This horse, I was told, and the other horses were being put on board for the purpose of being transported across the North Sea to a port in Belgium or Holland, I forget which, to provide food for some of our neighbours across the water. I do not know what the authorities had been doing, but any person of authority at Hull, seeing what I saw, certainly ought to have been armed with powers to prevent embarkation. I congratulate my noble friend on having brought this Bill forward, and I am quite sure, whatever Amendments it may need, that the House will unanimously wish that it should be passed into law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02466"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to associate myself entirely with the expressions of sympathy with decrepit horses which have just been uttered by the noble Lord, and I should like to assure noble Lords opposite, with great respect, that if they showed the same sympathy to the victims of cattle-driving in Ireland they would receive an equal measure of gratitude. I do not know what line it is that undertakes this very unscrupulous traffic in dumb animals which are in such a deplorable condition, but it seems to me that responsibility lies at that door almost as much as it does with the perhaps thoughtless and ignorant people who are responsible for the shipment of horses in the first instance. A good many horses go from the part of the world where I come from to be eaten by the Belgians. Therefore I shall certainly support this Bill and do the best I can to make it a success. I have always ventured to think that the right, legitimate, and honourable end of a horse was to be eaten by the hounds. Still, if the Belgians prefer to eat the horses that we cannot finish up, we certainly ought to see that no cruelty is experienced in shipping them to that country.<lb/>
I have a suggestion to make. It has been abundantly proved that there is a considerable
<col>1054</col>
traffic in horses which are not fit to stand the journey, and upon which the infliction of the journey involves very great cruelty. It is therefore proposed to put an end to this by having veterinary inspection of these horses at the port of embarkation. If you are going to have veterinary inspection there, that presupposes the idea, which is perfectly well founded, that somebody or other will yield to the temptation to send to the port horses that are not in a fit state. I therefore suggest that between now and the Committee stage some machinery should be devised by the noble Lord whereby the onus of producing the certificate should be placed upon the owner of the horse in his own home, so that the animal should not be put to the pain of the journey from, say, Birmingham to Liverpool, or from any other place inland to the port from which it is going to be shipped. If you were to stop this traffic at its source you would absolutely shut down the possibility of any unfit horse having to undergo a journey on the road from its home to the port of embarkation. I venture with every respect to make this suggestion to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02467"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the object of the Bill now before the House I need hardly say that the Government entirely agree, and it is very satisfactory to the Government to see the great interest that is taken on both sides of the House in this question. I am in complete agreement with the noble Earl, Lord Derby, that there should be no interference at all with the legitimate horse trade of this country or with the traffic between England and Ireland. I also entirely agree that the rule applying to decrepit horses should not apply to racehorses. It would be, of course, a want of common sense to inspect and to vet Lemberg when he was going over to run for the Grand Prix, and to put a permit round the neck of a horse of that description. The noble Earl was quite right when he pointed out that it might be possible, as the Bill now stands, for an ignorant and stupid captain to destroy a valuable brood mare, racehorse, or carriage horse that was being taken abroad, because some trifling accident had happened. Such a valuable animal could very well be put in slings. I agree that that is a point that has been overlooked, but I do not think it would be very difficult to find words of some sort to meet this.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0553"/>
<col>1055</col>
The noble Earl, Lord Mayo, has taken great interest in this subject; everybody ought to be obliged to him for the good work he has done in this matter, and I think he must be very satisfied to see his efforts so near completion. As regards the experience&#x2014;the horrible experience&#x2014;of my noble friend behind me, Lord Shuttleworth, I hope that under the Order which is at present in force, as well as under this Bill, which I hope will become law, it will never be repeated. The House knows that the traffic in these decrepit horses is confined to certain ports. In Scotland the traffic is from Grangemouth and Leith, and in England it is from Newcastle, Hull, Goole, Grimsby, London, and a few from King's Lynn. Forty thousand horses are sent to Belgium and Holland annually. The port of Harwich does not export horses intended for slaughter, and I think from Harwich itself 5,000 horses are annually exported. In answer to Lord Willoughby de Broke, I think I ought, in common fairness, to say that we have reason to be grateful to the shipping companies, because they have always fallen in at once with any conditions that the Board of Agriculture have thought fit to impose upon them, and it is generally admitted by the public Press, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and on all sides that of late years there has been very little to complain of as to the way in which horses are carried at sea.<lb/>
The Government quite approve of the object of the Bill, but as it stands there are some administrative difficulties, though they are not serious, which could be removed by Amendments which I hope my noble friend behind me will see his way to accept. I am also glad to be able to say that this Bill on the whole runs on all fours with our Order of April 16 last, which I hope and believe has given general satisfaction. I welcome the Bill, and I hope that after the adoption of practical Amendments it will prove a satisfactory and final stoppage of this traffic, which I need hardly say has created great indignation in the public mind, and to deal with which very strong measures were needed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02468"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have only risen to say that I am very glad the noble Lord has introduced this Bill, because although the Orders of the Board of Agriculture to a considerable extent cover the ground, the Acts under which
<col>1056</col>
those Orders were issued were not designed to stop this particular sort of traffic. I think the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will agree with me that there are powers which the Board would be glad to use but which they cannot exercise because the general Act does not give them power to issue Orders in that direction. The country is indebted to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture for the steps which he has taken in that direction so far as his powers admitted, but I do not think they went far enough, and I therefore welcome this Bill because I believe it will be more efficacious than any Order of the Board of Agriculture.<lb/>
It has been suggested that the procedure is not quite the right one which ought to have been adopted, and that, instead of an inspector of the Board of Agriculture being made responsible for the fitness of the animal for shipment, the examination ought to be made, I think my noble friend Lord Willoughby said, at the source&#x2014;namely, upon the premises of the person shipping the horse. I suppose I am prejudiced from having had the honour of at one time occupying the position now filled by the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, but I venture to think there is much greater safeguard against abuse of this kind by entrusting these powers to an inspector of the Board of Agriculture than to an ordinary veterinary surgeon. Therefore I think the provisions of the Bill are preferable to the suggestion which fell from Lord Willoughby.<lb/>
I quite agree with the noble Earl that the great shipping companies have done all they could to mitigate the suffering which might be inflicted on these animals when they have found them consigned to their care, but I do not think that that is quite all that has to be done. I confess that I should like to have seen a clause in the Bill which would have imposed a penalty not only on the person who shipped the horse, but also on the carriers. That has proved most efficacious in the case of the Aliens Act in America. If a pauper alien taken on board a ship and conveyed to America is not allowed to land, and if he has been shipped under conditions under which he ought not to have been shipped, it is the shipping company which has to bear the expense, and I do not think it would be a bad thing if some penalty were imposed on the shipping company for any breach of this Bill. At any rate I welcome the Bill as a step in the right

direction and I think the noble Lord is to be congratulated on the general consensus of approval which his Bill has met with on all sides of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02469"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two things, I think, have emerged from this conversation. One is that the Bill has the general approval of the House so far as its principles&#x2014;principles which must commend themselves to all humane persons&#x2014;are concerned. The other, I think, is that the machinery of the Bill requires very careful examination before we can think of passing it into law as it stands. I rise merely for the purpose of expressing the hope that one suggestion which I shall venture to lay before the noble Lord opposite may be considered before the Bill is dealt with in Committee. I gather from the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture that this traffic in disabled horses is carried on at certain ports and at certain ports only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02470"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: That is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02471"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: If that is so, will it not be simpler and better that the Board over which the noble Earl presides should lay down regulations which can be made applicable to those particular ports at which the abuse is known to take place, rather than, as under the Bill, that the stringent procedure of Clause I should be made universally applicable to all ports and then that special exception should be made by the Board of Agriculture, in regard to certain places? I suggest that for the noble Earl's consideration. If that suggestion were to be adopted it would then be comparatively easy to appoint a veterinary surgeon at the particular ports from which these broken-down horses are shipped, and you would get over some of the difficulties which, I think, may arise in deputing Veterinary surgeons <i>ad hoc</i> for every particular case where a horse is moved. I hope the noble Lord who is in charge of the Bill will confer with the Department of Agriculture, and that we may have these matters considered before we are asked to proceed further with the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02472"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the observations of Lord Derby, I may say that if the noble Earl can frame an Amendment that will protect racehorses and brood mares while not jeopardising the case of the horses for whose benefit
<col>1058</col>
this Bill has been devised, I have no doubt the Amendment will be accepted. As to the Amendments foreshadowed by the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, he has not vouchsafed what they are, but I am generally in accord with him, and I expect his Amendments will be such as can be accepted by the promoters of the Bill. I will certainly adopt the suggestion of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and confer with the President of the Board of Agriculture upon the point to which the noble Marquess referred.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>LOCAL FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02474"><member>LORD BELPER</member> rose to move to resolve, That it is desirable that a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament be appointed to inquire into the application of the provisions contained in the Local Government Acts, 1888 and 1894, relating to financial adjustments consequent on the alteration of the boundaries of a local government area or on an alteration in the constitution or status of the governing body of a local government area, and to report to the House if they are of opinion that any amendments in such provisions are desirable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02475">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the Motion of which I have given notice I must admit that the question with which it deals is one of the most important which could be brought before the House, especially as regards local government, and that it has been for the last few years surrounded with difficulties. In those circumstances I confess I feel that it would have been of greater advantage if some member of this House of greater authority than myself could have brought forward this Motion. But the reason I have ventured to put it on the Paper is that I have been requested by the unanimous resolution of the County Councils Association to bring forward this question in your Lordships' House without delay. They feel that it is of such extreme importance that an attempted solution of it ought not to be deferred to any later period.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02476">I have no wish to take up the time of the House at any length, but I think it is due to your Lordships that I should attempt,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0555"/>
<col>1059</col>
as concisely and as clearly as I can, to point out what the present position with regard to these financial adjustments is and to make some case for the remedy which I propose. Going back to 1888, when the measure of local government was carried which effected a revolution in county government, it may be remembered that there were necessary provisions in that Act dealing with the financial arrangements arising out of the change brought about by the Act itself. Section 32 of that Act applied to adjustments of urban and rural districts, and it also applied to adjustments between county councils and county boroughs. This section, I think it must be recognised, was inserted for the purpose of providing that neither a county nor a borough should be placed in a worse financial position by reason of the clauses of the Act. That section specially set out that an equitable adjustment with regard to the matters referred to and also with regard to other financial arrangements should be come to, either by agreement or by the Commissioners appointed for the purpose. The section appointed Commissioners for this particular purpose, and gave them the widest possible powers with regard to the settlement and determination of such questions as should be referred to them. The section went on to say that this settlement and determination should be on such terms and in such manner as the Commissioners, in their absolute discretion, might think just and fit with regard to any matters referred to them, and also with regard to such other matters as in their judgment were incident thereto. It it impossible to conceive much wider powers than were given to the Commissioners by that section, and I think it is clear that the Act laid down that these matters should be settled by an equitable adjustment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02477">It will probably be within the remembrance of most members of this House that the late Lord Derby was appointed President of that Commission, and, acting under the powers that were given them, the Commission proceeded to adjudicate in all the questions between the county boroughs and the counties. For that purpose they had cases argued before them, and gave their decisions. I am very conversant with the matters which were referred to this Commission because it so happened that, owing to a change of officials in my county, I was the person in the county who
<col>1060</col>
knew, perhaps, more about the council's financial affairs than anyone else, and it fell to my lot to argue one of the first cases before the Commission with regard to the adjustment of the finances between my county and a county borough within the county. I may mention that the noble Lord whom I saw in his place a few minutes ago, Lord Eversley, sat as Chairman of the Commission on that day. I do not wish to enter into any details with regard to that; but let me say that those decisions which were given by the Commission not only settled matters between the counties and county boroughs for the time, but for a large number of years afterwards they were accepted unchallenged as the authoritative decisions with regard to the difficult financial matters which were laid before that Commission.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02478">But in 1907 this state of things was rudely disturbed. What was called the Hartlepool case, which was decided by the House of Lords, on appeal, entirely upset the decisions which for something like eighteen years had been accepted as recognised interpretations of the financial clauses of the Act of 1888. In the Hartlepool case it was held that when a new county borough is created by the separation of the borough from the county, the financial adjustment between the borough and the county does not include compensation for the loss of the contributing area. The decision rested, no doubt, on the wording of the Local Government Act. I understand that the expression "compensation" does not appear in those sections, and that the decision of the House of Lords, which overruled the previous decisions, turned on that point. It was held that an adjustment does not necessarily mean compensation, and that if the Legislature had intended it, it would have put it in perfectly clear language. I have not the slightest intention either of discussing, or in any way criticising, the Judicial decision of the House of Lords. Certainly this would not be the place to do it even if I so desired; but it is not at all necessary for my purpose.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02479">What I want to point out is that the effect of that decision was to absolutely upset all the interpretations of the law that had been accepted for this large number of years, and that while it upset the law as it stood, it put nothing in its place on which anybody could rely. From
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0556"/>
<col>1061</col>
that moment, therefore, the question of the financial arrangements between the counties and county boroughs was almost in a state of chaos. The state of the case was this. These decisions having been set aside, there was no power of getting an authoritative decision on this subject. The only way, in cases of extension of boroughs, in which a decision could be obtained was by bringing the matter before a Private Bill Committee, with the knowledge that the decision given by that Committee must be an uncertain one, and that the decision so given would settle nothing for the future. The result was that you had a state of things which made it imperative on every county authority whose county was being attacked by a borough wishing to make an extension to contest that case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02480">Within a very short time there were some important applications for extensions of borough boundaries. In 1908 the county borough of Manchester, the county borough of Blackburn, and the county borough of Burnley promoted Bills for the extension of their areas. There was a rather interesting discussion in the other House of Parliament with regard to one of those Bills&#x2014;I think it was the Blackburn Bill&#x2014;and in the course of that discussion it was proved that a serious state of things had arisen with regard to these financial arrangements between the counties and the county boroughs. It was shown that in many cases the decisions given by Committees were totally different in one case from another. I think with regard to those three Bills, which were before Parliament at the same moment, different decisions had been given concerning them; and in this House it was arranged that compensation on certain terms should be given in those three cases, the result being that the Bills were subsequently withdrawn. Is it possible to conceive any more unsatisfactory position for these large local bodies to be placed in than to be forced to spend a large sum of money in contesting cases; to have no chance of being able to rely that the decisions given, even if they were fair, would stand; and to feel that when the next Bill came forward a totally different decision would very likely be given?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02481">Let me quote the remarks of a gentleman who was in a position which enabled him to speak without being supposed to be a partisan on either side. Mr. Emmott, Chairman of Ways and Means, said that&#x2014;
<col>1062</col>
<quote>"In his opinion the question was so difficult that he thought the Local Government Board ought to give a lead to the House in this matter. If new legislation was required to settle the difficulty, it was for them to introduce it. If it could be settled in some way without legislation they should consider the question most carefully, so that when some other opportunity arose they would be prepared to advise the House upon it."</quote>
Then he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"There was one other reason why the matter should be settled. Since the decision of the House of Lords every administrative county council must, of necessity, oppose every extension of boroughs or urban districts, and surely it was desirable in the highest degree that such a cause of friction should be removed from our local government."</quote>
Those remarks were made two years ago, and precisely the same state of things exists at the present moment, although, perhaps, the position is a still more acute one from the fact that there are more important Bills being brought forward this year. I do not for a moment mean to say that last year was a year in which it would have been possible for the Government or anybody else to have got a solution of this question. The whole time of both Houses was occupied with the most important financial and constitutional matters, and the atmosphere of either House probably did not lend itself to the settlement of a difficult question like this on reasonable lines. But this year, again, there are three boroughs&#x2014;Birmingham, Bath, and Reading&#x2014;one of them one of the largest in the United Kingdom, proposing to enlarge their boundaries, and it seems that it is time that some steps should be taken to try and arrive at a solution of this question on reasonable and equitable lines, and on lines which might be acceptable as trying to do equity and fairness both to the boroughs and to the counties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02482">It was in those circumstances that I placed this Motion on the Paper some days ago, and I should like to call the attention of the House to the circumstances in which I was asked to move it. No doubt there is considerable excitement about some of the important Bills that are before the other House, especially the Birmingham Bill, and it has been suggested in the newspapers that in moving this Resolution I and other members of the County Councils Association were trying to use our influence on one side&#x2014;namely, against the Birmingham extension. Let me say that, as far as this Motion goes, it is moved in an absolutely non-contentious spirit. It was entirely
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0557"/>
<col>1063</col>
in that spirit that the County Councils Association asked me to move it. I will explain the origin of the Motion. The County Councils Association had a very important meeting some weeks ago with regard to these questions&#x2014;not only the extension question, but also the question of financial adjustments, which has reached such an acute stage. That meeting was attended by gentlemen and officials who probably knew more than any men in the country the past history of this matter, and who were thoroughly imbued with the necessity of its being settled on reasonable lines as soon as possible. After a very interesting discussion, a unanimous resolution was come to by the County Councils Association asking myself and another member of the association in the other House of Parliament to put this Motion on the Paper at once, in order that it might not be allowed to go over until it was too late, and until these other Bills might have reached a stage when it would be impossible to deal with this question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02483">That was the history of the Motion which I placed on the Paper in the first instance. It afterwards came before the Executive of the County Councils Association. The Executive confirmed the resolution, and especially asked that this Motion should not be mixed up in any way with any of the schemes before Parliament with regard to extension, but should be treated in an entirely non-contentious spirit with a desire to arrive at a solution which would be fair and equitable to all parties. I have ventured to explain that because I think it is important that it should be made clear that, whatever negotiations may have been going on between the parties to these Bills, neither I nor anybody concerned with this Motion have had anything to do with them whatever. I have probably said enough to make out a case for the appointment of a Joint Committee to see whether they cannot arrive at some authoritative decision with regard to the future of this difficult financial question. Let me say, with regard to my Motion, that our object was to make the reference as wide as possible and to include in it not only counties and county boroughs, not only urban and rural districts, but also any authorities which might, owing to the circumstances and the enlargement of their areas, be changing the <i>status</i> of local government. For instance, an urban district might be changed into a borough.</p>
<col>1064</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02484">I have specially avoided referring to particular cases which might come before this Committee, because it seems to me that if one refers to a case as an important one which must come before such a Committee for their decision, it might then be taken that there are not other cases of equal importance. Therefore it is much better to leave the Resolution in the terms in which it stands, referring to all financial adjustments. If the few remarks I have made commend themselves to the House as making out a case for this inquiry, I hope you will accept the Motion. But, more than all, I trust that I may hope to receive the support of the Government, without whose assistance such an important matter as this is not likely to be able to be brought to a satisfactory solution. It is my hope that whatever Committee should be appointed should be a strong Committee, not only for the purpose of dealing in the way suggested in the Motion with the difficult matters before them, but also, when they have come to a decision, to enable them to commend that decision to both Houses of Parliament; and if, by bringing forward this Motion in the imperfect manner I have done, I am able to make a first step, at all events, towards a settlement of this question, which has given rise to such serious difficulties with regard to local government, I shall be only too amply rewarded; and I am sure those who are interested in local government would be greatly satisfied if we could get this Joint Committee. I beg to move the. Motion which stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02485">Moved to resolve, That it is desirable that a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament be appointed to inquire into the application of the provisions contained in the Local Government Acts, 1888 and 1894, relating to financial adjustments consequent on the alteration of the boundaries of a local government area or on an alteration in the constitution or status of the governing body of a local government area, and to report to the House if they are of opinion that any amendments in such provisions are desirable.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Belper.</i>)</p>

Its only object is to enlarge the scope of the proposed inquiry by the Joint Committee so as to include Scotland. Exactly the same difficulties have occurred in Scotland, and it is at the unanimous request of the County Council of Lanarkshire, a large division of which I represented in the House of Commons for twenty years, that I urge the inclusion of Scotland within the scope of the Joint Committee's inquiry. The facts of the situation have been so well and so clearly put before your Lordships by my noble friend Lord Belper that I need not recapitulate them. I will only add that, as far as I am concerned and as far as Lanarkshire is concerned, we are taking action not because of any specific case, but on the broadest of broad grounds&#x2014;because of the general situation, which has become absolutely intolerable. I have reason to know that, at any rate in Scotland, both burgh authorities and county authorities would prefer almost any really definite principle, even if they did not absolutely approve of it, rather than the present condition of uncertainty, which gives rise to an enormous amount of absolutely useless but very expensive litigation.

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02488"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to express the hope that your Lordships will agree to the Motion which has been moved by Lord Belper, as well as to the Amendment of the noble Lord who has just sat down. The fact of the matter is, as I think the noble Lord in introducing the Motion to your Lordships mentioned, that a great change has come over the spirit of affairs owing to the Judicial decisions of your Lordships' House. When the Act of 1888 was passed it was thought that the word "adjustment" between county councils and boroughs, where the latter sought to extend their boundaries, meant compensation for loss of rateable value. The opposite view, however, was held by noble and learned Lords, not only in the case which has been referred to by my noble friend, the Hartlepool case, but also in an earlier case, the Godstone case. Although one of those cases was under Section 32 and the other under Section 62 of the Act of 1888, the principle
<col>1066</col>
was the same. It was decided&#x2014;the judgment was delivered by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack&#x2014;that the word "adjustment" would apply only to existing income, to some source of revenue which existed at the time of the extension of the boundary of the borough and not to any future or problematic increase. The result of that has been that, whenever a borough has come to Parliament to extend its boundaries, it has invariably been met by opposition on the part of the county council, and by a claim for compensation.<lb/>
In the case of the three Bills to which my noble friend referred&#x2014;the Burnley, Blackburn and Manchester Bills&#x2014;a Committee of the House of Commons inserted a clause in the Blackburn Bill providing for compensation, whereas other Committees of the House of Commons refused to insert such a clause in the Manchester and Burnley Bills. The consequence was that when the Blackburn Bill came under the discussion of the Whole House a Motion was made to expunge this clause so as to bring the three Bills into line and under similar conditions. The three Bills then came up to your Lordships' House, and were referred to a Committee under the Chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Donoughmore, and that Committee decided that it was right and just to insert a clause giving compensation in each of these three cases. What happened? The promotors said: "Oh, this is not what we want at all. We will drop our Bill, and come to Parliament next year, or the year after, when perhaps we shall find somebody with a tenderer heart than Lord Donoughmore." The result is that the thing has become a sort of gamble. These great corporations come to Parliament for one purpose or another, and they put in a clause extending their boundary in the hope that Parliament will not insert a compensation clause. If Parliament does put in a compensation clause, they drop the matter and introduce it again in a successive session.<lb/>
The real hardship is upon the adjoining areas, who must oppose these Bills under existing circumstances. Up to the time of the Judicial decision of your Lordships' House it was customary to have a friendly conference between the two authorities, and in nine cases out of ten a satisfactory arrangement was arrived at. In the present Parliament, in the case of a Bill
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0559"/>
<col>1067</col>
for the extension of the borough of Eastbourne, rather than enter into a bitter contest the borough of Eastbourne consented to the insertion of certain clauses which have entirely satisfied the surrounding district and the county of Sussex. I entirely approve of the suggestion made by my noble friend that a Joint Committee should be appointed, and that some guiding principles should be laid down so as not to leave the matter to the arbitrary decision of this or that Committee of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I also welcome the remarks which I understood the noble Lord to make in moving the Motion. I did not follow him, I am afraid, quite as closely as. I should have wished, but I welcome the observation which I think he made that the Motion was not conceived in view of the Bills which have been brought before Parliament in the present session. There are some very important Bills. The Birmingham Bill has been mentioned. Perhaps that is the most important one of all, and I must say I should not like to see any of these measures, upon which considerable sums of money have been spent and to which much Parliamentary time will be devoted&#x2014;I should not like to think that all that money and time would be wasted because a Motion might be made that the Bills should be postponed until this Joint Committee has reported and some legislation has taken place upon that Report. Therefore I hope, if His Majesty's Government agree to the appointment of this Joint Committee, that it will be on the understanding that it is not to interfere with the measures which are before Parliament in the present session. They may go on and be considered on their merits, and, of course, it will be open for Parliament hereafter to say, if they choose, that any general legislation which may be passed in a subsequent session shall be retrospective and embrace the measures which were before Parliament in the year 1910. If these are the principles on which my noble friend proposes the Resolution they have my hearty support.</membercontribution></p>

As the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees reminded your Lordships, we were fortunate in having all these three Bills before us, and, as the result of very exhaustive inquiry, we came to the conclusion&#x2014;I confess with some little hesitation on my part at the time, though as the result of subsequent inquiry I am now satisfied that our decision was correct, but with no hesitation whatever on the part of the other four members of the Committee&#x2014;to insert a clause which restored the position of affairs to that which obtained before the decision of your Lordships' House, sitting judicially, in the year 1907, a decision which I desire to speak of with the greatest respect, though I confess that from the point of view of justice it inspires very little respect. We did feel that the case, on the merits, was conclusively made out, and that where a borough takes out the cream of a county as far as rateable value is concerned and at the same time practically takes away none or few of the liabilities which still remain on the county rates, compensation should be given to the county.<lb/>
All that I need do in this connection is to mention two cases&#x2014;the case of one of the Bills that came before us, and a case that was quoted before my Committee. The difficulty arises mainly, I think, over the upkeep of roads, which, in a county like Lancashire certainly, are almost entirely used for traffic between the boroughs, and towards the upkeep of which the boroughs make no contribution. Had the Manchester Bill been passed in the form in which it came to us, six per cent of the rateable value would have been taken away from the Hundred concerned, and only one per cent of the roads. But a much more extreme instance might have arisen in the case of Blackpool if the decision of your Lordships' House had been given a good many years before it was
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0560"/>
<col>1069</col>
given. In the case of Blackpool forty-five per cent of the rateable value was taken away, but only two per cent of the roads; and it is obvious that very great injustice would have been done if compensation had not been paid in the peculiar circumstances of that case. I therefore desire to support the Motion of my noble friend below the Gangway. It is obviously desirable that some general rule should be reached which should act automatically in all cases of borough extension, of which we have many every session, and which I have no doubt will not diminish in number. In fact, if the Joint Committee should be successful in drafting a model clause which could be embodied in the Standing Orders of your Lordships' House, I am sure that decision would be very warmly received by everybody concerned, for it would lighten the work in the Committee-rooms upstairs and result in doing justice to many parties who at present feel very great doubt as to whether they will receive justice in cases in which they are interested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02491"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that owing to indisposition my noble friend who takes charge of local government business in this House is not able to be here to-day, but I am not sorry to have an opportunity of saying a word on this question, because I entirely realise the far-reaching importance which attaches to it, as was explained by my noble friend who introduced this Motion. Perhaps he will allow me to congratulate him upon having abstained altogether from importing any kind of prejudice into his argument. The subject is one which has aroused, as we all know, a great deal of feeling; and I am glad to have observed that in the debate generally the same note which was set by my noble friend opposite has been maintained. This question as to whether, when an alteration takes place in a local government area under the Acts, compensation should be payable for loss of rateable value, is, of course, in the strictest sense a vexed question, and the decisions which have been given by your Lordships sitting judicially upon it have undoubtedly caused a state of confusion in the Committee-rooms, to which attention was called by my noble friend the Lord Chairman, and on those grounds it certainly is desirable that we should attempt to arrive at some fair and authoritative opinion on the subject.<lb/>
<col>1070</col>
The case, as has been pointed out in debate, is somewhat complicated by the existence in Parliament of the three important Bills to which allusion has been made&#x2014;those dealing with Birmingham, Bath, and Reading; and I was particularly glad to observe, both from the speech of the noble Lord who introduced the Motion and also from the speech of the Lord Chairman, that there exists a distinct unwillingness to interfere with those Bills, although there is a desire that they should in their ultimate result be made subject to any general principle which is evolved. I was very glad to hear that, because, of course, it might have seemed to be a plausible argument to say that if a Joint Committee is going to sit to consider this whole question these Bills ought to be shelved. It is an argument of the kind which we often hear used, and in some cases with great plausibility. I am very glad, therefore, that it is agreed that a course of that kind would involve real hardship and unfairness to the parties, and that it is not desired that the progress of those Bills should be interfered with. I understand from my right hon. friend the President of the Local Government Board that the authorities of those three city and borough councils are quite willing that a clause should be inserted in their Bills, if they pass, to the effect that if the outcome of the inquiry by the Joint Committee should be to hold that compensation of this kind should be payable, their arrangements should then be subject to such a provision. I think your Lordships wilt agree that this seems fairly to meet the case, and that in agreeing to this proposal the great local authorities involved are showing a reasonable spirit.<lb/>
His Majesty's Government have, therefore, no hesitation in agreeing to the Motion of my noble friend opposite. And particularly in view of what I have just said about the existing Bills it is extremely important that the Joint Committee should be as strong a one as possible, and also that it should be&#x2014;and I think it is a subject on which an ideal might be attained&#x2014;of as far as possible an impartial character. It would be very undesirable that this should degenerate into a sort of tug-of-war between urban and county council interests, and therefore in suggesting the composition of the Joint Committee I am quite sure my right hon. friend will be fully alive to that aspect of the question, and will endeavour to make it as powerful
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0561"/>
<col>1071</col>
and representative a Committee as possible. I understand that my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland is quite willing to agree to the inclusion of Scotland in the Motion, on the general understanding to which I have already alluded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02492"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will you allow me to take this opportunity, for which I have been waiting for some time, to say a few words, not with regard to this particular difficulty, but by way of pointing a moral. The difficulty arose out of a decision of this House in 1907, and, however imperfect that decision may have been, it followed the decision of the House in the year 1904, which left us no alternative but to rule as we did. The point to which I wish to draw attention for a moment is this. The ground upon which I founded my opinion was that no other coherent interpretation of the language used could possibly be put upon it except that which was put upon it in 1904 and again in 1907. Although I do not say it was a fact, I strongly suspect that when the two parties who were quarrelling in this business came to settle the words in Parliament they were both content to accept ambiguous language in the hope that it would turn out to be interpreted in their favour. I am sorry to be obliged to inform your Lordships that this is not an isolated discovery. What is done is this. Each side think that they have a wiser and more skilful draftsman, and when they put up language which will bear one, or the other, or, indeed, no meaning&#x2014;I am speaking seriously, for sometimes a coherent meaning is very difficult&#x2014;then they come to the Courts of law and say that His Majesty's Judges and then this House sitting judicially are to find some path of escape. I hope that if a Joint Committee is appointed they will endeavour to select words which will be perfectly plain, so that they may be intelligible to the ordinary person, instead of being the subject of conundrums that are almost insoluble to the piercing intellects of His Majesty's Judges and to the more obtuse intellects that are to be discovered here.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE INCOME TAX.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02510"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether persons made subject to the payment of Income Tax by the Finance Act, 1909&#x2013;10 are still chargeable at the rate of ninepence only on the earned portion of their income when the total income is below &#x00A3;2,000, and, if so, what opportunity has been afforded to such persons for claiming relief since the Finance Bill became law, and why they have been informed that it is too late to claim to be charged at ninepence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02511">The noble Earl said: My Lords, a few days ago the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees raised a discussion in this House on the question of the Super-Tax return, with which I may say incidentally I am still struggling, somewhat assisted by a correspondence which has passed between him and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the course of that debate I ventured to put to my noble friend Lord Denman a question on another aspect of the Income Tax, which he very properly said he could not answer without notice. I have, therefore, put it on your Lordships' Paper for to-night. It refers to the payment of Income Tax at the lower rate of 9<i>d</i>. That rate, I believe, is still payable on the earned income of persons whose total income is below &#x00A3;2,000, and the question which I put was what opportunity had been afforded to such persons of claiming the relief to pay the 9<i>d</i>. Income Tax rate since the Finance Act, 1909&#x2013;10, became law. I suggested then that, so far as I could discover, the date before which they had to claim was September 30, 1909. That was a date at which the Finance Bill had not left the House of Commons, and a date six months anterior to that when it became law. I have not since discovered that they have had any opportunity of making this claim since the liability was imposed upon them by the passing of the Finance Act. I cannot believe that that is the intention of the Chancellor of the
<col>1074</col>
Exchequer, and I would ask the noble Lord what is the answer to the Question on the Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02512"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am much obliged to my noble friend for postponing his Question until this afternoon. As he is aware, a similar question was answered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in another place last week, but as the noble Earl has somewhat developed his case perhaps I may be allowed to go a little more into detail in the matter. The complaint of the noble Earl, as I understand it, is that although the Finance Act of 1909&#x2013;10 did not become law until April of this year, people with earned incomes of under &#x00A3;2,000 were obliged to put in a claim for relief before September 30 of last year, or, if they failed to put in a claim by that time, the relief was refused by the Inland Revenue. On the face of it, that may seem a hardship upon certain individuals, but I submit to your Lordships that as a matter of practice, with the possible exception of isolated cases, no real hardship has in fact occurred, because everybody knew last year that the Income Tax would be imposed sooner or later. Whatever happened to the other taxes or to the Budget itself, it was perfectly certain that sooner or later the Income Tax would be collected, and it was well known that the same relief would be granted as in previous years. As early as May of last year Form No.12, which provides space for inserting a claim for this relief, was issued to all those persons who were likely to be entitled to claim relief. They received that form, filled it up, and returned it as usual to the Inland Revenue by the specified date. There may have been cases where people did not receive that form. But I would suggest that the great majority of these professional gentlemen were well aware of the practice of the last few years, and I think it is very improbable that all those who have failed to make a claim have failed to do so because of the Budget not becoming law last year. I am informed by the Inland Revenue that ever since this arrangement has been in force&#x2014;namely, since 1907&#x2014;there have been a small number of applications for relief made each year after September 30, but in these cases relief has always been refused, and the Inland Revenue see no reason why, in the very few cases that have occurred this year, they should depart from the ordinary practice in the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1075</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02513"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Lord one or two questions on the statement he has just made. It appears, as I understand his answer, in the first place that I am correct in stating that although the liability was not imposed by law until April, 1910, the claims for relief should have been made before September 30, 1909. That incidentally seems to me a very strange constitutional doctrine to lay down. I do not know what the noble Lord means by talking about people being well acquainted with this practice, which only came into force in 1907. What does the noble Lord mean by saying "people are well aware"? Is it considered to be the business of the taxpayer to study, not the Statutes which impose taxation, but the debates in Parliament and discussions in the political arena, and to keep himself informed of what is said to be likely to come to pass? I have taken the opportunity of searching through the debates to see what statement at any time was made to the House of Commons that the persons entitled to pay at the 9<i>d</i>. rate would have to make their claims before the Finance Bill became law. I have been unable to find that any such public notice was given at any stage of the Bill in the other House by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and therefore I think people were legitimately entitled to assume that they could well wait until some legal obligation was imposed upon them before attending to the forms. At the time the forms were sent there was no statutory obligation to fill them up. I understand that these persons are to be penalised because they did not take the Budget as introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as the law of the land. I suggest that it is a novel doctrine to lay down that the taxpayer must take the Budget speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer as the law. It is farcical to say that under a Statute passed in April, 1910, relief must be claimed in September, 1909. I am unwilling to believe that the present Chancellor of the Exchequer really wishes to penalise people with small incomes, and instead of 9<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; to make them pay 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. on their earned incomes. The Treasury should have regard to the peculiar circumstances of last year and to the extreme hardship of this case. I hope that a more reasonable view will be taken of this matter, that these people will be given the same opportunity as has been extended to those entitled to the shilling
<col>1076</col>
scale&#x2014;namely, opportunity up to July 31 of this year to make their claim&#x2014;and that they will not be deprived of this relief by a not very creditable trick.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02514"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish it were possible for His Majesty's Government to pay attention to the remarks of my noble friend. The situation this year was a very remarkable one, and I think there is a good deal of reason for the arguments which my noble friend has addressed to the House. I quite agree from my experience in these matters with Lord Denman that in ordinary years probably little hardship occurs from the practice of the Department, but considering the very unusual condition of affairs last year I think there is some ground for asking the Treasury to exercise clemency in the matter. I only say this in the very peculiar circumstances of last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02515"><member>LORD JOICEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is an extraordinary thing to say that a return claiming a rebate must be made by a date long before the Government have any power to enforce payment of the tax, and I consider that this is a very dangerous precedent to set up. I trust that the Treasury will reconsider the matter and show some clemency, because, after all there are only a few persons who will not get the benefit of this rebate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02516"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to take exception to the doctrine which appears to be laid down that it is the duty of the public to find out beforehand from discussions in the other House what are likely to be the taxes imposed for the year. It has always been understood that as soon as a Bill became law the debates in the House of Commons and the promises made by Ministers were null and void, and that the only thing which lawyers could recognise was the enacting sections and not even the preamble to the Act. Therefore I do think it is rather hard in the case which the noble Earl has brought forward that these persons should have to suffer. I agree with Lord Welby that this is a matter in which the Treasury might act leniently, especially as the cases are so very few, and at any rate conform to what is generally known as the rule of law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02517"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no doubt that my noble friend Lord
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0564"/>
<col>1077</col>
Denman will convey to the Treasury the views which have been expressed by noble Lords in this discussion, but I am bound to say, although the noble Earl who introduced the subject pleaded his case with his usual skill, I cannot remain otherwise than unconvinced, and for this reason. Noble Lords who have spoken have seemed to imply that some obligation was placed upon these Income Tax payers to do something which they would not wish to do, almost, indeed, as though they had had to make some payment in the month of September although the payment might never fall due. But what they were asked to do by September last was to exercise a privilege, and whether the Budget passed or not it would do them no harm to have exercised that privilege. I should have thought that it was the most obvious course for any man to send in his form in the usual manner without reference to the political situation. My noble friend behind me has been accused of laying stress upon
<col>1078</col>
the reading of Parliamentary debates. It seems to me that the case is precisely the opposite. If these gentlemen, instead of wasting their time in studying the debates and attempting to prophecy the political situation, had attended to their own affairs and taken the ordinary step which they would have taken in any other year, and sent in their claim for relief, they would not have fallen into their present trouble. I am very sorry indeed that any people should suffer, even through their own fault. I believe, as my noble friend says, it is the fact, though it seems strange, that every year people of moderate income do not claim the rebate, and although I have no doubt my noble friend will make the proper representations to the Treasury I cannot feel that the case is quite so strong as some of my noble friends behind me seem to think.</membercontribution></p>

<title>POLICE (WEEKLY REST-DAY) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02546">Amendments <i>reported</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02547"><member>LORD BELPER</member> moved an Amendment placing the county authorities in the same position as county boroughs in the matter of receiving four years' notice after the passing of the Act in order to make their preparations to carry it out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02548">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I regret that I am obliged to be somewhat persistent in this matter and to again bring before the House the point to which I referred on the last occasion&#x2014;the point with regard to the importance of county police authorities being given time to make their arrangements on the same sort of ground as county borough police authorities. I happened the day after the House last discussed this matter to pick up the most recent issue of the official Blue-book published by the Home Office with regard to the police forces of counties and boroughs, and I find that while there are altogether forty-five counties which have their own police forces, there are about fifty-eight county boroughs; but if you eliminate from those the less important ones with very small police forces, those which would not require much time to prepare for the arrangements that would have to be made under this Bill, you eliminate a fat larger number of small forces from the county boroughs than would be the case in regard to the counties. There are twenty-two county boroughs which have police forces of under 100, and twenty-one have a strength between 100 and 200. Therefore taking 200 as a limit, there are forty-three out of the fifty-eight county boroughs which would not necessarily require the time allowed them for making their preparations.</p>
<col>1082</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02549">On the other hand, in the counties there are only seven police forces under 100 and twelve between 100 to 200. This gives only nineteen in the case of the counties compared with forty-three in the case of the county boroughs. It is quite true that when you come to the larger numbers there are, perhaps, more large police forces in the county boroughs than there are in the counties, but the two largest forces of all are both county forces, and behind them come two of the forces of the very big boroughs. Therefore, if considered fairly all-round the case of its being necessary to give time for arrangements in counties is quite as strong as in county boroughs; and I think it will be found that in the case of scattered police forces, some parts of the county populous and some parts sparsely populated, it will be very difficult to arrange by the addition of members of the force to give what would be absolutely necessary under the Bill&#x2014;one day's rest in seven. In those circumstances I have ventured again to bring this particular point before the House, and my Amendments propose to put the counties in the same position as county boroughs with regard to allowing them to have four years' notice in which to make their arrangements. If my Amendments were inserted, this part of the Bill would run as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"If this Act has not come into force as respects any other police authorities on the expiration of four years from the passing of this Act, it shall come into force at the expiration of such period as may thereafter be fixed by Order in Council."</quote>
Perhaps the most logical thing to do would be to pick out the police forces above a certain number, and say that all those should have a definite time given them for making their preparations, but as that is not the proposal in the Bill, and as the Bill includes all the minor county boroughs with small police forces as well as the large ones, it seems only fair that the counties should be treated in the same way. I beg to move the first Amendment standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02550">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>Clause 1, page 1, line 22, leave out ("operation") and insert ("force"), and leave out ("before")and insert ("on") &#x2014;(<i>Lord Belper.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02551"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has taken the convenient course of discussing all his Amendments upon the first one on the Paper, and I
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0567"/>
<col>1083</col>
hope I may have the permission of the House to deal with them in the same way, because I think that taking a single Amendment and discussing it by itself is often found most inconvenient. With regard to the first Amendment on the Paper&#x2014;that is, in line 22, to leave out the word "operation" and to substitute the word "force," and to leave out the word "before" and to insert the word "on" &#x2014;so far as the Home Office are concerned we shall be very glad to accept it. But with regard to the other Amendments, I am anxious, if I can, to persuade the noble Lord to accept an alternative Amendment, which will, I hope, commend itself to him.<lb/>
Before referring to that further I feel that I owe it to your Lordships to explain a mistake which I made on the Committee stage of the Bill with regard to county boroughs. I am afraid I misled the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the point of the Orders in Council affecting county boroughs. I find, on looking into the point, that that is not so, and that, as the Bill stands at present, the county boroughs, in which the noble Lord opposite, Lord Wenlock, is interested, would not be affected. I have thought it right to make this explanation to the House.<lb/>
With regard to the noble Lord's further Amendments, with the technical wording of which I will not trouble your Lordships at the present time, I think you will see that the effect of them would be that the Act would come into force at a date fixed by an Order in Council, but that the Order in Council could not be made for four years, during which time the authorities would have an opportunity of obtaining recruits and increasing their police forces. The alternative which I wish to suggest is again one with the actual technical wording of which I will not trouble your Lordships at this moment; but the effect of the Amendment which I would ask your Lordships to consider as an alternative is this&#x2014;that the Act should come into force at a date fixed by Order in Council, but that the date should not be earlier than four years from the passing of the Act. That, I think, really meets the point, but it would not cause the delay which might arise through the adoption of the Amendments which have been placed on the Paper by the noble Lord
<col>1084</col>
below the Gangway. Supposing the Order in Council could not be issued within four years, and we then thought it necessary to give these large local authorities ample time in which to secure recruits, the benefits of the Act would not really accrue to all the police constables in the country for eight years. What we should like to do would be to give them the benefit of it at the expiration of four years. If the noble Lord would allow us to put it in such a way that the Order in Council might, if thought desirable, be issued at once, giving a period of four years, the noble Lord would be able to raise a discussion in this House upon it, and, if necessary, secure an alteration in the draft Order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02552"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the promoters of the Bill are most anxious to meet the noble Lord and the County Councils Association in every way, and I think he can congratulate himself on the excessive inroads he has already made into the material of this Bill. May I say, on behalf of the promoters, that we willingly recognise the desire to give a reasonable time for bringing this Bill into operation, but I do venture to hope that the alternative suggested by the Home Office may commend itself to the noble Lord. It seems to me that that is quite a sufficient time to allow for the bringing of this Bill into operation, and the fact that each Order in Council may be made the matter of debate and comment in this House ought to be a sufficient safeguard for the interests of the people concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02553"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards the county boroughs I am bound to say that I have heard with great regret the withdrawal by the noble Earl of the statement he made in Committee that county boroughs were to be placed on the same footing as counties. I accepted the noble Earl's statement on that occasion, and was greatly disappointed to hear that the wording of the clause would not cover that particular point. I am bound to say I have heard the noble Earl's statement with the greatest regret and the keenest disappointment. I had hoped that I had impressed upon him the importance of placing county boroughs on the same footing as counties, and I much regret that the noble Earl misled me on the last occasion, as otherwise I might have taken steps to raise the question again on Report. In these circumstances I am afraid nothing
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0568"/>
<col>1085</col>
further can be done, and we must accept the situation as we now find it.<lb/>
At the same time, perhaps, I might be allowed to ask the noble Earl what the position will be with regard to the counties. I understand that notice will be given by Order in Council that the Bill is to come into force on a particular date. It may be three or four years before the Order will take effect. That Order can be objected to when it first appears, say, four years before it is to come into force. But the circumstances of counties may be very different four years hence from what they are to-day, and arguments brought forward to oppose the Order in Council may not have the force to-day which they would have four years hence. The position of the counties is altering every day. New areas are being taken from counties, and the position may be very different four years hence from what it is to-day. I do not know whether the Home Office have considered that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02554"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not surprised that a note of disappointment should have run through the observations just delivered by my noble friend behind me, because, like him, I was left under the impression when we last discussed this subject that this procedure by Order in Council was to apply to all police authorities whether in counties or in boroughs. But the noble Earl who represents the Home Office has told us very candidly on that point that he was not precisely aware of the operation of the measure. Whatever may be the merits, I venture to suggest to my noble friend that it would be impossible for us now to alter the Bill so as to extend procedure by Order in Council to the county boroughs. There is no Amendment on the Paper to that effect, and the alteration would be a vital one. It would, moreover, be an alteration which I gather the promoters of the Bill and the Home Office do not regard with favour. In those circumstances I venture to think we shall do well to accept the variant of Lord Belper's Amendment which is proposed by the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite, which will, I understand, have this effect, that procedure by Order in Council will apply to the county boroughs, but the Order in Council may be made and also discussed at any time during the period of the interregnum of four years, although
<col>1086</col>
it will not come into operation until after the period of four years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02555"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I have misled the noble Marquess. The Order in Council procedure will not apply to county boroughs. It will apply to county councils and other authorities, but not to county boroughs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02556"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The procedure of Order in Council will not apply at all to county boroughs?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02557"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: That is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02558"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It will apply only to county and other police authorities. Then the difference between my noble friend and the noble Earl is that my noble friend desired that procedure by Order in Council should, so to speak, not be set in motion until after the four years were over, whereas under the proposal of the noble Earl opposite an Order in Council might be made in the second or third year although it would not take effect until after the four years interregnum had passed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02559"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: As regards this four years, there seems to be a little misapprehension. The period of four years was inserted in the Bill in order to meet the reasonable objections of those who said that it was not possible to organise the police force to secure a weekly rest-day at once owing to the difficulty of obtaining recruits. It is proposed to say now that the Bill shall come into force, but as it is impossible to get sufficient recruits in one year a period of four years is given in which they can be obtained. I understand that an Order in Council would come into force after the interval of four years, during which the authorities would have time to recruit their police forces up to whatever strength is requisite to give full effect to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02560"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: Supposing in my county an Order in Council comes out two years hence, would that Order in Council give us four years from the date of its appearance, or would the Order provide for the coming into effect of this weekly rest-day four years after the passing of this Bill, thereby only giving us two years in which to make the necessary
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0569"/>
<col>1087</col>
arrangements? On that point I am not clear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02561"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I have not yet seen on the Paper the actual Amendment which the Home Office propose to substitute for those drafted by Lord Belper. I do not know whether it would be possible for the noble Earl who represents the Home Office to read out the exact words of the Amendment which he proposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02562"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I shall be very glad to do so. The alternative Amendment which I suggest would be this, that the clause should read&#x2014;
<quote>"And if this Act has not come into force as respects any other police authority&#x2014;</quote>
that is to say, a county authority or a smaller borough&#x2014;
<quote>"on such date, not less than four years after the passing of this Act, as may hereafter he fixed by Order in Council, it shall come into force at any date so fixed."</quote>
I think these things are very complicated and difficult to follow, but if we might see the Amendment in print in the Bill we might have an opportunity on Third Reading of considering whether a further Amendment was necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02563"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that I have been reasonably met in the different Amendments which I have proposed. I shall be very glad to accept the Amendment suggested by the noble Earl on behalf of the Home Office if it does carry out what I hope it may do, and ensure that we shall not have shorter notice than four years. I recognise that we have one weapon which may be of some advantage&#x2014;namely, the provision that these Orders in Council have to lie on the Table of the House. I do not fancy that any Minister representing the Home Office is likely to be unreasonable when we have such a weapon as that, which will enable us to object to the Order in Council when made if reasonable proofs are not given that it is a proper action to take. If I may leave it in that form until I see it on Third Reading, I shall be glad.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02574"><member>LORD BELPER</member>, on behalf of Viscount ST. ALDWYN, next moved an Amendment to provide that the Order in Council "may contain such modifications as may be necessary to provide for the case of small police stations in rural districts, or for other special circumstances affecting the district of a police authority."</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02575">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I must ask your indulgence in moving the next Amendment. The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, is unavoidably prevented from being here to-day, and has requested me to state the reasons which have induced him to ask for this little further Amendment in the Bill. The fact is, there are many rural counties where the difficulties may be considerable in carrying this Bill into force absolutely literally. In Gloucestershire there are more than fifty stations with only one policeman, and there are more than forty with only two policemen. I believe this is true to almost the same extent in Wiltshire, and I have no doubt that if we had the opportunity of getting the statistics of other counties we should find that there are others similarly situated. It is quite true that in such districts there is practically no crime, and the policeman's work on the Sunday usually consists in attending church and having a healthy walk in the afternoon. But this is often the day when boys get into mischief, and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0570"/>
<col>1089</col>
it is very undesirable that a district should be left without police on Sundays. If one constable had to relieve another, it would often involve very great trouble, and expense, and it seems, therefore, that some variation should be made to allow of the particular difficulties of rural districts like these being met in some way as by a modification of the Order in Council. I am sure noble Lords will see that the suggestion which Lord St. Aldwyn has made is of a very reasonable character, and designed to meet practical difficulties which would no doubt arise if you had to carry out absolutely literally the relieving of every policeman for one day in seven and putting another in his place. I am sorry the noble Viscount is not here, as he probably has more knowledge than I have of the particular districts to which his Amendment refers; but I think your Lordships will recognise the importance of having some latitude with regard to these cases.</p>

<title>LAWLESSNESS IN IRELAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02591"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> rose to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the continuance of acts of lawlessness in various districts in Ireland; and to ask what steps the Government propose to take for the better prevention of crime, the conviction and punishment of offenders, and the protection of the lives and property of peaceful subjects in those districts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02592">The noble Marquess said: My Lords, I offer no apology for asking the Question that stands in my name, and drawing the attention of His Majesty's Government to the lawless condition of certain parts of Ireland. Indeed, I regret that as those outrages have occurred, as this lawlessness has increased, this condition of affairs has not been more frequently brought before your Lordships' notice by members on the Back Benches. The Irish Unionist Members in another place have done their utmost to draw the attention of this country to what is going on in the districts to which I allude. They have asked a number of Questions of the Chief Secretary, and the vast majority of their statements they have proved up to the hilt. But the rules of the House of Commons preclude Members elaborating their Questions, and the time of the House is so occupied that it is impossible for Irish Unionist Members to raise a discussion on this very serious state of affairs. In those circumstances, time having been refused only last week in another place to discuss this state of affairs, I at once put down the Question that stands in my name, and, as I said in my opening remarks, I offer no apology to your Lordships for trespassing upon your time in asking it.</p>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0572"/>
<col>1093</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02593">I do not hesitate to say that I would far rather have seen this subject raised in another place, where the Minister responsible for the Government of Ireland is face to face with the Irish Unionist. Members. I have another reason for saying this, because although I have on various occasions raised what is called the Irish question in your Lordships' House, I have never succeeded in obtaining a complete or full answer to many of my queries from those noble Lords on the Front Bench who represent the Irish Government. To-day, however, I may be more fortunate. Let me say at once that in the Notice I have put on the Paper to-day I confine my criticisms entirely to certain localities. No one realises more than I do, and no one who cares two straws for Ireland could do other than rejoice at the fact, that the greater part of Ireland can be at the present moment acknowledged to be in a satisfactory condition. It is only the four counties to which I allude which can be considered at the present moment the black spots of Ireland. It is a pleasurable task on behalf of those living in the districts that are of a satisfactory character, to acknowledge that this is the case, but I do not know that that is any consolation to those unfortunate people living in the four counties to which I am going to allude, who are told, "Oh, you must not mind in the least what misery you are undergoing, as the whole of the rest of Ireland is in a satisfactory condition."</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02594">What I want to ask is, Why should not Ireland be in a very satisfactory condition? I was in that country a short time ago, and I can assure your Lordships from my own knowledge, having travelled through the country from north to south, that the prospects of prosperity in Ireland are of a most satisfactory character. The crops are most healthy and most abundant, the prices of cattle are very high, the outlook of the agriculturist is most favourable, and one of the best barometers of Irish prosperity is the fact that the investments in the Post Office Savings Banks have steadily increased during the last few years, and that during the last half-year they have increased by upwards of &#x00A3;600,000. Therefore, my Lords, I ask, Why should not Ireland be in a satisfactory condition? There is, of course, one great advantage. The Act of my right hon. friend Mr. Wyndham&#x2014;the Act of 1902&#x2014;has worked with the most admirable results. The only check
<col>1094</col>
to it has been the Act of the Government of last year, which certainly has retarded sale and purchase. Why it was introduced I leave His Majesty's Government to explain to the Irish people, but, at any rate, it has not facilitated the transfer of land. On the contrary, it has hindered and impeded an Act which was working with the greatest possible success.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02595">I now turn to the four counties to which indirectly I refer in the Question I have upon the Paper&#x2014;the counties of Clare, Galway, Longford, and Roscommon. I ask His Majesty's Government to tell me why those counties should be the black spots in what should be a prosperous country. In all probability they will not give the answer which I should give to that inquiry. I say that the reason those counties are the four black spots is that the law of the land is ignored there. The law of the League is all-powerful; and by the Government virtually abrogating the law of the land and allowing the law of the League to be paramount, they are not only permitting but encouraging this state of lawlessness. I do not think that any one on the Benches opposite will deny for a moment that these four counties are in a very unsatisfactory condition, and for this reason, that they remain at the present time subject to proclamation, and so disturbed are they that the presence of additional police is absolutely essential. I notice that the county of Leitrim is not amongst those proclaimed counties. I have no doubt the Government have good reasons for leaving it out, but I do not quite understand why Leitrim is not included in the proclaimed counties when it is the fact that in the county of Leitrim no fewer than sixty-five persons are wholly boycotted. Perhaps the noble Earl the Lord President, who I understand is going to reply to me to-day, will be able to give me an answer. I do not think a county in which sixty-five persons are wholly boycotted can be declared to be in a satisfactory condition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02596">But the counties to which I chiefly propose to allude are the counties of Galway and Clare. It is now eighteen months since I drew the attention of your Lordships' House to the condition of certain parts of Ireland, and when I last did so I alluded specially to the counties of Clare and Galway. I remember on that occasion that the noble Lord who then replied for
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0573"/>
<col>1095</col>
the Irish Office, Lord Denman, admitted that the counties of Clare and Galway were in a very bad condition. Well, so they are now; and I think that the fact that the same condition of affairs exists at the present time as was admitted eighteen months ago proves beyond all doubt that the policy of the Government in the administration of Ireland has failed so far as those two counties are concerned. I propose, in elaborating this question, to draw your Lordships' attention to the various classes of lawlessness which exist at the present moment in those counties and in certain other parts of Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02597">I allude, in the first place, to cattle-driving. We have had the question of cattle-driving raised in another place and in this House, but His Majesty's Government, as far as I can remember, never really took a serious view of what I think in this country would be described as an illegal action, and which would be punished in the Courts of law if it were attempted. I remember quite well that when Mr. Birrell's Land Bill, to which I have alluded, was introduced, we were told that it would put a stop to cattle-driving. Indeed, in Ireland I believe it was described as the "Cattle-drivers' Charter." That Act has now been in force six months, but no stop whatever has been put to cattle-driving. That Act, which we were told would put a stop to it, has not checked cattle-driving. The only thing which it has checked is the successful transfer of land to the occupying tenants, which was going on most admirably until that Bill was introduced. Cattle-driving at the present moment is flourishing from the cattle-drivers' point of view. There have been 101 drives this year to the end of May; and between April 1 and June 8 there were 61 drives, compared with 66 over the same period last year. Therefore, I do not think that the Government can claim that their Land Act has done any good in the way of preventing cattle-driving. I should like to have from the Government an explanation of the falsifying of their prophecies with regard to what that Act was going to do; for at the present moment we not only see cattle-driving as it existed in the past, but we see it now in its very worst form.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02598">I know that in the early days of cattle-driving His Majesty's Government looked upon it, I think one member of the Government
<col>1096</col>
said rather as a joke, and another said as a harmless amusement. At any rate, they never condemned it; they tolerated it, and now the system of cattle-driving has gone further, and I should like to know whether they will so describe it now when Quarter Sessions on many occasions are giving compensation in respect of cattle that have been injured in the course of these drives. Cruelty, in addition to cattle-driving, has been introduced, and I ask His Majesty's Government, that being the case, why they do not prosecute these people for cruelty even if they tolerate what is known as ordinary cattle-driving. I fully believe that His Majesty's Government are composed of humane gentlemen, and when I tell them that compensation has been given, not only for the beating and laming of cattle in driving them over fences, but for deliberate maiming, cutting off tails, and killing animals by shooting at them, I do not think they will contend that this class of cattle-driving ought to be ignored by a responsible Government. Intimidation is being used in a severer form in order to coerce law-abiding people into obeying the wishes and commands of the United Irish League. What have the Government done to check cattle-driving?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02599">And why does cattle-driving at the present moment flourish from the cattle-drivers' point of view more than it has ever done in the past? It is because the cattle-drivers, whether they injure cattle or not, have no fear whatever of punishment. They know full well that for them there is only one law, the law of the United Irish League; and they know full well, if they carry out the edicts of the United Irish League by systematic cattle-driving, that when the millennium which they hope will come arrives, they will receive a large share in the breaking up of the lands. Is it to be wondered at that the law as administered by His Majesty's Government is ignored when these cattle-drivers realise what are the consequences if they are prosecuted by the Irish Executive? Suppose a cattle-driver is prosecuted, what happens to him? If he is found guilty he is bound over to keep the peace; that is all; and if he refuses to do so he goes voluntarily to prison. But is he when in gaol treated with severe punishment? Nothing of the sort. His time is made as easy as possible for him while he is in prison, and there is no severity whatever exercised upon him.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0574"/>
<col>1097</col>
Consequently the cattle-driver has everything to gain by breaking the law in obedience to the United Irish League, and nothing whatever to fear at the hands of the law as administered by His Majesty's Government. That he should have to go to prison with hard labour as the result of his lawlessness is practically a nonexistent risk.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02600">Now let me give the statistics as to the number of proceedings taken. Of all the 1,300 odd cases, in less than one-sixth have any proceedings been instituted at all. Only eleven cases have been brought before juries, and in only two cases have convictions followed. This year in not a single case have a jury convicted. As long as the Government allow men to obtain a certificate of nationality at so cheap a rate, so long will cattle-driving flourish. After those statistics surely the Irish Executive must recognise that their efforts to put down cattle-driving have entirely failed, and surely it is time that they either reversed their policy and gave full notice that if the law is broken in the future as it has been in the past the Government will see that the full penalty is meted out to the law-breakers, or else tell us at once that they entirely ignore the law and wish every law breaker to carry on his nefarious trade with immunity so far as they are concerned. The failure of insisting on respect for the law in Ireland has gone now beyond cattle-driving. The United Irish League and the law-breakers do not hesitate, if cattle-driving does not meet their ends, to resort to severer means in order to coerce law-abiding and peaceable inhabitants in these parts of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02601">The returns show that there is a considerable increase in the number of people who are under police protection and who are boycotted since the time that His Majesty's Government have been responsible for the government of Ireland. I note that the Government, when they have been attacked on this point, have stated that this lawlessness so far as boycotting is concerned is beyond their control. They have said that nothing can practically cure these spasmodic outbursts of lawlessness, but that given time the state of things will return to the normal. I have never believed that argument, and I have always contradicted it when I have had the chance. During the last three years the increased number of people under
<col>1098</col>
police protection and who are boycotted endorses my opinion that the Government could, if they would, put down this very unsatisfactory state of affairs. But if it is to be put down&#x2014;and I do not suppose for one moment they will allow that this state of affairs is satisfactory&#x2014;it must be recognised that a weak Executive encourages law-breakers, and that lawlessness will continue so long as the Government allow it to be imagined that they are unable to check these cases of lawlessness. The Government undoubtedly have powers. They have the powers which we possessed not when I first went to Ireland in 1886, but which we obtained towards the end of 1887. With these powers we coped with a serious condition of affairs, and when the Government of which I was then a member left Ireland in 1892 there was not a single person boycotted in that country. Why cannot His Majesty's Government take advantage of these powers and endeavour to put down boycotting with the same strong hand? So long as they continue not to check lawlessness, so long will this unsatisfactory state of things continue in the districts to which I have alluded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02602">There is another form of lawlessness to which I wish to allude, and for which, I think, the Government, and the Government alone, are responsible. I refer to the large number of firearms possessed at the present moment by the inhabitants in these parts of Ireland, due entirely to the action of His Majesty's Government in refusing to renew the Peace Preservation Act in 1906. Any one who studies the Irish newspapers must have been shocked at the shooting outrages that have taken place during the last few months. What I want to ask is this&#x2014;and I hope I shall get an answer to this question&#x2014;What reasons induced His Majesty's Government to allow the Peace Preservation Act to lapse in 1906? I remember that in this House we asked for the reasons, but we got none. I hope I shall get an answer to-night. Did the Government ask the opinion of their officials in support of their action? If they did, did the officials support them in allowing the Peace Preservation Act to lapse? That is a very important point because it is the officials and inspectors in Ireland who really would have known what was going to be the result of this, and if the officials advised the Government to allow this Act to lapse, then I say these
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0575"/>
<col>1099</col>
officials are very much to blame. If, on the other hand, the Government ignored the opinion of the officials, then I say the Government were taking upon themselves a responsibility which no Government had a right to assume. What has been the result of the lapsing of the Peace Preservation Act? There has been in certain parts of Ireland what I may call a free trade in firearms. They have been used with appalling frequency and on the smallest provocation. An Irishman when he gets a revolver looks upon it very much as he would upon a blackthorn, and he uses it in a reckless manner. Knowing this fact I wish to have an answer to my question as to the reason why this Act was allowed to lapse.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02603">Those of your Lordships who have studied the Irish newspapers, and even the London newspapers, will have noticed a series of shooting outrages at Newmarket in Cork, and at Roundfort, in the county of Mayo. Perhaps a description from a Nationalist newspaper of the scene at Roundfort on March 20 may bring home to His Majesty's Government the effect of their policy. The occasion was a conflict of rival Nationalist factions, and the <i>Mayo News</i> thus describes the scene&#x2014;
<quote>"Hand-to-hand encounters continued, sticks being freely used and the fighting arena changed from the fields to the roadway. Stones now commenced to fly through the air, while a further element of danger to life and limb was added by the frightened horses galloping along the road. One of the Claremorris brakes was left some distance behind in the direction of Roundfort, and as many of Mr. O'Kelly's opponents had by this time got on the roadway in front, the driver (Thomas Keane), was subjected to a fusilade of sticks and stones as he drove along at a gallop towards Hollymount. It was a brutal spectacle to witness, as stones, weighing a pound and more, were hurled mercilessly at the unfortunate man as he sat in the exposed position on the driver's seat. The reins got broken and the horses dashed madly along uncontrolled, while both the driver and the animals attached to the brake were repeatedly struck. It is a matter for marvel how the man escaped more serious injury. As it was, he sustained some ugly cuts about the head, while his ribs are also injured. This incident alone will serve to give an idea of the ferocity exhibited, and it is a matter for congratulation that we have not to record loss of life. After the brake had passed, the scrimmages continued along the road, and the shouting and general din created by the combatants was further accentuated by the discharge of revolvers. Several shots were discharged from one of the Claremorris cars, but the bullets luckily found no billets. By this time the police were getting the crowds again in check, but not before some of the police themselves had sustained some injuries from stones."</quote>
I have quoted that to show the danger of
<col>1100</col>
allowing the Peace Preservation Act to lapse and these irresponsible people to secure firearms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02604">There is another point. The shooting outrages since 1906 have steadily increased. In the year 1906 there were sixty, and in the three and a-half years since the lapsing of the Act there have been no fewer than 520. I am not going to weary your Lordships by quoting the answer given by the Chief Secretary in another place, but he virtually admitted that shooting outrages had steadily increased. He also said that he was carefully considering what the alteration in the law must be, and I think he said&#x2014;I speak subject to correction&#x2014;that an alteration would be made with regard to the carrying of firearms both in England and in Ireland. I say nothing with regard to England, but certainly with regard to the right of carrying firearms in Ireland there can be no question that there ought to be an alteration in the law and that the Peace Preservation Act ought to be revived. Are the perpetrators of the various outrages to which I have drawn attention&#x2014;cattle-driving, boycotting, shooting&#x2014;brought to justice and properly punished? From a reply given in the House of Commons some indication of the failure of the law to punish offenders is shown. It refers to last year and to certain classes of agrarian crime only.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02605">Out of fourteen cases of firing at the person, in only two cases were the offenders brought to justice. Of thirty-eight cases of firing into dwellings every single offender escaped. Twenty-one cases of killing or maiming cattle were recorded; in twenty cases no one was arrested. In only one case out of fifty-one crimes recorded as injury to property was any one brought to justice. In 175 cases out of 178 cases of intimidation by threatening letters and notices, no one was made amenable. The same result is recorded in twenty-four out of thirty-two cases of other kinds of intimidation. Altogether, in only fifteen out of 334 crimes were offenders brought to justice. What does that prove? It proves that the law as administered at the present moment is absolutely powerless to cope with crime. We are told that the reason these malefactors are not brought to justice is that it is impossible to get evidence against them. I have heard that argument put forward both in your Lordships' House and in another place, but I have
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0576"/>
<col>1101</col>
always declined to accept it. I consider that the Government are responsible for the peace and safety of the people, and that with the powers they have, if they choose to exercise them, they can get the necessary evidence. But the reason they cannot get evidence at the present moment is that there is no confidence in the administration of justice, and no belief that the law will be fearlessly and honestly administered. So long as terror prevails, so long as the Government virtually permit this terror to prevail, witnesses will not come forward.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02606">Now what are the steps that the Government should take? They should take the steps that we took in the year 1887, when we had the same difficulties to cope with. We took advantage of the provisions of the Crimes Act&#x2014;I always object to that name myself, and I prefer to call it the Repression of Crimes Act&#x2014;and by that means we obtained the necessary evidence. We were able to obtain evidence from people when no one was accused. We had the power of summoning these people, and we got evidence without any great difficulty, and by means of that evidence we were able to bring the law-breakers to justice. But at the present moment His Majesty's Government seem to decline to make use of any of these powers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02607"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Might I interrupt the noble Marquess? I think there were at the time he was in Ireland 100 or more cases in some years of firing at the person or into dwellings. Can he supplement his statistics by saying in how many cases convictions were secured?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02608"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: The Crimes Act was not passed until the end of 1887. I admit that the state of Ireland from 1886, when I went there, was one of lawlessness unparalleled in any country, but the instant we got the Crimes Act passed&#x2014;in August, 1887&#x2014;we lost no time in putting it into force. We took every advantage of it by changing the venue and in other ways to secure the punishment of offenders, and the noble Earl, I think, will allow that when he took over the government of Ireland there was not a single person boycotted in that country. The noble Earl was quite justified in interrupting me, but I think he was alluding to the early part when we entered into office and before we secured the
<col>1102</col>
Crimes Act. There were then murders in all directions and a great amount of intimidation; but before we left Ireland we had completely altered that. I think the noble Earl will find that after we had secured the Crimes Act all these classes of crime entirely stopped, of course by degrees. This power of examining without anybody being accused is now the law of the land in Scotland, and I cannot understand why His Majesty's Government will not take advantage of these powers, as we did, and put a stop to the state of affairs now going on in Ireland. I venture to say they could get the necessary evidence if they took the steps which we took in the years 1887, 1888, and 1889.<lb/>
But I expect I shall hear from noble Lords who will follow me that His Majesty's Government object to adopt what they call coercion. I take exception to the use of the word "coercion." I object still more to the coercion of the unfortunate people in these districts who are boycotted and shot at, and whose lives are made a burden to them. That is a coercion which the Government ought to use coercion against. I do not know whether your Lordships realise what it means to be boycotted and the miserable life of a boycotted man in these lawless districts. He cannot get the necessaries of life, he cannot get a servant to work for him, he cannot get tradesmen to sell him provisions for his home, he cannot even get his horses shod, and his children, if they go to school, are ostracised by the other children. Is it right, is it just, that we, a law abiding people, with a Government responsible for the happiness, welfare, and prosperity of every subject, whether he be high or low, should allow this state of things to go on and be absolutely callous with regard to it? I often wonder whether the Chief Secretary really knows what is going on. His visits to Ireland are very few and very brief when he goes there, but I cannot believe that a man who is humane, if he really understood what these unfortunate people are going through, could tolerate this state of affairs.<lb/>
May I, in conclusion, give a personal thought of my own? I live in the northeast of Ireland, which is peaceful and law-abiding, and only a fortnight ago, on a beautiful night in June, I was wandering at dusk in the grounds of my own demesne, and I could not help thinking that if I
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0577"/>
<col>1103</col>
was in the position of one of these poor people in these unfortunate districts I should have to be accompanied by a couple of policemen with rifles. Do you not think that we in the north of Ireland, who enjoy this happiness and prosperity, feel for our fellow-countrymen in the disturbed parts? It is because we feel for them, and because we have that sympathy which I hope is inherent in every true Irishman, that we call attention on every possible occasion to the state of things which now exists in these parts of Ireland. If we did not work on behalf of these people we should be unworthy of being considered Irishmen and unworthy of being considered Ulstermen; and it is on those grounds that I ask the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02609"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BBAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess who has just sat down has raised once more the question of lawlessness in Ireland, but I am not quite sure to what period he exactly refers, whether he means that the lawlessness has been getting worse during the last few months or whether it has been continuous from the time that His Majesty's Government first took office. But in the midst of his descriptions of the unfortunate occurrences which have taken place, it was gratifying to us to know that the prospects of prosperity in Ireland are so satisfactory at the present time, and I am sure we must all join in satisfaction at hearing the striking and remarkable figures of the increase in the deposits of the Post Office Savings Banks during the last few months in Ireland. One cannot help, in these circumstances, asking oneself whether it is not possible that the noble Marquess has looked at the lawlessness with the eye of exaggeration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02610"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I confined my remarks entirely to the disturbed counties, and congratulated His Majesty's Government on the satisfactory condition of the other parts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02611"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am delighted that the noble Marquess should have so confined himself because on previous occasions when we have had debates on this subject noble Lords opposite have said that we must not isolate different parts of Ireland and deal with one or two counties by themselves, but that we were discussing
<col>1104</col>
the state of Ireland as a whole. It is some step forward that the noble Marquess should this evening allow us to treat the counties where there is more disturbance by themselves, and that he is willing to admit that in far the larger part of Ireland there is perfect peace and great prosperity.<lb/>
Now let us turn to the exact figures with regard to the outrages that have taken place. There is no doubt, I think, from the figures that there was a marked improvement in 1909 as compared with 1908, and that, on the whole, that improvement has been maintained during the first six months of this year. The total number of agrarian outrages in 1908 was 343; in 1909, 219; and from January to June, 1910, 119. Then agrarian and non-agrarian outrages in 1908 were 2,284; 1909, 2,180; and in the last six months, 1,022. That shows, I think, that the present state of Ireland can hardly be described as at any rate increasing in lawlessness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02612"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Those are the figures for the whole country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02613"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Yes, the figures for the whole country of all outrages, agrarian and non-agrarian. With regard to cattle-driving, I confess it was with special regret that I heard the noble Marquess accuse His Majesty's Government of not having done any good in the direction of stopping cattle-driving. I hope the figures will relieve his mind on that point. The total number of cattle-drives in 1908 was 681; in 1909 the number fell to 200; in the first five months of this year there were only 107; and in the month of June there were only nine. I hope the noble Marquess in these circumstances will realise that a very decided and remarkable improvement has really and truly taken place with regard to cattle-driving in Ireland. And may I ask him whether he has sufficiently considered the encouragement which is given by speeches such as he has made to-night to the lawbreakers and cattle-drivers in Ireland? The noble Marquess has told us that His Majesty's Government do not punish adequately the guilty persons. He has said, with all the weight of his authority as a past Lord-Lieutenant and a large landowner in Ireland, that His Majesty's Government do not think it necessary to take steps to punish this crime. Nothing could be more likely to encourage or assist lawbreaking.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0578"/>
<col>1105</col>
to go on than language such as that when held by one in the position of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02614"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: How have the Government punished it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02615"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether the noble Marquess prefers punishing to stopping crime. The steps which His Majesty's Government have taken have succeeded in stopping cattle-driving, and that, surely, is the object at which we should all aim. I hope that is not too advanced a statement to make with regard to the theory of punishment in these days. The great thing is to stop the crime rather than to secure punishment, which very often only hardens the criminal and leads him to repeat the offence. The chief point is that we have managed to reduce cattle-driving to this remarkable extent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02616"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: What about the cruelty to the cattle&#x2014;cutting off their tails and maiming them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02617"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Marquess will allow me I will come to that later. The total number of persons under police protection on December 31,1908,was 344;on December 31,1909,342; and now, 331. His Majesty's Government are prepared to say that, while there has been this general improvement in the country, the state of certain portions, though better than it was, is still far from satisfactory. The noble Marquess wishes me to deal at once with the question of cattle maiming.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02618"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: No, but I was afraid you were leaving it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02619"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am quite willing to take it now. I cannot help feeling that on this matter, again, the noble Marquess is rather apt to pay undue attention to what happens in Ireland, without sufficiently considering that there are crimes of just as bad, if not worse, a character occurring in England to which he does not think it necessary to call the attention of this House. Take the case of cattle maiming alone. In 1908 there were 22 cases in the whole of Ireland, and during the same year there was an epidemic of cattle maiming in England. At Chatham several horses were ill-treated, at Grimsby
<col>1106</col>
there commenced a series of outrages which went on from February to September, in Norfolk there were, in March, further cases of maiming cattle. At Liverpool a farmer had a number of lambs mutilated, in May cattle outrages took place near Peterborough, and in Staffordshire there were also cases of maiming. It is with deep regret that one realises that there are people who do indulge in this particular crime, but if this crime exists in Ireland it exists also in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02620"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I should like to know whether in the English cases the perpetrators were found and brought to justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02621"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess will remember the remarkable case of Edalje, which created a good deal of excitement at the time. It is not very easy to find the perpetrators. These occurrences very often happen at night.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02625"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I think it was one of those very complicated cases in which the police were not at all sure that the evidence at their command was satisfactory. These cases, as I have said, happen at night when it is not easy to find, out who is the culprit; and the series of outrages in Staffordshire went on for a number of months without anybody being caught or convicted for the offence. Then with regard to malicious burnings there were a number of cases near Dunstable. But it was not thought necessary to apply any special measure to these particular districts, either with regard to maiming; of cattle or malicious burnings. His Majesty's Government see no reason for applying the special measures for which the noble Marquess asks.<lb/>
I might, perhaps, deal with two of the counties to which the noble Marquess made special reference. Of the total of 219 agrarian outrages which were committed during 1909, 110 were committed
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0579"/>
<col>1107</col>
in Galway and Clare; while of the 331 persons now under police protection throughout Ireland, 191 live in those counties. As I think the noble Marquess himself realises, Clare and Galway are both a great deal worse than the other counties in Ireland. There has been more cattle-driving lately in Westmeath than in any other county except Galway, and proceedings are now pending against a Member of Parliament, but as the case is <i>sub judice</i> I am sure the noble Marquess will not wish me to refer to it on this occasion.<lb/>
With regard to the question of firearms, I do not know that there is very much to add to what has already been said in debates in this House. It is a matter which not only concerns Ireland but the whole of the United Kingdom. His Majesty's Government fully accept the responsibility for the step which they took in withdrawing the Peace Preservation Act. The Prime Minister has recently stated in another place, in reply to Captain Craig, that the whole question is under consideration. I should say that this is one of those cases in which His Majesty's Government will certainly refuse to shelter themselves behind the opinion of their officials, and I do not think it is one of those questions which, even when they are put in this House, generally receive an answer. The noble Marquess will himself realise that it is far better and more in accordance with the traditions of our public life that His Majesty's Government should accept full responsibility. Cases of firing at the person or into dwellings decreased in 1909, and although the decline is not maintained this year there is no great increase. The total number of cases in 1908 was 131; in 1909, 84; and in the first six months of 1910 there were 48. The total number of outrages in which firearms were used was 207 in 1908; 127 in 1909&#x2014;a very remarkable decrease; and 69 in the first five months of this year.<lb/>
In regard to these figures I should like to turn to a question put by my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal to the noble Marquess with regard to cases of outrages in which firearms were used during the period the noble Marquess was Lord-Lieutenant. There were 103 cases in 1888. That was, of course, after the time when the noble Marquess had the full resources of the Crimes Act at his disposal. The information which my noble friend Lord Crewe
<col>1108</col>
wished to elicit was, how many prosecutions and convictions took place in those 103 cases. The noble Marquess could not, of course, be expected to carry the figures in his head; but I am sure we should all be glad, on some future occasion, to know whether the noble Marquess was fully able to deal with those eases in the way in which he now expects us to deal with all the cases that occur in Ireland. If we find that, out of these 103 cases which occurred six months after the passing of the Crimes Act, there was a considerable number in which the noble Marquess did not prosecute, or, if he did prosecute, did not secure a conviction, then at any rate His Majesty's Government will be able to lay this satisfaction to their soul, that they have not been more unsuccessful than was the noble Marquess when he was Viceroy of Ireland. The noble Marquess, if I may say so, entered into no argument to prove that if we had adopted the measures he wishes us to take and put the Crimes Act into force we would have succeeded in improving the present state of affairs in Ireland or in diminishing the amount of crime.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be allowed to enter one single <i>caveat</i> with regard to these figures. These figures might be said by some people to point two ways. If there is a great deal of terrorism in the country, then no one dares to offend against the unwritten law, and therefore the necessity for police really diminishes, paradoxical though it may seem, and under that aspect of affairs it might be held that the more police protection necessary the greater was the amelioration of the condition of the country. I do not know whether that will commend itself to noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02627"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I make it merely as a <i>caveat</i>. Lawlessness is, quite obviously, a great deal less than it used to be, and His Majesty's Government wish that noble Lords opposite would join with them in looking a little more upon the improvement which has taken place rather than scanning with a magnifying glass the unhappy occurrences which still take place. The problem is not an isolated one, but must be considered in relation to the history of Ireland, and more particularly in connection with its agrarian and economic history.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1109</col>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02628"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just sat down has presented the case of the Government in a way that I am sure your Lordships will very readily follow. The noble Marquess admitted in the frankest possible way that, taking the whole condition of Ireland at the present time, it is economically prosperous and thriving, and he did not suggest that as to the greater part of Ireland it called for any particular question or censure as to its criminal position. He concentrated attention on the fact, which every one acquainted with Ireland knows, that there are some parts of Ireland where the figures speak in a Way so clearly as to its criminal position as to at once require and demand an explanation as to why it is, when Ireland as a whole is quiet and prosperous, that in those particular four counties, although they share the prosperity, there should exist the present aspects of criminality which call for special attention from the Government.<lb/>
The noble Earl, in his careful review of the position, contrasted the figures, but when he came to present them he thought it wise to quote the figures for the whole of Ireland. In the few remarks which I shall address to your Lordships I shall confine myself to the four counties to which reference was made by the noble Marquess. The question of the Peace Preservation Act is of immense importance. That Act was in existence for years; it was included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, and it contained restrictions upon the carrying of firearms without a licence. The noble Earl has spoken as though the position in Ireland is the same as that in England. That is not the ease, for the use of firearms is restricted in England. If men carry revolvers in their pockets it constantly leads to trouble. That has been pointed out to the Government, and we were told that they would consider the matter. Nothing has been done in the last two sessions. I ask, Is nothing to be done this session?<lb/>
I venture to think that this is a matter of considerable importance bearing in mind the figures that were given in the House of Commons by Mr. Birrell, the Chief Secretary, which show there have been a great number of outrages by firing into houses. I take the case of Clare. There it appears that there were eleven cases of firing into dwelling-houses, and it is worthy of note
<col>1110</col>
that there were only three people made amenable. It is an extremely grave matter that people should have their houses fired into when they and their wives and families are there, and that they should be exposed, it may be to the anguish of great fright, or to the real peril of being hit by deadly missiles. In the counties in question there has been a large increase in these outrages, and that is a matter which is entitled to serious notice. It is no answer to my noble friend behind me to say that there are bad people in England too. I am an Irishman, and I have never dreamt of saying that the Irish were not a most excellent, deserving, kindly, and courteous people. It is my deliberate opinion that they are. As a rule they are a law-abiding people, and they have other attractions that I will not dwell upon now. It is no answer to say that if crimes have been committed in Ireland you could match them in England.<lb/>
You have no crime in England corresponding to the terrible offence of boycotting, which exists in many parishes in Ireland. Boycotting is a form of tyranny which is peculiarly an Irish crime. It is a terrible thing that law-abiding, decent, respectable people, because they violate some unwritten law of the agrarian power, should be shunned and avoided by their fellows, their wives not allowed to do their shopping, and their little children not allowed to go to school without interruption and difficulty, and sometimes, it may be, slight danger. The noble Earl said nothing about boycotting. I do not wonder at it. It is one of the gravest incidents connected with our Irish agrarian life. I wish I could say that it was dying out. I believe it has to a certain extent diminished, but any one who considers the figures that were given a few days ago in the House of Commons by the Chief Secretary will see that there are still a considerable number of people wholly boycotted and many partially boycotted. Police protection is peculiar to Ireland. Where is there any one in England boycotted? Where is there any one in England who cannot go about his ordinary avocation free from police protection? In 1904 there were in Ireland 158 people under police protection. Some of those were under complete police protection, and others under protection by patrol. Compare the number in 1904 with the number now. The noble Earl, I think, said there were
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0581"/>
<col>1111</col>
now 331, but according to the figures given by the Chief Secretary the other day the number of people under police protection, either exclusive or by patrol, had risen in 1910 to 340. That shows a very grave state of affairs. I have not the slightest desire to exaggerate. It is distressing to me as an Irishman to suggest that any part of Ireland is not prosperous and free from crime, but we must not lose sight of the reality of things.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred to cattle-driving. For a considerable time cattle-driving almost died out altogether, but in the last week or ten days there has been a substantial revival of it in several places; and I read in <i>The Times</i> this morning that the Recorder of Galway&#x2014;an able and experienced Judge, of great clearness and moderation of view&#x2014;had said, in dealing with a case in which compensation was claimed for malicious injury caused by cattle-driving, that in some parts of the county of Galway mob law appeared to be triumphant. That is a very grave statement coming from a man who uses the most moderate language. The Judges' charges at the present Assizes are coming in. I have read those that have been delivered, and they do not suggest too rosy a view of matters. I do not wish to be a Cassandra, but they go to show that there is cause for anxiety, and when we have before us all the charges by the able and impartial men who preside at the Assizes we shall be better able to judge as to the state of the country. There is one point in all this from which I derive encouragement. Land purchase, though set back by the Act of last year, is working steadily for peace and the maintenance of law and order in Ireland, and those who have purchased their holdings are in the ranks of law-abiding citizens. I believe that wherever land purchase has prevailed the tenants who have become the new proprietors are a great element for the peace and prosperity of the country.<lb/>
The noble Earl appeared to suggest that it would be reasonable that we should indicate what the Government should do. You must govern as if you meant to be obeyed. Your agents&#x2014;the magistrates and police&#x2014;must feel that they will be supported in all honest efforts to administer the law. That is not saying very much, but it means a great deal. Every one who has held responsible position in Ireland knows that there are no people that so rapidly
<col>1112</col>
understand what is intended and desired by those responsible for their government. Play-acting will not do in Ireland. The Irish have considerable gifts in that direction themselves, and if things are only said to be quoted they know what they are worth. The Irish people rapidly appreciate the sway and rule that governs fairly, reasonably, justly, and with firmness. That is all I feel at liberty to say now; and I have not sought, in the remarks I have made, to exaggerate the case or in the slightest degree to distort the position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02629"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the second debate upon the condition of Ireland to which I have listened during the short time I have had the honour of a seat in your Lordships House. On the previous occasion, about eighteen months ago, I remember listening to a lurid description of the state of Ireland from the noble Marquess who has initiated the debate this evening, and also from the noble and learned Lord who has just spoken. To-night an entirely different story is being told. We have been informed that all Ireland, with the exception of four counties, is in a state of peace and prosperity, and I submit that, comparing now with then, no more conclusive answer to the impeachment brought by the noble Marquess could be made by the Government than the restatement of his own words. Even that restatement would be somewhat exaggerated, because the entire western portion of the great county of Galway is now, as it has been always within my recollection, in a state of profound peace. So that the disturbance to which allusion has been made existed only in part of Galway and in the other three counties to which reference has been made.<lb/>
I think sufficient attention has not been called to a recent new departure in the legal administration of Ireland, which I was very glad to notice in the newspapers. It is this: that instead of requiring sureties for good behaviour from persons accused of cattle-driving, the Crown Officers now propose that they shall be committed to the Assizes on the charge of unlawful assembly. That introduces a new departure in the criminal administration in Ireland, from which I expect great and most beneficial results. But cattle-driving in Ireland, reduced as it is to very small dimensions, is nothing new. It has been always the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0582"/>
<col>1113</col>
expression of an agrarian discontent on the part of the people. You will find it described in the pages of Lecky as rampant 150 years ago, and the only way by which it can be removed is by removing the cause. I quite agree with the noble and learned Lord who has last spoken, that wherever land purchase has extended there you find a complete cessation of all these crimes.<lb/>
I do not desire on this occasion to say anything of an acrimonious nature, but I must be permitted to say that the stoppage of land purchase, such as it is, is due to the action of the landlords of Ireland in this House last year. The noble and learned Lord has found fault with the Act of last year, and I myself, as your Lordships may remember, was not altogether in accordance with all its provisions. But there was one provision in the Act which seemed to me to be singularly in the interest of the landlords of Ireland, and that was the provision which enabled landlords to sell their lands on cash payments. It is quite true that the price of the lands to be bought had to be fixed by a judicial tribunal, but, if landlords were willing to sell and were only anxious to get a fair price, it is only reasonable and proper that if there were a difference with regard to the price it should be settled by a tribunal. It seemed to me a want of wisdom and foresight on the part of Irish landlords to reject that proposal. If that proposal had not been rejected land purchase would now be carried on in Ireland as it was before the Act introducing Stock instead of cash was passed.<lb/>
It was stated that the objection was that the idea of compulsion was united with it. I think that peace and prosperity will not be thoroughly established in Ireland until the whole of the land of the country is bought, and the time will come when it will be necessary to introduce a compulsory measure of purchase to clear up the whole proceeding. If there was a proper tribunal created, I for my part think that the sooner the Irish landlords face that alternative, the better it will be for them and the better it will be for the peace of the country. I cannot agree that there is any stagnation in the administration of the Land Purchase Acts in Ireland at the present time. So far as I can learn&#x2014;and in my detached position I have only the same means of information as is available to the man in the street&#x2014;so
<col>1114</col>
far as I can learn &#x00A3;5,000,000 cash have been allocated during the current year for the purchase of estates of which the agreements had been deposited, and Stock to the extent of &#x00A3;7,000,000 has also been assigned for the same purpose. Therefore in the current year you have funds provided for the final purchase and clearing up of all arrangements connected with &#x00A3;12,000,000 worth of property.<lb/>
It is true, I believe, that in regard to original purchases matters are not so forward, and that not more than &#x00A3;500,000 worth of Stock has been applied for, but it takes some time to get a new arrangement into working order, and at the same time it takes time for tenants on the one side and landlords on the other to see how far their interests are promoted by the new arrangement. But I do think that, instead of raising a barren debate on such a matter as this, it would be more conducive to the interests of the country and more in accordance with the high traditions of your Lordships' House if attention were paid to those defects which may be in the Act of last year, in order that they may be removed and the only panacea for peace and prosperity in Ireland extended throughout the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02630"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had hoped that the able and convincing speech of the noble Marquess who introduced this question and the facts that he brought forward might have produced a more satisfactory reply on the part of His Majesty's Government, but it appears impossible to modify their incurable optimism on the state of things in Ireland. We are told, in reply, that the greater part of Ireland is quiet, and therefore the other parts need not be considered. It is very little satisfaction for those who live, as I do, in the county of Galway to be told that they have no reason to complain because the county Kildare is perfectly quiet. The noble Earl the Lord President compared certain classes of crime in Ireland with corresponding crimes in England. There is one very great difference. These crimes in England are the acts of individuals, isolated acts, and are looked upon with horror and reprobation by the greater part of the people of the country. In Ireland they are the outcome of a widespread and serious conspiracy and agitation, and they are, I may say, winked at by the people in the country. A great many people disapprove of them, but from the system
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0583"/>
<col>1115</col>
of terrorism that exists they are unwilling or unable to come forward and assist in identifying the perpetrators or express an opinion on the subject publicly.<lb/>
From the beginning His Majesty's Government have looked upon this agitation as a sort of transient phase of eccentricity on the part of the United Irish League, troublesome, no doubt, at the time, but not deserving of serious attention. The first manifestation was cattle-driving. I am sure everybody in this House is perfectly tired of the subject, and I can only say that if they lived in Ireland where it prevails they would be very much more tired of it. I think the real importance of the matter has not been sufficiently recognised. The importance is not the injury to the cattle, although that is often very serious and accompanied by acts of considerable cruelty, but it is the intimidatory effect on the owners of the land from which the cattle are driven. The Government did take one step at the beginning, and a very wise one. They increased the forces of the police, especially in the districts in which this offence prevailed. It was a wise step and a useful one. The police were, to a certain extent, able to check the practice and where, as often happened, they were unable to stop it, to identify the people concerned in it and make them amenable to justice. But that was all they could do. When the people were brought to justice they were, as the noble Marquess has mentioned, simply bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. That was absolutely nugatory, for if ten or a dozen young men in a district were bound over in this way there were plenty more to take their place.
I was glad to hear from the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell, that they are now not only bound over to keep the peace, but that the cases are sent to the Assizes. Whether convictions will be obtained or not I do not know, but this shows a greater energy on the part of the Government in dealing with this matter. But their previous action encouraged the idea that they were half-hearted about the matter, and it was urged by some of the delinquents, and even by solicitors engaged on their behalf, that they had the Government at their back; that the Government were so anxious to secure the surrender of grass lands and the breaking of them up among the people, that they did not look too closely at the methods adopted to secure
<col>1116</col>
that object. Those who did not hold this view but saw the immunity with which crime was practised came to the conclusion that the United Irish League was stronger than the law, and that the only way to obtain anything was by violence. Confirmed in this belief the United Irish League proceeded to hold regular courts, to summon obnoxious persons before them, especially those who were guilty of the unpardonable crime of holding land which was coveted by others, and to issue orders to them as to what they were to do; and if they refused or delayed severe boycotting was inflicted upon them. I was therefore very much surprised to see in the newspapers that the right hon. gentleman the Chief Secretary for Ireland stated the other day that the resolutions of the United Irish League were received with contempt in Ireland. They may be received with contempt by His Majesty's Government, and in a great many parts of Ireland, no doubt, they would not be treated with implicit deference; but in any disturbed part it is a very different matter. I do not say they are always obeyed. I know cases myself where people have stood out against the intimidation of the League, some successfully and some not, but those are people in a somewhat higher station of life.
I remember some years ago hearing of an answer that was given by a man who was urged to make a stand against an agitation that was going on. He said, "It is easy for you to talk, living in a big house in a demesne, but if you lived on the roadside in a little cottage with a thatched roof, to which anybody going along the road could set fire in five minutes, you would hold a different view." That is why these people are living in a state of abject terror, and there is no evidence obtainable. We see continually reports of cases of firing into dwelling-houses and firing at the person, and then, at the end, there appear the words, "No arrest has been made." The police are powerless to obtain evidence As an illustration of this I may mention the case of the medical officer in Athenry district. He was called upon by the Crown to give professional evidence in the case of the murder of Constable Goldrick. Since then he has been boycotted in a severe manner. He has lost the greater part of his practice, car-drivers have been warned not to drive him, he personally has been threatened to "mind himself,"
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0584"/>
<col>1117</col>
and he is now living under police protection. If that sort of treatment is meted out to an official witness, your Lordships can imagine what is the case with regard to unofficial witnesses; for it has been always remarked in past times, where similar agitation prevailed, that, while ordinary witnesses who gave obnoxious evidence were subjected to persecution, official witnesses were not molested. In these circumstances it is idle to suppose that the mere increase of police can bring about an appreciable improvement in the state of the country.<lb/>
Here I should like to bear emphatic testimony to the excellent conduct of the police. I myself have been unfortunate enough to have to welcome their services, not for personal protection, but for the protection of people in my employment, and nothing could be better than the arrangements made by the Constabulary officers, or the able, and at the same time, unobtrusive, way in which they were carried out by the men under their command. They do all they can, but with terrorism of this kind they are powerless to put down the agitation that exists. The police can protect a man's life, but they cannot save him from the persecution which renders that life intolerable. They can to a certain extent protect his property, but they cannot secure him in the enjoyment of it, a privilege which every man ought to possess in a civilised country. I sincerely hope that His Majesty's Government will turn their attention to the four counties mentioned, and will adopt some steps which will give that security to life and property which everybody has a right to expect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02631"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure this House does not complain in any way of the Question which the noble Marquess has asked, and my only regret is that the noble Earl who replied on behalf of the Irish Government gave no answer to it. The noble Earl the Lord President dealt with the whole of Ireland. I admit that Ireland, taken as a whole, is in a much more prosperous condition than it was some few years ago, but if the noble Earl will refer to the Question on the Paper he will see that the noble Marquess uses the words, "continuance of acts of lawlessness in various districts in Ireland." Let us stick to these districts, and the worst of them are the county of Galway and the county of Clare. Not only did the noble Earl deal with crime throughout the whole
<col>1118</col>
of Ireland, but he gave us the benefit of his experience of crime throughout the whole of England. That, no doubt, is very interesting, and a great deal of what he said is true, but it has nothing whatever to do with the agrarian crime which is going on in Clare and Galway; and as Ireland is better and more prosperous than it was, surely it would be a great thing if we could see these crimes in those two counties entirely stopped.<lb/>
The Chief Secretary has somewhat changed his manner in dealing with these Questions. Now the cases of crime in Ireland are tabulated for the information of the Opposition. Formerly the Chief Secretary rather resented Questions with regard to such matters, and tried to side track the subject. He also at one time applied certain epithets which were not liked by the Unionist Members who interrogated him. No doubt it is much less trouble to tell off hard-worked officials in the Irish Office to tabulate crime in certain districts in Ireland than to go over to Ireland and set to work to try and suppress that crime. We all know that the present Chief Secretary is rather inclined to be cynical, and what can be more cynical than the tables of crime in these district which decorate the pages of <i>Hansard</i>. I speak more particularly, of course, of the counties of Galway and Clare. If the Chief Secretary is a cynic, I suppose we in Ireland must try and be stoics, and recommend stoicism to these people whose case has been put forward by my noble friend Lord Clonbrock. It is very hard to be a stoic when you have little bits of lead taken out of your body which have been fired from a gun.<lb/>
Let me quote from the pages of <i>Hansard</i> the figures with regard to Galway and Clare. Of indictable offences&#x2014;including firing at the person, killing and maiming cattle, &amp;c., firing into dwellings, threatening letters, &amp;c, and injury to property&#x2014;there were in Galway, East Riding, in the year 1906, 33 agrarian and 52 non-agrarian; and in 1909, 34 agrarian and 37 non-agrarian. In Galway, West Riding, there were, in 1906, 12 agrarian and 32 non-agrarian offences; and in 1909, 45 agrarian and 52 non-agrarian. In Clare there were, in 1906, 29 agrarian and 40 non-agrarian offences. Those figures rose in the year 1907 to 73 agrarian and 76 non-agrarian. In 1908 there was a further rise to 176 agrarian and 90 non-agrarian, and in 1909
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0585"/>
<col>1119</col>
the figures were 109 agrarian and 73 non-agrarian. The figures, of course, are better for the whole of Ireland, but they are not very much better for these two counties.<lb/>
With regard to what the Chief Secretary can do, those acquainted with Ireland know that the position of Ireland's Chief Secretary is unique, especially when he is a member of the Cabinet. His directions are law, and when he goes over to Ireland and desires a thing to be done, the officials of Dublin Castle usually obey his behests. That is my experience, which is a very long one. Has the Chief Secretary used his power to suppress outrage and crime? We on this side of the House say that he has not. Let me take one instance, the dropping of the Peace Preservation Act. There was a long debate in the House of Commons on that subject, and I should like to quote what Mr. Birrell said. Mr. Birrell's words were&#x2014;
<quote>"I have suffered misrepresentation because I have insisted on maintaining my right to carry out Liberal principles, and whilst maintaining the law to the utmost of my power I will not, simply even for the sake of getting a few more convictions than I have been able to do up to the present time, break up the great Liberal tradition and break up my own hopes for the future of Ireland."</quote>
Surely the great Liberal tradition is not to allow people to obtain pistols and guns with the greatest of ease. We all know perfectly well that when the Peace Preservation Act was dropped out of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill there was free trade in pistols, and common pistols could be purchased in the west of Ireland with the greatest of ease. The result now is that in an Irish row a fellow pulls a revolver out of his pocket. In the fight between the O'Brienites and the Redmondites in the recent election pistols were used freely, and the police had to take very strong action indeed to prevent loss of life. This is a new element, and the Government cannot deny that the dropping of the Peace Preservation Act has led to this trade in firearms. If the present Chief Secretary had told his colleagues in the Government that such a thing was going on, nothing would make me believe that the present Government would have allowed it to continue. I know quite well that this Act has not been thought much of by some people, but here was a case where, when it was dropped, the time was regarded as propitious, and this trade in firearms proceeded with very bad results.<lb/>
<col>1120</col>
I should like to quote from a speech which the noble Earl the Leader of the House made on December 18, 1906, when there was a short discussion in your Lordships' House with regard to the omission of the Peace Preservation (Ireland) Act, 1881, from the list contained in the schedule of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. The noble Earl who leads the House then said&#x2014;
<quote>"It always is a grave matter for an Executive Government to undertake a responsibility of this kind. But my right hon. friend the Irish Secretary from his knowledge of the present state of the country thinks he sees his way to undertake it, and, as the noble and learned Lord fairly says, it is with the Government that the responsibility must rest. I should like, however, to protest against the point of view which the noble Lord seemed to take when he said that after all legislation of this kind need not be used, and that if not used it hurt nobody. I am not prepared to admit that. I do not think you can reasonably expect any country to sit down quietly under a system of what I might call <i>in terrorem</i> legislation, which is held in reserve while it behaves well, and left in the cupboard, so to speak, to be pulled out if the country behaves badly. We should not like it in England, and it is not altogether surprising if they do not like it in Ireland."</quote>
That is on the point which Lord Clonbrock made with regard to the dropping of this Act. I hope that we shall have an answer to-night to the inquiry put by the noble Marquess, because I consider that this question of getting firearms very easily has become a most serious one.<lb/>
What has been the effect of this policy? Sixty-nine offences in which firearms were used occurred between January 1 and June 1 this year; informations refused were five, convictions two, persons awaiting trial ten. County Clare has eighteen of such offences. I do not wish to go into the question of boycotting, because I admit that it is most difficult to bring the offenders to justice. When a man gets the cold shoulder it is very hard to find people who will tell about the conspiracy, or do anything at all. It is a terrible weapon to have; but that is another story. If the Government give us a satisfactory answer there is an end of the matter. But the speech which we have heard from the noble Earl was not at all satisfactory. He said that His Majesty's Government take every responsibility. Surely if they take every responsibility, they are responsible for law and order even in those districts in respect of which the noble Earl said we use a magnifying glass to find out crime. No,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0586"/>
<col>1121</col>
my Lords, we do not use a magnifying glass. There is no necessity for that. I am sorry to say that accounts of these outrages appear in the Irish newspapers every day. We should like them stopped.<lb/>
His Majesty's Government know as well as I do how these crimes can be stopped. It was mentioned by a Judge not very long ago that if the ordinary law of the land was put into force these crimes would cease. The ordinary law of the land&#x2014;I allude to the Peace Preservation Act&#x2014;has been dropped. It used to appear in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill and pass through without any comment. I am sorry to say that there are blackguards in Ireland as elsewhere, and especially agrarian blackguards in the west of Ireland. They were sharp enough to know that the Peace Preservation Act had been dropped, and these outrages commenced. It is not pleasant, as the noble Marquess said, to get up and make these statements with regard to Ireland. Things are undoubtedly better than they were, but I hope the Government will try and get the country into the state in which it was when they assumed the Government. We have Purchase Acts which are working very well. I only wish they were working quicker. If the Government do not take measures to stop this lawlessness, of course it will spread.<lb/>
There has been a recrudescence of cattle-driving. The Government know that quite well, and I hope an answer will be given on that subject. It is no good talking about the whole of Ireland. We want a direct answer with regard to the districts to which the noble Marquess has referred. Either you will not do the thing or you will do it. If you will not do what we ask you to do, we must, I suppose, bear it. But if you will do what is asked&#x2014;namely, stop the crime which is going on in these particular districts&#x2014;you will have the thanks of every respectable person in Ireland and of a good many of the Nationalist Members who are your allies. It is well known that the leaders of the Nationalist Party are not entirely in sympathy with this sort of crime. I sincerely hope that His Majesty's Government will give direct answers to the straightforward questions which were put to them by the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02632"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with great diffidence that I venture to
<col>1122</col>
interpose a few observations in this debate, because I suffer from the disadvantage of not having any first-hand knowledge of Ireland, which is possessed to such a marked degree by noble Lords opposite, and I also suffer from other disadvantages. I hope, therefore, that I may be able to claim a special measure of your Lordships' indulgence in the few remarks which I shall address to the House. What strikes me about this debate is the contrast which it presents to a debate which occurred in this Chamber last year. It is true that I had not then the opportunity of hearing that debate from within the House itself, but having to-day studied rather closely the discussion which took place last year&#x2014;no doubt it is within the recollection of many noble Lords sitting here this afternoon&#x2014;I must say the contrast between that debate and this is most striking. This debate in comparison with that seems robbed of all its sting and all its go, and I think it goes far to prove that noble Lords opposite hold very different opinions with regard to our management of Irish affairs than they did last year. One proof of that, I think, is to be found in the limited area which now falls under their criticism, for whereas last year they attempted to show that the condition of Ireland generally was very bad, this year they are careful to indicate that their criticisms only refer to four counties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02633"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will look at the Question which I put eighteen months ago he will see that I used exactly the same expression&#x2014;namely, "various districts"&#x2014;that I use now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02634"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I accept the noble Marquess's explanation, but I was referring at the moment more to the debate which followed than to the speech he actually made on that occasion. At any rate, we now know that in the opinion of all those noble Lords who have addressed the House we ought to confine our attention to the four counties mentioned by the noble Marquess. The fact is that the condition of Ireland improved between the years 1908 and 1909, and the improvement which manifested itself in the latter year has been on the whole maintained during the first six months of this year. If, however, we confine our attention to the counties mentioned by the noble Marquess, far from finding that the general improvement has not manifested itself
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0587"/>
<col>1123</col>
in those counties, I think we shall be able to claim that the general improvement is very largely due to the improvement which has taken place in the four counties specified. I have had given to me a statement of the condition of agrarian outrages in the four counties of Roscommon, Galway, Clare, and Longford, and although it is difficult to convey figures to the House, I think I shall be able to prove my point.<lb/>
Take Roscommon first. In 1908 the agrarian outrages numbered 14; in 1909 the number fell to 5 cases; and for the first half of this year, to June 30, they were also 5. In Galway East and West the figures are 43 and 42 respectively for 1908; these figures fell to 25 and 23 respectively in 1909. In Clare, in 1908, the number of agrarian outrages was 105; that number fell last year to 62. In Longford there were only 2 cases in 1908, and 1 in 1909. That is taking the whole of the agrarian cases. Now look at the figures for cattle-driving. In Roscommon, in 1908, there were 37 cattle-drives, and in 1909 the figure went down to 4. In Galway East there were 65 in 1908, and this number fell to 7 in 1909. In Galway West the number was 41 in 1908, and it fell to 25 in 1909. In Clare, the most disturbed county of all, there were 156 cases in 1908, and only 45 in 1909; and in Longford the number of cases dropped from 16 in 1908 to 5 in 1909. I suggest that that goes to prove that from the general improvement the counties especially under review have not been excepted. An important point to bear in mind when we are considering the number of cases of boycotting is that every case generally includes more than one person, frequently the whole family and the labourers employed. Therefore it is better for the purposes of comparison to take the cases of boycotting and not the number of individuals who fall under the boycotting system. Last year there were 91 persons wholly boycotted, but there were only 17 cases of boycotting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02635"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Is that the whole of Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02636"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Yes. Similarly, in the case of partial boycotts and minor boycotts, the number of individuals is largely in excess of the number of cases; so that I think it is to the case we ought to confine our attention. The noble Marquess opposite asked how many prosecutions there had been for cattle-driving,
<col>1124</col>
and he seemed to take it that the Government had failed to prosecute in these cases and had regarded cattle-driving as a proceeding of not sufficient gravity to call for their best efforts. What happened with regard to cattle-driving in the first half of this year? In eighty-six cases no proceedings were found possible through the difficulty of obtaining evidence. Proceedings were taken in connection with 30 cattle-drives, but there were only 26 distinct prosecutions, some of the persons proceeded against having taken part in more than one drive on the same occasion. In four cases 22 persons have been returned for trial to Assizes charged with unlawful assembly in Galway, West Riding. In two cases proceedings before Justices at Petty Sessions stand adjourned. In 20 cases proceedings were taken before the Resident Magistrates alone, in two of which judgments stand adjourned. The result of these prosecutions is that, of the 213 persons who were brought before the Resident Magistrates, 174 persons were ordered to find bail, 139 of them did find bail, 35 refused to find bail and were imprisoned, and 29 persons were discharged without being required to find bail. I think that shows that the Government do proceed whenever they are able in these cases, and that, having proceeded against these persons, they do take steps to put a stop to the practice of cattle-driving. The number of cattle-drives has decreased considerably. For instance, in the year 1908 there were 681 cattle-drives; in the year 1909 there were 200; and in the half-year to June 30, 1910, there were 116 cattle-drives&#x2014;practically the same percentage as last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02637"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Cattle-driving began under the Liberal <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02638"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I say that since cattle-driving began there has been a great improvement. The figures are, 681 cases for 1908 and 200 last year. That, surely, is an improvement; and the figures for the first half of this year show that the improvement is maintained. It is a great mistake for noble Lords opposite to suppose that the Government are not alive to the necessity for using their utmost efforts to put down these outrages and crimes in Ireland. It would be entirely a mistake to imagine that anything in the policy of the Government leads towards condoning any of the offences
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0588"/>
<col>1125</col>
on which the noble Marquess and others have enlarged. I may say, in support of that, that the present police force has been increased. There were 750 more police on the Royal Irish Constabulary establishment in 1909 than in 1906. Extra police are drafted into the districts where disturbances take place, and a point to be borne in mind is that half of the cost of these extra police falls on the district, and in that way acts as a considerable deterrent in connection with these crimes.<lb/>
Some criticism has been passed, not in your Lordships' House but outside, upon the Government for the reduction in the number of these police, half of the cost of whom is borne by the districts concerned; but under the triennial re-distribution of the Royal Irish Constabulary the Government had no alternative but to take a survey of the probable needs of these districts and so allot the police between them. But even after the triennial distribution was made last year there remain in the affected areas 389 extra police, whose cost is still, to the extent of one-half, borne by those districts. The noble Marquess who raised this question to-day has urged upon the Government the desirability of resorting to more drastic measures to suppress the disturbances to which he has called the attention of the House. I think it is not uninteresting to contrast the condition of affairs in Ireland at the present time with what it was under his administration when he was Viceroy and in possession of the weapon which the Crimes Act gave him. For instance, in 1889, when the noble Marquess was responsible for the government of Ireland, and when, as he has told your Lordships, he was putting into force the full severity of the Crimes Act, I observe that there were 534 cases of agrarian outrage. Now we, without the possession of that engine of repression, only showed 397 acts of agrarian outrage last year.</membercontribution></p>

But when that Government went out of office in 1892 there was not a single case of boycotting in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02640"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I am quite willing to recognise the improvement which the noble Marquess effected. He thinks it was entirely due to the possession of these particular powers.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02642"><member>LORD ASHBY ST.

It takes some time to restore a country which was in the state in which we found Ireland. It was considered extraordinary that we had been able to bring Ireland to the condition in which it was when we left it, considering the state in which we found it when we took office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02644"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I quite appreciate that the noble Marquess thinks time was needed for the operation of the Act to prove its full effect. But we may claim that time is needed for our policy to mature to the full extent. This debate shows, and the noble Marquess's speech shows, that there has been an improvement in Ireland between this year and last year and the year before, and I maintain that that will be continued, and that when we have had a few more years in Ireland the improvement will be extended to these four counties also. The fact of the matter is&#x2014;it is very often said and never contradicted&#x2014;that many of these disturbances are incidental to the land distribution. They are the necessary accompaniment of the Land Act of 1903. It is practically obvious that that Act, beneficent as it has been and great as are the advantages which will be and are being derived from it, has stimulated in Ireland a land hunger, and has led to natural disappointment on the part of those people who expected to have their long cherished desires gratified almost at once. Moreover, a good many of these disturbances are little more than village squabbles over the particular apportionment of the land which the Estates Commissioners are dealing with. A perusal of the details of the cases will show that in many instances they are disputes between rivals for the same plot of land and so
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0589"/>
<col>1127</col>
forth, and, of course, that will disappear as the Estates Commissioners are able to deal one after another with these particular cases. A good deal has been made of cattle-driving and its results. Nobody, of course, can condone cattle-driving, but it is possible, I think, to make too much of it. It is part of a political agitation, and the grazier very often is little inconvenienced by the driving.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02645"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Not by the maiming?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02646"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I said he was not often inconvenienced by the driving of his cattle. They are recovered by the local police, and frequently the grazier does not trouble to turn out of doors to see what has happened. But so far as maiming is concerned, he is entitled to and receives very heavy compensation for any maiming that is done, and that compensation is borne by the rates. I do not mean for a moment to infer that cattle-driving can be defended in any of its aspects, but it is possible to make too much of it. It is a diminishing factor, and we hope that before very long it will have disappeared altogether.<lb/>
A good deal has been said about the Peace Preservation Act. It is true that the Government consented to the lapsing of that Act in 1906, but, as has already been stated, they have under consideration the whole question of the carrying of firearms in this country and in Ireland, and before very long no doubt they will be able to make known their decision to the House. At the same time no one in this debate has directly connected the shooting cases which have occurred with the fact that there is no Peace Preservation Act in Ireland. If people intend to commit the outrages which we have to deplore, no Peace Preservation Act would prevent them getting the arms necessary for the purpose. With regard to the policy of reimposing the Crimes Act, the Government do not feel that there is any necessity at present to resort to this drastic and very undesirable procedure. I think we are entitled to time before you can judge as to the full effect of our policy. No doubt a policy of this kind demands patience, and it is only when that patience is given to the subject that we can hope to settle the Irish question on these lines. I hope I have been able to lay before your Lordships
<col>1128</col>
statistics which go to prove that the condition of Ireland, far from being any worse than it has been in the past, shows, distinct signs of improvement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02647"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we all welcome the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down, and I am sure everyone on this side of the House will hope that it will not be the last speech he will make, but that we may have many opportunities in future of joining with him in debates. The noble Lord commenced with an apology for intervening in the debate. He apologised for the fact that he had no first-hand knowledge of Ireland. That apology I can assure him was quite unnecessary, because if he has no first-hand knowledge of Ireland he is in exactly the same position as every other member of His Majesty's Government. I except, of course, the noble Earl opposite (the Earl of Crewe), and the noble Viscount beside him (Viscount Morley) who does not take part in Irish debates; but at the time those noble Lords were concerned with Ireland I myself was in short petticoats, and therefore I may be allowed to say that their knowledge, though first-hand, is not very new. The noble Lord commented upon what he called the absence of sting in the attack made upon His Majesty's Government in this debate as compared with that of last year. I am sure we are all sorry if we have failed to give noble Lords opposite an attack of the severity which they think the occasion demands, but I can assure them we feel just as bitterly over the condition of a part of Ireland now as we did fifteen months ago.<lb/>
I do not think we have been fairly treated as to our attitude with regard to the area in which disturbances take place. I have never claimed that there have been disturbances in North Antrim. I have never claimed that there have been disturbances in County Wexford. I have never claimed that the whole island was in a state of disturbance. But I have claimed that a large area was in a state of disturbance. I think noble Lords are taking a little too much credit to themselves when they say that our attitude has changed, and that we now only admit that certain areas are disturbed. My recollection is rather the other way. We had enormous difficulty when His Majesty's Government first came into power in getting.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0590"/>
<col>1129</col>
them to admit that any area in Ireland was disturbed at all, and therefore we can congratulate ourselves, I think, that we have made some progress if noble Lords now admit that a certain part of the country is disturbed.<lb/>
The noble Lord went on to argue that even in those four counties the state of affairs is better, but I do not think he went into detail as to why affairs are better in those four counties. Might I suggest two reasons to him? One is that there is no doubt whatever that word was preached by certain Nationalist Members last year that it was desirable that agitation should quiet down in order to give Mr. Birrell a chance in connection with his Land Bill. Do not noble Lords opposite think that those speeches may have affected their statistics? I suggest another reason. Is it not conceivable that in certain districts cattle-driving might have done its work and that therefore it has stopped since the cattle-drivers have got all they want? I am certain that my noble friend Lord Clonbrock, who comes from one of the worst districts in Ireland as regards cattle-driving, could tell your Lordships of actual cases where the men whose cattle have been driven have surrendered, and therefore the cattle-driving has stopped. I suggest these to the Government as two reasons which make their statistics appear better, though they are better not by any action of their own, but rather by their inaction. The Government take the whole credit to themselves, and I am only tempted to ask one question on that point. If you have been able to effect this great improvement, why not complete it and abolish intimidation altogether? If you have some wonderful methods that really are so extraordinarily successful, it is astonishing how slow that success has been.<lb/>
I will only touch on two other points to which the noble Lord referred. He alluded to the state of Ireland in 1889, and both he and the noble Earl the Lord President took great comfort in comparing the state of the country now with what it was in 1889. May I suggest only one point in mitigation of their comparison? We must remember that there was a far greater field for disturbance and agitation in 1889 than there is now, because half of Ireland had not been sold under the Land Purchase Acts, and it is admitted on all sides that where there has been purchase a less favourable
<col>1130</col>
field for agitation exists. I think that is a fair answer to noble Lords when they set up this comparison which seems to give them such lively satisfaction. The only other point in the noble Lord's speech to which I would like to refer was the last point he mentioned&#x2014;the action of the Government in allowing the Peace Preservation Act to lapse, and his claim that the non-use of that Act has had nothing whatever to do with the present outrages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02648"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: No direct connection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02649"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I have here some evidence which I do not wish to place too high because noble Lords opposite naturally will not like it as it is evidence from a Unionist newspaper, and it comes from Birmingham, which from their point of view is worse. The <i>Birmingham Daily Post</i> sent a commissioner over to Ireland last year, and he wrote a number of very interesting articles. I do not know who the commissioner was, but a great deal of his evidence was very impartial. I think I may say that because with some of it I do not myself agree. He happens to deal with this very point. Speaking of the well-known Craughwell murder and another outrage where a policeman had his skull cracked, this is what he says&#x2014;
<quote>"These incidents have excited feelings of much disquietude among the men of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who complain bitterly of the repeal by this Government of the Arms Act under which no person could possess a gun except under licence on the recommendation of two magistrates. Their argument is that the murder of the policeman on the Clanricarde estate would not have taken place had that Act been continued. I am informed that the police know that since the discontinuance of that law there is scarcely a farmhouse in the south and west of Ireland which does not contain a gun&#x2014;not kept for any necessary and legitimate purpose, such as the destruction of vermin, but because of a lawless instinct or a sense that one is needed for protection against lawless neighbours. These weapons, it appears, are of the cheapest kind, purchaseable at about thirty shillings, and the traffic in them, I am informed, has been considerable. Be that as it may, the murder of the policeman on the Clanricarde property is directly attributable to the facilities granted by the present Government for the peasantry of the disturbed counties to possess themselves of arms and ammunition."</quote>
I do not wish to put this too high, but it is the evidence of an observer in Ireland, and it does, at any rate, throw some colour upon our claim&#x2014;a claim that I should have thought almost proved itself&#x2014;that the

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02652"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Not in their use.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02653"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Lord will deny that there is an increase in the seriousness of the offences. I will mention one. The noble Marquess referred to a riot between two forces of Nationalists in County Cork. On that very day there was a more serious outrage in County Clare. A man under police protection was going home accompanied by two policemen and was fired upon with rifles at 600 yards. The rifles were found by the police shortly afterwards close to the place from which they were fired. That is, I submit, an infinitely more serious stamp of offence than that with which we were unfortunately acquainted in previous years. And those rifles could not have been in the possession of those men if the Peace Preservation Act had been in force. I mentioned just now that I thought we had not been quite fairly treated in times gone by with reference to the exact state of Ireland, and I said that at one time we had to complain that the Government were not even ready to admit that there was any disturbance in Ireland at all. Some members of the Government will not even admit it now. I notice that on May 4 the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies made a speech at Reading in which he said that disorder had ceased to exist in Ireland. I merely mention this in passing, as noble Lords opposite have been candid in admitting that there is disorder in certain parts, and I hope the interesting figures which were quoted by the Lord President will be circulated to his colleague with an intimation that it is desirable that he should be a little more accurate in future when he makes speeches on the public platform. No amount of belittling, whether made by junior members of the Government on a public platform or by the Chief Secretary in the House of Commons, can really do away with the truth of the statistics that the Government themselves give us, and more especially
<col>1132</col>
give to our friends in the House of Commons in response to Questions.<lb/>
I do not think the speeches that members of the Government have made this evening have really fairly attacked the gravamen of our charges. As my noble and learned friend Lord Ashbourne stated, there has been no defence of boycotting, or of the Government's inaction in dealing with it, or of the illegal system of the United Irish League set up in opposition to the law of the land. The proceedings of the United Irish League are transacted in open court. The branches of the League meet and dispense what they regard as justice. I have several reports in my hand. Here is an extract from a paper with which some of your Lordships are familiar, the <i>Sligo Champion</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"When the Creevelea Branch of the United Irish League met on January 2, the shopkeeper who was censured at the last meeting came before the meeting, and gave an explanation which was considered satisfactory. It was reported to the meeting that a man from the Tullylougen district is working with the Reymore objectionable. It is expected that the Killargue Branch will take action in this matter, as this man lives within the ambit of their branch. It was also agreed that a Knockacullen man should get a wide berth from the Nationalists in his district."</quote>
The branches of the League have regular sittings, with perfect solemnity and ordinary procedure, just as noble and learned Lords sit in this House to dispense justice; they give their decisions and publish them openly in the Nationalist newspapers circulating in the district. They are not isolated decisions tucked away in the corner of the newspaper, but they fill columns and columns in every issue. Since the cattle-driving conspiracy grew up under His Majesty's Government these resolutions have attained to a depth of formality which is inconceivable compared with the record of previous years. I was glad to hear my noble friend Lord Clonbrock protest against an expression used by the Chief Secretary the other day in the House of Commons that these resolutions were treated with contempt in Ireland. They are the weapon and the machinery by which the United Irish League does all its work. I venture to say that the decisions of the courts of the United Irish League in those parts of Ireland which we are discussing to-day are treated with far more respect than the Courts of His Majesty.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Lord President took us to task for drawing attention to this
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0592"/>
<col>1133</col>
state of affairs, but it is a little difficult to persuade oneself how attacks upon a system can possibly do the same harm as the Government's passive acceptance of it. The effect upon individuals is a most unhappy one. But might I suggest that the effect on the nation of the inability of His Majesty's Government to deal effectively with the questions before them is infinitely more serious. In England if a man fails to pay his rent the Courts deal with him at once. The Courts will not touch a man who fails to pay his rent in those parts of Ireland which we are discussing if he has the United Irish League at his back. The noble Lord opposite who addressed your Lordships for the first time described what takes place as "village squabbles," causing little inconvenience to the grazier. May I trouble your Lordships with one more extract from a Nationalist newspaper? It is an example of a "village squabble causing little inconvenience to the grazier." There is a particularly brutal case of boycotting on the borders of Ulster known as the Arva case. The two men boycotted have committed the terrible crime of inheriting from their father farms from which somebody many many years ago was evicted. No agitation was started in connection with the case until the locality realised that Mr. Birrell's appointment as Chief Secretary gave them a favourable opportunity for agitation. This is a description taken from the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of February 5&#x2014;
<quote>"Friday last was fair day in Arva. William McNeill, the boycotted man in Aughavas, with his usual bodyguard of police and two emergencymen, entered the town about 12 noon. About the same hour Francis Cooke, better known as ' Teapot ' Cooke, also made his appearance, closely guarded by police and accompanied by an emergencyman. Their entrance to the town was heralded by booing, cheering, and blowing of horns, which drew the attention of the people attending the fair, and was the means of gathering the crowd around the obnoxious gentlemen."</quote>
A large force of police was present. The report continues&#x2014;
<quote>"On that day week McNeill visited Arva in search of provisions. After being refused in Duncan's"&#x2014;</quote>
evidently the name of one of the shops&#x2014;
<quote>"for the goods, he tried Keith's, who has since supplied him, and is now rigorously boycotted. Early that day a deputation of young men from the Aughavas Branch of the United Irish League went through the town and warned the shopkeepers not to supply McNeill with any goods, as he was boycotted by the League for grabbing the farm at Aughavas, from which Dominick Maguire was evicted some years ago, and which he refused
<col>1134</col>
to give up after being requested to do so several times. No one in Arva would give him any support except one, and he is now enjoying a solitary existence."</quote>
That is a concrete case, given in the words of a Nationalist newspaper. It shows what happened in the case of two men, whose sole crime is that they own land which they have inherited and from which somebody was once evicted. When they come in on market day to purchase their provisions they are followed by this booing crowd, who prevent them from getting provisions in any shop except one, and that shopkeeper is immediately put under the ban of the United Irish League. Surely it is grossly unfair to describe that as a village squabble.</membercontribution></p>

We must not forget that there is the national as well as the individual point of view, and that if you educate the people into believing that while they have a political organisation at their back they are safe from the operation of the law of the land, it is just possible that the public Exchequer may suffer disadvantage from that theory if it is accepted and allowed to be deeply ingrained in the minds of the people. Under the Purchase Acts the security for the payment of the annuities is the land itself, and though I have always strongly believed that there is no great likelihood of any large repudiation of purchase annuities, it is not a very long step for the agitator to take when he finds his business decreasing through the diminution in the number of landlords, to start an agitation against the State with similar weapons as those which he is now using against landlords. Remember that the law of the United Irish League is that no man is to occupy an evicted holding, that no man is to be the caretaker of an evicted holding, that no man is to temporarily graze an evicted holding, and that no man is to bid at an auction for an evicted holding when it is for sale. If the Government had to sell such a holding through failure to pay the
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0593"/>
<col>1135</col>
annuity, not due to the inability of the occupier so much as to the encouragement he has received from agitators, the Government would be in considerable difficulty in dealing with it if the United Irish League were still able to enforce the rules which they have made and which they now enforce with almost absolute impunity in the districts under discussion.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, and several of your Lordships have referred to the dislike of the Government to use what I believe to be the proper weapon, what is familiarly called, though misnamed, the Crimes Act. But the noble Marquess also drew attention to the fact, and I only wish to enforce it, that this Government do not make full use of the ordinary law apart from the Crimes Act. A number of statistics have been quoted to your Lordships, and I do not wish to trouble you with any more; but the figures given in the House of Commons on June 30 by Mr. Birrell are eloquent as to the failure of the Government to prosecute in cases in which they should prosecute. The stock answer is that they do not prosecute because they cannot get evidence. Why can they not get evidence? For one reason only&#x2014;the people who can give evidence do not feel that they will get security from the Government after they have given evidence. The confidence of the people in the Government to protect them has gone. So long as that want of confidence in the Government exists you will fail to get evidence. Lord Justice Cherry himself, who I am sure noble Lords opposite would not expect us to think is too much prejudiced in favour of law and order, in the last two days, in an address to the Grand Jury at his first Assizes, complained of this, and said it was due in great measure to the system of intimidation which exists. That system of intimidation could be put down now just as it was put down by the Unionist Government. I think we are entitled to ask, How much longer is this farce to go on of having a Chief Secretary to govern Ireland when he refuses to use the powers that are in his hands and which in past years have proved effective?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02656"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may be forgiven at this stage for joining in the debate to say a few words, although, as the noble
<col>1136</col>
Earl who has just sat down pointed out, my knowledge of Ireland is not quite so recent as his own or that of other noble Lords opposite. At the same time it is somewhat more recent than the noble Earl implied, because I think he said he was in short frocks when my noble friend and I were in Ireland. As a matter of fact, I think that in the year when we left Ireland the noble Earl had reached the substantial age of twenty years.<lb/>
This debate, like all other recent debates we have had on the state of Ireland, although, as has been pointed out, it differs from some previous debates in material respects, really can be concentrated on the one question as to whether His Majesty's Government are or are not prepared to bring the Crimes Act into operation in certain parts of Ireland. That, I think, was the general effect of the question put by the noble Marquess and it has been once more enforced by the speech of the noble Earl who has just sat down. The noble Earl said it had been proved that the Crimes Act would do away with crime in such districts as those which have been mentioned in the course of the debate, and in which it is not disputed that an undesirable condition of affairs exists. I may say, in passing, that it is not even accurate to speak of four counties as being disturbed. So far as anything like a dangerous or even what may be called a serious state of affairs can be said to exist, it appears to be confined to three districts in the county of Clare and to a considerable part of the East Riding of Galway. As regards this often argued question of the Crimes Act, the noble Marquess who introduced this discussion said that when he left Ireland and was succeeded by the next Viceroy, Lord Zetland, there was no boycotting in Ireland. That, so far as I can recollect, is accurate, but to speak of Ireland as being then in a condition of complete peace would surely not be accurate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02657"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I left Ireland in 1889. I meant that when the Conservative Government of which I was a member went out of office it was admitted that they left Ireland free from boycotting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02658"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes. Bat I was going to say that there were when we arrived, and there continued to be
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0594"/>
<col>1137</col>
during our term of office, a considerable number of persons under police protection. From my recollection I am inclined to think that if those who were completely protected and those who were protected by patrols were added together the number must have run into hundreds, and therefore it would not be accurate to regard the condition of Ireland when we went there in 1892 as one of profound peace and contentment, because there were at that time parts of Ireland which gave and continued to give during our term of office no small anxiety. Something has been said of boycotting, and the noble Earl, Lord Mayo, admitted most fairly and frankly that to deal with boycotting successfully is one of the most difficult tasks which can be set to any Government. There is no doubt that the more coarse and violent forms of boycotting may conceivably be dealt with under the Acts which make conspiracy penal, but when you come to the more refined but not less painful expositions of boycotting it is an exceedingly difficult thing for the law to deal with.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has just sat down spoke of what he called the courts held by the United Irish League at which resolutions were passed. Does the noble Earl mean to convey to us that when proceedings which we may think undesirable take place at those meetings that they would lay those who take part in them open to prosecution for conspiracy, and that the authorities in Ireland have omitted so to prosecute? Because unless he means this, or unless he means that the League itself ought to be forthwith proclaimed as an illegal organisation, he does not offer any solution of the situation of which he complains. The noble Earl mentioned the Arva case, and gave it, I think, as a typical case. The circumstances, so far as I am aware of them, as regards the complaint against these brothers are as the noble Earl stated, but it is certainly not a typical case, because it seems, from the information which I have, to be one of an extremely unusual character. This particular case has reached rather the dimensions of a feud than of an ordinary boycotting case, because I understand that no fewer than sixty persons are included in the boycott list&#x2014;eight of the one family, the remainder of the sixty being their friends and supporters. But I am not able to speak
<col>1138</col>
at length of the case, because I understand that as a matter of fact criminal proceedings for riot are now pending against the people who in the town endeavoured to prevent supplies being forthcoming to the McNeill family, and since then the police say that the general position has improved and that they hope that the particular trouble may die down.<lb/>
We are accused, not only of not applying the Crimes Act, but of not applying the ordinary law; and when we do not prosecute because we say it is useless to go on prosecuting in cases where no evidence is forthcoming, the noble Earl goes on to say that evidence is not forthcoming because those who give evidence are not secure. What exactly is the nature of that charge? The noble Earl can hardly mean that those who give evidence in such cases do not receive the ordinary measure of police protection. It has always been the case, I suppose, ever since there have been disturbances in Ireland, that those who have given evidence in cases of a certain kind have undergone some degree of risk. I dare say the noble Earl knows as well as I do that there have been cases in which people have been altogether taken away from the neighbourhood and have disappeared from the society in which they moved and have been provided for elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02659"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: What was in my mind was that they are in danger of the boycotting, from which they feel they do not get protection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02660"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: But surely that is arguing in a circle, because the noble Earl's prescription for putting down boycotting is, I understand, the bringing into operation of the Crimes Act, and nothing else. He has no other suggestion, so far as I know, to offer, and therefore we come back to the question as to the renewal of the Crimes Act. I do not want to repeat what I have often said before at this Table, but I do not think it can be regarded as proved that the proceedings possible under the Crimes Act ever have in the past succeeded, or if they were now applied would really succeed, in putting down a particular class of crime. The noble Marquess spoke of the gradual improvement which took place under the operation of the Crimes Act. But when the noble Viscount and
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0595"/>
<col>1139</col>
I were in Ireland we got on for three years without putting the Crimes Act into force, and therefore it seems to me a large and not a very reasonable assumption to suppose that particular classes of crime can be put down by the application of the Crimes Act. Ireland was not, I am sorry to say, altogether free from crime in our time. The county of Clare, for instance, was in a disturbed condition, and there was at different times a great deal of firing into dwellings and of crime of that kind, but it certainly never seemed to us that we should effect anything in cases of that class by bringing into operation even that provision of the Crimes Act to which allusion has been made in the course of the debate, and which I have always regarded as being in itself a quite unobjectionable provision&#x2014;namely, that of instituting an inquiry without having a prisoner before the Court. It is only, I think, in rare instances, and in instances of a totally different kind, that even that provision would, in our opinion, be usefully applied.<lb/>
But the reason that I interrupted the noble Marquess in his opening observations was that I was anxious to know, with regard to the particular class of offences of firing at the person&#x2014;that is, firing a shot from behind a dyke&#x2014;or firing into dwellings, when, as noble Lords opposite are aware, it is not very often possible even to suspect an attempt at murder, whether there has ever been a time, Crimes Act or no Crimes Act, when convictions have habitually been obtained in respect of those two classes of offences. My impression is that the failure to bring offenders to justice is not owing so much to the difficulty of getting evidence, although that, of course, is a factor in the case, but to the special circumstances under which those particular crimes are committed, which obviously make conviction exceedingly difficult.<lb/>
I do not think I need dwell further upon the question of cattle-driving, which by common admission is dying out. I do not say that it is altogether extinct, but so far as I am able to judge there is this difference, that there undoubtedly was a time when cattle-driving, as my noble friend behind me said, represented something like concerted political action; but now I am glad to think that where cattle-drives occur they take place in connection with particular disputes on particular estates,
<col>1140</col>
and though they remain, of course, a most reprehensible and undesirable form of agrarian quarrel, this can no longer, except in rare cases, be said to be anything like an organised policy.<lb/>
The next point is the demand for the renewal of the Peace Preservation Act. It was the view of the Government when they took the step of dropping that Act that it was in the nature of an experiment which could only be justified by its success. It has been pointed out that in one respect firearms are now more easily obtained in Ireland than they are in England, because the Act for which the noble Earl opposite was, I think, responsible in 1903 does not apply to Ireland, and therefore the would-be purchaser of a pistol is in a better position there than he would be here. But I am inclined to think the noble Earl would agree that if there is anything wrong in Ireland the mere application of that Act to Ireland would not remedy the evil. It might do something towards it, but I do not feel that the mere introduction into Ireland of the provision which I think is the main feature of that Act&#x2014;that only the possessor of a gun licence may buy a pistol&#x2014;would cause a very sensible diminution in the number of pistols in Ireland. So far as crimes of a serious nature are concerned, I do not believe that the dropping of the Act has any effect one way or the other. Persons who intended to fire at anybody or into dwelling-houses have not been deterred from doing so by the existence of the Act, and have always been able to possess themselves of firearms for the purpose, Peace Preservation Act or no Peace Preservation Act. But I am quite willing to admit the danger which may attach in a fray or riot of any kind to an indiscriminate possession of firearms. There always has been too much of it in Ireland as well as in England. Even when the Peace Preservation Act was in force&#x2014;I believe the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, will bear me out&#x2014;pistols were very freely used, though not for purposes of murder, although there have been, of course, grave cases in which they have been used in actual riots. I do not complain of a certain degree of impatience on the part of noble Lords opposite on this question. I think myself that it is one that ought to be dealt with not specially in relation to Ireland, because I do not believe that there is anything in the state of Ireland which calls for
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0596"/>
<col>1141</col>
special urgency in the matter. But I shall be very glad when those of my right hon. friends who are concerned with this matter find it possible to deal with the whole question of the possession of firearms in the United Kingdom in a complete and reasonable way.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord MacDonnell, who I think is no longer in the House, dealt fully and well with the position created by the passing of the Land Act of last year, which, though not, of course, the subject of this debate, yet is in some respects germane to it. I have no desire to add anything to what he said, but I cordially agree with what fell from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, when he said that land purchase in Ireland tended to make for peace. I fully believe that is so, and I think that whatever may be the objections on different grounds, financial and other, to the policy of land purchase, that fact is one of the great defences of that policy. But, as has often been pointed out, it will not bring about the millennium in Ireland. I do not believe that even if the whole of Ireland was in the hands of peasant proprietors&#x2014;a state of things which I have no desire myself to see brought about&#x2014;agrarian disputes would be entirely got rid of, because in any country where attachment to the land is so strong cases of differences which appear trivial to outsiders will sometimes lead to serious and even violent disputes. I suspect that among the peasant proprietors in many parts of the Continent of Europe evidence could be adduced in proof of what I have said, but I do not at all deny the pacifying effect of the various Purchase Acts, beginning with that for which the noble and learned Lord who sits opposite was responsible.<lb/>
All I think we have a right to ask in discussing these matters is that they should be discussed, as they have been to-night, in a spirit of moderation and without exaggeration. Several of my noble friends behind me have drawn attention to the remarkable difference between the tone of the debate this year and the debate of last year. Certainly I am far from being disposed in any way to twit noble Lords with that. I am only thoroughly glad that it should be so. They have laid before us in measured language what they consider to be the defects of our policy, but they have not broken out into the somewhat
<col>1142</col>
extravagant denunciations to which we have been used in former years. I contrast, for instance, the speech which the noble Earl who immediately preceded me to-night made last year, when, in speaking of the Craughwell murder, he used language to which I think this House is unaccustomed, in which he said that the Chief Secretary must bear a considerable part of the moral blame for that horrible assassination, and he went on to ask how many murders of that kind were to be committed before the Government moved. I am glad to say that that dreadful crime has not found a parallel since. I am afraid that the district in which it took place is in a thoroughly bad state, and that the district of Athenry is honeycombed by a dangerous and pernicious secret society. That is a state of things which, as we know, has always existed in certain conditions of local feeling. But, speaking generally, I think we may say that there are signs, except in those one or two black spots, not merely of a diminution in the statistics of crime, but also of a better and more reasonable spirit; and we may look forward without any real dread of a recrudescence of crime to the future, and also with hope to the steady operation of the Land Act which was made law last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02661"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend who introduced this question to-night at the outset of his remarks said somewhat pathetically that, though he had often had occasion to call the attention of this House to the state of Ireland, he had never yet received what he regarded as an adequate answer from the Bench opposite. I am not quite sure whether my noble friend will be better satisfied with the answer which he has received this evening. I gather that it has two limbs to it. We are told, in the first place, that these disorders are purely local; and, in the second place, that they are less frequent than they have been. We can readily concede that the trouble is a local one, and, of course, it goes without saying that cattle-driving is not likely to be resorted to except in districts where there are grazing farms and consequently where there are cattle to be driven. Then with regard to the question of improvement, I think the figures that show improvement require to be, to some extent, at any rate, discounted by the fact that there are certain districts in which notoriously a condition of apparent quiet has been brought about by
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0597"/>
<col>1143</col>
the triumphant successes of these local organisations. It is the old story: You create a solitude and you call it peace. And it has, again, to be remembered that in those areas where purchase has been carried out on an extensive scale the result has been, as Lord Ashbourne pointed out, at once to get rid of a great many of these old-standing difficulties. But, making allowance for all these facts, we are, I think, justified in contending that within these comparatively restricted areas a condition of things still exists which can only be described as scandalous and intolerable. I think the noble Earl took credit to His Majesty's Government for the diminution in the number of cattle-drives. It may be that the statistics show some diminution, but I am told that already in this year no fewer than 119 of these operations have taken place. Surely that is not a figure which can fill anybody with unbounded satisfaction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02662"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think it is only fair to add that in those statistics of cattle-driving are included very small operations when only a few cattle are driven out of a field into the road.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02663"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That may be so; but, on the other hand, there are some operations which I can only describe as of the most atrocious character&#x2014;operations which would be condemned by all right-thinking people, not only on account of what you may describe as their social and political effect, but on account of the ruthless barbarity and cruelty with which they are carried out. The other evening we were morally shedding tears over the maltreatment of decrepit horses that are conveyed to the Continent, but do your Lordships imagine that any of those horses suffer greater cruelty and more abominable ill-usage than do some of those bullocks which are hunted about the country and left in a state of exhaustion by the roadside?<lb/>
With regard to this question of cattle-driving, noble Lords opposite must really excuse us if we remind them that cattle-driving is a development which has taken place since they came into office. The thing was unknown in Ireland. We call to mind the admission of the present Chief Secretary that he found Ireland, I think the expression was, "peaceful and crimeless," while, unless my memory fails me, his predecessor dwelt with satisfaction on
<col>1144</col>
the fact that Ireland had never been in a quieter condition since the days of Strongbow. Since those days all these malpractices have grown up, and our contention is&#x2014;and we shall continue to maintain it&#x2014;that if these practices had not been Weakly and irresolutely dealt with the thing might have been crushed out of existence in its earlier stages. I do not suggest, of course, that His Majesty's Ministers have condoned these offences, but I do suggest that they have never adequately appreciated the gravity of them, and that has been shown by their conduct and by their language. One noble Lord behind me referred just now to a statement made by the present Chief Secretary which was, I think, to the effect that resolutions of the United Irish League denouncing particular individuals were regarded with contempt in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02664"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: "Sometimes treated with contempt," was, I think, the phrase the Chief Secretary used.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02665"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think I noticed that qualification.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02666"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: There is no word "sometimes" in <i>Hansard</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02667"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend behind me fortunately has the text of the Chief Secretary's statement, in which the qualifying word apparently does not occur. And what a revelation that was when this evening the noble Earl who spoke earlier in the debate compared these Irish cattle-drives with the case of the mutilation of cattle in Staffordshire a few years ago! Does the noble Earl seriously think that there is any comparison between the two things? I would venture to say that if the people of Staffordshire had been able to catch the person who perpetrated those offences he would have had a very good chance of being lynched on the spot. What is the case in Ireland? A cattle-drive takes place. Half the population is probably mixed up in it, and the other half is afraid to give evidence or take any steps in vindication of the law.<lb/>
The noble Earl said just now that in his view the sole question between us was whether His Majesty's Government were justified in not putting the Crimes Act into force. I do not desire this evening to revive that controversy. We, of course,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0598"/>
<col>1145</col>
have always held that His Majesty's Government had a weapon ready to their hand that they might have used, and the use of which would probably have put an end to the state of things of which we complain so much. The noble Earl differs from us. He told us last year that the Crimes Act was a "rotten weapon." I think that was the expression he used. We do not think it is a rotten weapon. We believe it is an effectual weapon, and we are inclined to suggest that it is a Statute which can be put into force without really doing any wrong or injustice to the law-abiding people of the country in which it operates. I have always been led to believe that the greater part of the provisions of the Crimes Act are to be found in the ordinary Scottish law, and, if that is so, what conceivable reason can there be for not setting in force provisions of the law which have been tried before in Ireland and which have not been found wanting in efficacy? But, as I said just now, I do not wish to revive that old controversy.<lb/>
I desire, however, before I resume my place, to say one word about another Statute&#x2014;the Peace Preservation Act. That Act was passed by a Liberal Government in the year 1881 for the purpose of placing necessary restrictions upon the possession and use of arms and explosives. It was kept in operation, and it was tightened up, if I may say so, in 1886 by the noble Viscount opposite (Lord Morley), and I have no doubt quite properly tightened up; and it was defended by him a few years later on the ground that he did not regard it as a measure of coercion but as a measure of police regulation. That is how we regard it; and assuming, as we assume, that you wish to eschew coercion in all shapes, we cannot see, given the condition of things which exists in parts of Ireland, why you should not use this useful measure of police regulation which the noble Viscount regarded with so much favour not many years ago. You allowed that Act to lapse, and if anything appears clearly from the Irish statistics it is that the moment when that Act ceased to operate was the moment when the tide turned in regard to all these crimes accompanied by the use of fire-arms. I am not going to inflict statistics on the House at this hour, but I take a comparison. In 1905, the year before the lapse of the Act, including firing at the person and into dwellings and agrarian and non-agrarian cases, the
<col>1146</col>
number of offences was 29; in 1908 the number was 132, and last year it was 84. The noble Earl who spoke just now repeated an observation that he has made in this House, to the effect that the wide distribution of firearms has very little to do with agrarian crime. He puts it this way, I think, that a man who wants to commit a serious outrage can always get a weapon to commit it with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02668"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Rather more than that&#x2014;that the class of man who commits this kind of outrage always possesses a firearm whether there is an Act or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02669"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: But that is not our point. Our point is that, given a condition of disorder in a certain part of the country, that condition becomes immensely aggravated if firearms are scattered about all over the country and are to be found in the pocket of every peasant on the hillside. There have been cases which prove that to the hilt. A noble Lord who spoke earlier referred to a particularly dangerous riot which took place at Newmarket in the South of Ireland, at which pistols were produced and bullets were whizzing about all over the place, with the result that a harmless spectator was killed. Surely that is not a condition of things that anyone can regard with much satisfaction. I do venture to say this, that however much you may dislike the idea of coercive measures there is really no coercion, in the true sense of the word, in placing restrictions on the use of firearms. The wide distribution of firearms and their extreme cheapness all over the world seem to me to be one of the most unfortunate results of modern civilisation. The noble Viscount knows what the wide distribution of firearms in India and in the countries adjoining India means. We are spending many thousands of pounds in endeavouring to stop gun running in the Persian Gulf. Surely it is a perfectly reasonable policy to apply anywhere to say that you shall not be allowed to buy these cheap pistols and cheap rifles, particularly if the state of the country is such as to make it undesirable that these additional incentives to disorder should be supplied. I notice with satisfaction that His Majesty's Government apparently intend to deal with this question of the possession of firearms&#x2014;I presume by a measure of general
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0599"/>
<col>1147</col>
application. I do not care whether it is of general application or not, provided it applies to an extent sufficient to deal with the evil where it notoriously exists.<lb/>
I will say only one word more before I sit down. These Irish disorders are to some extent excused to-night upon the ground that they are the accompaniment of a transitional state of things&#x2014;a state of things which I have heard the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack describe as "an agrarian revolution." It is perfectly true that an agrarian revolution is going on in Ireland, an agrarian revolution eminently advantageous to the occupiers of land in that country. I doubt whether, in the history of the world, any concessions have been made to the rural population in any country equal to those which have been placed within the reach of the people of Ireland under the recent Land Purchase Acts. And what I venture to suggest to His Majesty's Government is that these concessions, so generously facilitated by the liberality of the people of this country, carry with them a double obligation&#x2014;an obligation, in the first place, upon the peasants in whose interests they are made to show themselves by their conduct worthy of the sacrifices that have been made for their sakes, and an obligation, in the next place, upon His Majesty's Government to see that this great experiment gets fair play and is carried out under conditions which will give it a fair and reasonable prospect of success. It is only the people of Ireland who can decide for themselves whether by their conduct they will show themselves worthy of all that which has been done for them; but it is possible for His Majesty's Government, by
<col>1148</col>
showing not only sympathy and generosity, but firmness in the dealings with crime and disturbance, to ensure something like fair conditions for the great agricultural experiment which is now in progress. It seems to me that His Majesty's Government are open to this charge, that they have sometimes forgotten the extent of that obligation, and that in their desire to avoid action which might be criticised or render them unpopular in Ireland, they have allowed a condition of things to arise and continue which in any properly governed country would have been dealt with vigorously and firmly at the outset.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02691">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02692"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading follows generally the Acts of 1900 and 1890. It applies, as both of those Acts did, to Scotland as well as to England, but it does not apply to
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0601"/>
<col>1151</col>
Ireland. There is a separate Bill in the name of my noble friend Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, under which the Irish census is taken in rather a different manner. The Bill the Second Reading of which I am now moving does not in itself call for much comment. There are, however, two important points in which it differs from its predecessors.<lb/>
The present Bill requires that the schedule to be filled up by the householder should include, in the case of married persons, particulars indicating the duration of the marriage and the number of children born of the marriage who are still living. A good deal of importance is attached to these figures by the medical authorities and also by some of the statistical authorities, who think that by the help of these figures interesting information will be secured. The Bill also requires that the number of rooms inhabited shall be specified in each case. It is thought that over crowding is not confined to tenements of four rooms, and information on this subject will be useful.<lb/>
I suppose the cheers which greeted the Bill just now indicated that in the opinion of some noble Lords opposite it is remarkable rather for what it does not, than what it does, provide. I suppose that there will be some criticism as to the omission of the religious census. That is an old question which has been raised time after time, and on each occasion this House, as well as the other House of Parliament, has decided that it is unnecessary to ask for these particulars. At any rate noble Lords opposite as well as ourselves are equally guilty in this respect. In 1890 a Departmental Committee was appointed to inquire into the question, and in their Report they said&#x2014;
<quote>"Representations have been made both in favour of and against the census of religious profession in Great Britain. In other countries and in our Colonies such information is obtained, but reasons of a political character have been urged against returns under this head, and we are not in a position to make any recommendation regarding the matter."</quote>
When the Bill of 1890 was before the House of Commons the then Leader of the House opposed the taking of a religious census on the ground that it would cause heat, and to a certain extent, ill-feeling.<lb/>
Then there was a debate in your Lordships' House inaugurated by the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, who was very
<col>1152</col>
anxious that these figures should be asked for; but the late Lord Salisbury, who was then Leader of the House, suggested various difficulties that might arise and inquired whether it might not be necessary to obtain certificates of the religious belief of an individual from his two senior female relatives. The result of that discussion was that the Motion was withdrawn. The question was not raised again, and the Bill went through Second Reading and Committee in your Lordships' House without any difficulty at all. The then Archbishop of Canterbury took part in the discussion, but refrained from pressing the Government to obtain these particulars. I would venture to impress upon your Lordships that there is a very large number of people in this country who would really believe it improper for the State to ask such questions, and a very large number of them would certainly refuse to give the information. We believe that in those circumstances the value of the statistics would be very considerably diminished.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite, I am sure, will see that the value of the statistics which are obtained in the various Dominions where these particulars are asked for is so far invalidated by the number of people who refuse to answer the question. We think that the census should apply only to matters of fact that can be easily answered and to which no individual would object. We admit that these particulars are required in Ireland, but there the case is somewhat different. Noble Lords opposite admitted that last evening, when they said that even cattle maiming was different in England from what it was in Ireland. The circumstances in the two countries are so far different that we trust they will be accepted as a sufficient reason for making a difference in regard to this, matter. I submit that the inclusion of this request in this Bill would certainly not tend to peace between the various churches and denominations in this country, and therefore it is advisable that we should follow the example of previous Governments and not ask for these particulars.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02694"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl, with that intuition which comes from years of official experience, has correctly anticipated the criticism which will
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0602"/>
<col>1153</col>
be indulged in with regard to this measure. We live at the present day in an age of statistics; We are perpetually endeavouring to obtain information, useless or the reverse, upon every variety of subject except that of the religion of the people, which we are forbidden to obtain unless we happen to live in Ireland. The relation of religion to population is universally recognised as one of the most interesting facts of the present day. I observe that the President of the Local Government Board claims that in forming an exception to the rest of the world we show our good sense. But if that is correct, it shows not only that good sense is very sparsely distributed throughout the universe, but that this country and Scotland have a monopoly of it. I have made some inquiries into the matter, and I find that in every country in Europe, with the exception of France, and I believe in every British Colony without exception, a religious census is taken, and in no quarter is any opposition raised to it.<lb/>
In this country we enjoy, or it is supposed that we enjoy because we have no means of ascertaining the fact, a larger number of religious denominations than any other country, and the fact of there being so large a variety of these denominations has led to difficulties with which everybody is well acquainted with regard to education and other matters. It is an open secret, in fact it is blazoned, so to speak, upon the housetops, that as soon as the Government feel themselves strong enough to undertake the task, they will attempt to disestablish the Church in Wales. That being the case, surely it is obvious that an impartial religious census is much more required in this country than in any other. One would naturally suppose that the first thing that people interested in this subject would desire would be that there should be an impartial set of figures to which they could refer. Failing an official census, you are depending upon amateur censuses which irresponsible people are always prepared to take. In Wales, for example, which is the most striking instance, the political Nonconformists are only too glad to number themselves. In fact, if they get the opportunity, they are quite prepared to count themselves several times over. But, on the other hand, they have the strongest and most insuperable objection to their opponents being counted by an official authority.<lb/>
<col>1154</col>
Putting Wales temporarily aside, I should like, if the House will permit me, to deal shortly with the objections which have been hitherto brought forward by the Government and their supporters to including a religious census. First of all, we have the fine old crusted Front Bench objection that they are not going to require these particulars because their predecessors did not require them, and that because the Government in 1890 would not give the figures they are not going to be silly enough to do anything of the kind themselves. In no circumstances would that statement make a deep impression upon me. But the circumstances are totally different. The reason why the figures Were not asked for in 1890 was that there was very little time, but that is an excuse which cannot be pleaded at the present moment, because it is obvious that the House of Commons has great difficulty in finding sufficient work to do. That is one argument which is already disposed of.<lb/>
Then there is the so-called inquisitorial objection on which the noble Earl laid considerable stress. I may say, to start with, that any objection relating to an inquisitorial inquiry comes with singularly bad grace from the present Government, who have appointed hordes of officials for the purpose of prying into persons' private affairs. But as a matter of fact a census, in itself, is an extremely inquisitorial proceeding and cannot very well be otherwise, and it becomes increasingly so every time that one is taken. Is it not, for instance, an invidious thing to ask a man whether he is deaf or an imbecile and how many bedrooms his family occupy? Is it not an invidious and delicate thing to ask a woman her age? The majority of persons who have reached a certain period of life would far prefer to be asked what their religion is than their age. The fact is that it is an extremely delicate matter to put inquiries of this kind to either sex. I have heard on good authority of a noble Lord, a well-known member of this House, who was so appalled when filling up the census paper at the prospect of having to put the question as to her age to a lady occupying an important position in his household, that sooner than do it he took train and never stopped until he reached Naples. But there is a more serious side of this question. It stands to reason that working-men, for instance, are naturally apt to make their age out to be lower than
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0603"/>
<col>1155</col>
it really is so as to secure better chances of employment.<lb/>
But inquiries of this kind do not by any means exhaust the inquisitorial nature of the queries which it is proposed to put. In view of the dropping of the birth-rate at the present moment the Local Government Board are in this census instituting inquiries into what they call the comparative fertility of married couples in various social positions and of different ages. For my part I should have thought it was difficult to devise a more inquisitorial inquiry than this. It is obvious that there are many heads of families who have larger families than they can legitimately account for, and it is possible, in view of the method of inquiry, that the Local Government Board might appear to think their families were too small. But in either case it is difficult to see what effect these inquiries can have. It may be interesting to the Local Government Board, but what practical effect the information can have upon the birth-rate of this country passes my comprehension altogether. With regard to inquisitorial inquiries, I do not suppose it would be denied that a woman living alone is liable to be asked whether she is divorced or separated from her husband, and whether she has borne any children. Could there be anything more inquisitorial than these inquiries? Yet the Government come to us and say that while the ordinary individual, however fastidious and sensitive of nature, is going to submit to these interrogatories without wincing, a question with respect to his or her religion would be regarded as an intolerable insult.<lb/>
In addition to this particular form of objection, it is contended occasionally that persons, chiefly domestic servants, would be in danger of losing their places if their religious denomination was disclosed. The imaginary victim of religious intoleration I imagine to be some housemaid or nurse who has successfully masqueraded for years as a member of the Church of England, but who is detected by a lynx-eyed head of the household when the census paper has to be filled up, and is forthwith dismissed with ignominy. I fail to believe that such establishments exist; but, even if they do, the grievance must be an imaginary one, because if anyone did hold these intolerant and tyrannical ideas it would be a condition of service, and therefore the contingency which is
<col>1156</col>
feared could never arise. There is yet another objection of a somewhat ingenious nature which I observe was raised in another place. It was pointed out that there are a number of persons in this country who worship occasionally in Nonconformist chapels and occasionally in Church, and it was argued that when the question was put to them as to what their religion really was, they would be seized with a kind of mental paralysis and would be quite unable to say what they were. Personally I should have thought there I would have been no more difficulty in stating what your religious convictions were in those circumstances than you would have difficulty in saying by what Christian name you are habitually known supposing you own to two.<lb/>
The last objection of all, and the one upon which no doubt the greatest stress is laid, is that it is feared, as the noble Earl indicated, that persons who had no particular religious belief would inevitably be described as members of the Church I of England. This is a view which I am totally unable to understand. I noticed that the President of the Local Government Board adduced his experiences in prison as a proof of that danger, but all I that he proved was that criminals apparently found a Church of England service more attractive than any others. And with regard to the fear that Agnostics and Freethinkers and people of that description would write themselves down as members of the Church of England, all I can say is that as far as my experience goes such Agnostics as I am acquainted with would never for a moment dream of describing themselves as members of the Church of England, and they would be rather glad of the opportunity of proclaiming what their opinions really were.<lb/>
I maintain that the hypocrisy&#x2014;I can use no other word&#x2014;the gross hypocrisy of these objections is most conclusively proved by the practice in Ireland. The fact that a different system obtains in Ireland is absolutely conclusive to my mind that the objections to a religious census in Great Britain are political and nothing else. The excuse made for treating Ireland differently I understand is this, that religions are so sharply divided in Ireland that there is no difficulty in discrimination and that subsidiary denominations do not exist. I have looked into the figures.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0604"/>
<col>1157</col>
Of course the vast majority of Irishmen are Roman Catholics, but there is a large number, as everybody knows, of Episcopalians; there are Methodists, and there are Presbyterians; in addition, out of a population of 1000,000, there are 60,000 put down as belonging to denominations which are not specified; and out of these 4,000,000 people there were not 700 who made any objection to stating what their religious belief was.<lb/>
Let us be honest if we can over this question. The religious census was established in Ireland in 1861. Why? Because at that time it was proposed to disestablish the Irish Church, and the people who proposed to do so knew that it would be safe to take a religious census. In 1910 you would like to do the same thing in Wales if you had the courage to set about it, but you are not taking a religious census because you are afraid the figures would be against you, and it is desired to encourage the idea that the agitation which is conducted in Parliament and elsewhere is represented by an adequate majority in the country. In no civilised country in the world, so far as I know, with the exception of England and Scotland, is a man, whatever he may be, afraid to avow his religious belief. Here alone, for political reasons, baseless objections are put forward for evading a clear issue, and these baseless objections are admitted by an accommodating Government. All I can say is, it does not reflect much credit either upon the people who make these baseless objections or upon the people who find excuses for them, and I trust that when this Bill goes into Committee some member of this House, a right rev. Prelate for choice, will put down an Amendment embodying the views which I have ventured to express.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02695"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not detain the House for more than a moment, but I rise to express the hope that an Amendment on the lines suggested by the noble Lord will be accepted by His Majesty's Government. The position of Wales presents a strong case for the taking of a religious census. The Prime Minister, in moving his Resolution in the House of Commons regarding the Church in Wales, based his case upon figures, but arrived at the statistical position in a rather curious way. He did not select the number of adherents to the various religious bodies, but counted the
<col>1158</col>
various sittings in Nonconformist place; of worship&#x2014;not a very exhaustive or satisfactory way of dealing with the numerical argument. I do not think there is any great objection to such a census in Wales, Churchmen, at any rate, could most cordially welcome it. For thirty years various religious bodies have organised voluntary religious censuses, but it is impossible to arrive from them at a satisfactory enumeration of the religious beliefs of the people. We are very anxious to know how the statistical argument stands with regard to Wales. If this argument, which I do not think is at all conclusive, is to be used, let it be as accurate as it can be. There has been a Royal Commission sitting on the question of the Church in Wales, and I believe they have been unable to make a satisfactory enumeration from the various statistics that have been supplied. I therefore sincerely hope that an Amendment in the spirit of the remarks of the noble Lord will be moved in Committee and accepted by His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02696"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word or two as to why, in my opinion, We should not treat this suggestion too seriously. This is one of those theatrical parades which we have whenever a Census Bill comes up, but it always comes to nothing, and nobody supposes that the policy which has been settled for many years will be altered this year. I should also like to say a word as to the extremely delusive character of a religious census in England. I have had experience in connection with an obligation to ascertain the religious beliefs of parents. I speak with reference to sending children to industrial schools. In the School Board for London we had a large number of those cases, and the Act of Parliament required that we should ascertain the belief of the parent in order to determine to what school the child should be sent. Year after year we found that when the parent was asked in the police-court what his religious belief was he invariably replied, unless he was a Roman Catholic, that he was a Protestant.<lb/>
The average Englishman, if he is given to religious exercises either in church or chapel, knows what he is, but there is a large number of people whose religion consists largely, like the Royal Declaration, in disclaiming the errors of the Church of Rome. Some noble Lords may remember that a cyclone of religious controversy
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0605"/>
<col>1159</col>
passed through the School Board for London when Mr. Athelstan Riley raised an educational discussion, and, aided by the then Home Secretary, Mr. Matthews, succeeded in getting the magistrates not to be satisfied with the declaration that the parent was a Protestant, but to press upon the parent that he should specify to what denomination of Protestantism he belonged. The majority under this pressure ultimately gravitated to Church of England. That is no doubt what you would get in this case. The ordinary man in the street would very likely call himself Protestant, and if he was goaded to say something further he would say "Church of England," but it would be quite worthless. I do not attach any importance to a census of chapel or church places, because we know that the energy of church builders outruns the zeal of church frequenters. In the United States no official census of religious opinions is taken, though an informal inquiry was set on foot by the various religious bodies themselves. In 1851 there was a religious census taken in this country, but it was a census of the attendance on a particular day in all places of worship. It did not give satisfaction, though so far as it tested preference for any form of religious adhesion it was as good as any.<lb/>
In these theological controversies people make imputations freely. They are the amenities which are associated with theological discussion. For instance, there was the statement of the noble Lord opposite that political Nonconformists in Wales were so anxious to be counted that they wished to count themselves twice over. Since the time to which I have referred various voluntary organisations have attempted this census. The <i>Daily News</i> some years ago took statistics of the number of people attending churches and chapels in London, and similar censuses have been taken in various great towns in Wales, but the results have not been conclusive. If you take important events in men's lives, you are led to believe that there are more adherents to the Church of England than there really are. In the case of marriages, something like between seventy and seventy-five per cent. of the population in this country are married in church. But everyone who knows anything of life, and especially in villages, knows that it is quite the usual thing for people in a village to be married in church,
<col>1160</col>
then to frequent some form of dissenting service throughout their lives, and when they die their right is naturally claimed to a church service, and they are buried in the churchyard. I can assure the noble Lord who has raised this question that of all things the most delusive would be to attempt to get at the religious belief of that floating mass, which is very large, of the population who stand aloof from all forms of religious denomination. More and more the mass of the working-class population are sliding away from adhesion to any form of religious belief, though they are not sliding away from aggressive free thought. The tendencies of the age have brought out a different point of view of these matters. If a census official went round, most of these people, to save bother, would say they belonged to the Church of England, and you would get a most inconclusive conclusion. I hope noble Lords will recognise that, and not clamour for a thing which, even if you got it, would be useless.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02699"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> rose to call attention to the state of the Regular Reserve, the Special Reserve, and the Special Contingent; and to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War&#x2014;

<li>1. If the 27 Fourth Battalion Special Reserve Infantry are considered capable of expanding the Regular Army abroad by battalion units.</li>
<li>2. The establishment of the Special Contingent Category B. in the Army Estimates of 1910 being 7,552 and the strength 552, how is this shortage to be made good for the Expeditionary Force.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02700">The noble Duke said: My Lords, the Prime Minister, speaking last January at Haddington, is reported to have said that&#x2014;
<quote>" He would be perfectly content that the administrative record of the Government should be judged as a test case by comparing the state of the Army as it was left by Lord Midleton and the state of the Army as it is to-day, after four years of Liberal administration."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0606"/>
<col>1161</col>
We know that the Regular Army of to-day is not so numerous as the Regular Army of 1905. If the Government on assuming office considered that the Regular Army, as they then found it, was needlessly large for all the possible demands of Imperial defence, by all means let them reduce its numbers, provided always that there is a corresponding reduction in Army Estimates. The strength of the Army is a matter for the Government of the day, advised by the Committee of Imperial Defence, to decide. It is not a matter which I presume to discuss. I do, however, strongly question the statement made by some members of the Government that by reducing the numbers of the Regular Army they have thereby rendered it a more powerful instrument of war than when they took office. The Under-Secretary of State for War last January went to Bodmin and made a speech, in which he is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>" It is perfectly true we have reduced the Army by something like 18,000 men, but the Army is a stronger thing to-day than before those 18,000 men were taken away."</quote>
Stronger in what? Stronger in numbers or stronger in efficiency?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02701">Let me first take numbers. You have not only reduced the number of men serving with the Colours by 18,000, but, by diminishing nine Reserve-creating <i>cadres</i>, you have reduced the quantity of the Regular Reserve. The high-water mark of the Regular Reserve, the outcome of Lord Midleton's policy, will be reached this year. It is 137,000 men; the low water mark, 106,000, is given in Lord Erroll's Return, and will be readied in 1913. The difference is 31,000 men. The Army Estimates of this year show the actual reduction of men serving with the. Colours to be one short of 24,000. That number, with the ultimate reduction in the Reserve, will amount to 55,000 men gone from the Regular Army and Reserve by 1913. But that is not the end of the story. In 1905, the strength of the Militia&#x2014;that is, the number of men actually present at inspection&#x2014;was 92,035. The Militia has been abolished, and the Special Reserve created. The Special Reserve to-day numbers 67,948 men and 1,823 officers&#x2014;that is. 24,087 men and 625 officers less than the number actually serving and present in the Militia in 1905. We arrive, therefore, at this result, that the Regular Army and the Regular Reserve, <i>plus</i> the Militia, if it had remained
<col>1162</col>
at its strength of 92,035, would have been 79,087 men stronger than the Regular Army with its Regular and Special Reserves will be in 1913. The year 1913 will be an important year in military administration, because that is the date when the reductions initiated by the Government in our First Line will have been fully realised. Of course the Militia was not enlisted for foreign service. But officers and men always served abroad whenever required, and for some years previous to the abolition of the Force were asking for foreign service enlistment. A Bill for that purpose passed its Second Reading in your Lordships' House in March, 1905. There is, therefore, no weight in the argument that whereas the Special Reserve is enlisted for foreign service the Militia Force could not be reckoned upon to serve abroad.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02702">The Army then is weaker in numbers. Is it stronger in efficiency? Any contention that the quality of the Army to-day is vastly superior to that of the Army of 1905 is at once disposed of by the statement of the present Secretary of State for War, who said in March, 1906, three months after he took office&#x2014;
<quote>" Never before that time had there been such good material in the Army. The morale, both of officers and men, was higher than ever it was. The Army was in a condition in which it had never been before, both in point of quantity and quality."</quote>
Now can anyone seriously contend that whilst the quality of an Army remains the same, to reduce its quantity by 80,000 men&#x2014;and I am not talking about a paper establishment but about men who were actually serving in the ranks&#x2014;is to make it stronger for the purposes of war? But I quote from the closing paragraph of the noble Lord's speech at Bodmin&#x2014;
<quote>"Here we are then. The Army is a great deal stronger than when we took office, and it costs the country a great deal less."</quote>
We may well ask whence comes this accession of military power, and do the Army Estimates show a great reduction in expenditure, and one that is likely to be of a permanent character? The Army Estimates for 1905 were &#x00A3;28,000,000; those for 1909, &#x00A3;27,435,000&#x2014;a decrease of &#x00A3;565,000. It is, however, clear from the recent proceedings of many County Associations that unless the Government are prepared to give their new Territorial infant Army, now aged two years, a much more generous scale of diet in the way of pounds, shillings,
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0607"/>
<col>1163</col>
and pence, it will very likely perish in its nursery from insufficient nutrition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02703">I am anxious to draw your Lordships' attention to the condition of the Regular Reserve, then to that of the Special Reserve, and finally to a puzzling lot of people who appear to be interchangeable during various phases of mobilisation between the Territorial Army, the Special Reserve, and the Regular Army. Ever since Lord Cardwell created the Regular Reserve, some forty years ago, the maintenance of its quality and the increase of its quantity have been the constant care of ten successive Secretaries of State for War. In 1906, when the Government assumed office, it was for the first time discovered that the Regular Reserve was unduly inflated and must be diminished. It has been diminished, and, as I have already said, will dwindle away from 137,000 until it touches bottom at 106,000 in 1913. But this year comes a most significant incident&#x2014;namely, that the Secretary of State for War, in introducing the Army Estimates, expressed himself as not satisfied with the future of the Regular Reserve. He considers that there will be no danger for the next two or three years. That is obviously true, because the destructive policy of the Government will not make itself felt till the expiration of that period. It is no more possible to eat your cake and have it than to reduce the Regular Reserve and maintain intact at its original establishment the Expeditionary Force. The formation of this Force at the strength first announced was only possible owing to the presence of the Regular Reserve created by Lord Midleton, inherited by the Government, and now in process of reduction at their hands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02704">In 1907 the Secretary of State for War issued a Memorandum giving a table showing the composition of this Force. If you take that table and the state of the Army in 1908 as a standard of comparison and allow the same rate per cent. for unfitness and immaturity, which is always allowed by the War Office in these calculations, you will find, after a lengthy but simple process of arithmetic, that in 1913, when the Regular Reserve is at its lowest, the deficiency in the Regular Reserve to meet the war establishments required by the Expeditionary Force will be more than 5,000. But inasmuch as the Regular Reserve will be 5,000 men short of the number
<col>1164</col>
required, it will be necessary to dip at once, and pretty deeply, into the Special Reserve. I lay stress on this point for this reason. It is expressly stated in the last Army Annual Return that the Special Reserve will not be used for active service at once, but will, on mobilisation, commence to acquire that training without which I have never heard it suggested that the men are' fit to take the field as first line soldiers. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War told us on the 18th of May of last year, when speaking of the mobilisation of the battalions upon the peace establishment&#x2014;
<quote>"You may have a few hundred or a few thousand men over, but practically speaking whatever is left over is a negligible quantity."</quote>
The noble Lord is describing with great accuracy the result in 1913 of the Government policy of reducing the Regular Reserve. At present, owing to the large Reserve created by Lord Midleton, there would be a surplus of Regular Reservists left behind after the departure of the Expeditionary Force of more than 20,000 men, and that after allowing for all necessary deductions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02705">There are two great Army problems demanding simultaneous solution. They are the maintenance of a large Army Reserve and the supply of the Indian drafts. The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, created the largest Army Reserve we have ever had by the plan of three years Colour service, but that period of enlistment did not suit for the provision of the Indian drafts, and hence it had to be abandoned. Mr. Arnold-Forster endeavoured to meet the double problem of the Regular Reserve and of the Indian drafts by creating concurrent long and short service enlistment. The present Government on assuming office hastened to wipe out that plan without even giving it a trial. In short, they reverted to the same system which had been proved by experience to furnish an insufficient Reserve in time of war, although it did meet the difficulty of the Indian drafts in time of peace. Then after four years they warn us that the problem of the Regular Reserve is unsolved and that its future is critical. The administrative record of the Government, as regards the Regular Reserve, is that having succeeded to the most numerous Regular Reserve we have ever had, they will in six years time reduce it to such an attenuated condition that, in
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0608"/>
<col>1165</col>
their own opinion, it will give cause for anxiety. Are we expected to accept that result as a proof of superior success in Army administration?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02706">I now come to the Special Reserve. In November, 1908&#x2014;that is, in the first year of the existence of this Force&#x2014;the Secretary of State for War, speaking at Guildford, is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"So far from the Regular Army having been cut down, we are to-day 90,000 stronger."</quote>
That number of 90,000 represented the total establishment of all branches of the Special Reserve when the formation of the new Force was first announced, and it corresponded approximately with the actual number of men present in the ranks of the Militia previous to its abolition. In dealing with the Army Estimates this year the Secretary of State for War informs us that the establishment of the Special Reserve will in future be 70,000. This means that a strength of 90,000 men who were actually present and serving in the ranks of the Militia will be reduced to a paper establishment of 70,000 Special Reservists, and that there is no Militia Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02707">The Special Reserve comprises Infantry, Artillery, Engineers, Army Service Corps, Army Medical Corps and Veterinary Corps. To get at the true state of this Force it is necessary to deal with it in detail, and I cannot now go beyond the Infantry. The Special Reserve Infantry have seventy-four third battalions and twenty-seven fourth battalions. The establishment for subalterns is 1,915. By the Return on the Table of the House, and including twenty-four subalterns lately passed into the Regular Army, the deficiency is 1,381. You have 534 subalterns serving instead of 1,915 required. The number of Regular officers required for all the Special Reserve battalions is said by the Return to be complete, but by the Army List of the 1st of May fifty-six captains and fifty-three Regular subalterns have not yet been posted to the third and fourth battalions. Perhaps the noble Lord the Under-Secretary could say if the Return is right and the Army List wrong, or the other way about. The discrepancy of 109 Regular officers in the Infantry alone is considerable. On March 1st. 1909, the Secretary of State for War was asked if he was satisfied with the recruiting of the Special Reserve officers. The right hon. gentle-
<col>1166</col>
man replied that he depended on the new Officers Training Corps, the fruits of which would begin to be seen in the summer of 1909. We are now in the summer of 1910. On the 7th of March of the present year the right hon. gentleman stated that fifty officers from the Officers Training Corps had joined all branches of the Special Reserve, and that he was still hopeful of getting 1,000 per annum from this source. But the Return now on the Table of the House shows that since its formation the Officers Training Corps has supplied the Special Reserve Infantry with three officers. A deficiency of 1,380 subalterns met by an average intake of about one and a-half officers per year as far as the Officers Training Corps is concerned! As regards men, the Special Reserve Infantry shows an increase of 522 since last year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02708">The duties of the third and fourth battalions of the Special Reserve are different in time of war. The fourth battalions, we have always been told, are ready and are reckoned upon to expand the Regular Army abroad by battalion units the same as the Militia used to do. As regards officers, the establishment of subalterns for these twenty-seven extra special Reserve battalions is 513; the number now serving is 120&#x2014;a deficiency of 393. Not a single battalion is less than ten officers deficient, and one of these fourth battalions is twenty officers deficient out of an establishment of twenty-eight. If the total number of boys under twenty years of age is deducted, as they must be, for foreign service, and ten per cent. of the remainder is allowed as medically unfit, the strongest of these battalions would number 470 for foreign service, and the weakest 120. The twenty-seven battalions would average 370 men for foreign service, but they are very uneven in strength, and it must be remembered that the ten per cent. allowed for unfitness is the rate for the Regular Army and is sure to be exceeded in the case of the Special Reserve, for the best of all possible reasons&#x2014;namely, that the Force is recruited in the first instance from men unfit for the Regular Army in time of peace, and that the boys in the Special Reserve do not, like the Line recruits, grow all the year round under the eye of the Army surgeon amidst most sanitary surroundings, but at the end of six months are discharged into the streets to shift for themselves. I have made no allowance for absence due to desertion, death, emigration, and frau-
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0609"/>
<col>1167</col>
dulent enlistment by the same man into several regiments, so that the figure of 370 is really an impossible maximum. These battalions have, of course, no Reserve to draw upon. I ask the Under-Secretary of State for War if the Government consider these battalions will be available for the expansion of the Army overseas by battalion units. It is idle to talk about increasing or rather doubling the establishment of these battalions, except you are prepared to show us how you are going to obtain the officers and men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02709">I now pass to the seventy-four third battalions who form the general drafting pool. In order to understand how this plan would work out, I must ask your Lordships to assume two things&#x2014;first, that the year 1913 has come, and, secondly, that the Expeditionary Force has gone abroad. Then calculations based on Army Returns show that, taking the Army of 1908 as a standard of comparison, we should be left at home with seven Regular battalions, but depleted battalions, because of the many calls made upon them to help the Expeditionary Force. Then a mass of some 77,000 men and boys, composed of the unsound from the Regular Reserve and the immature and unfit from the Line and Special Reserve. This collection of 77,000 men and boys, all either too young or unfit for active service, are to bring the ranks of all the seventy-four third Special Reserve battalions up to a thousand men or more per battalion. We are told that these Reserve battalions thus swollen are to move into the vacated barracks and port defences, a move which will, by the way, denude the regimental depots of all their trained mobilisation staff at the very moment when their services are most required.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02710">These third battalions, we have been told by the Secretary of State for War this year, are to serve three purposes&#x2014;training drafts for the Army overseas, defending ports, and flocking to strengthen the central field force when crushing raids. How they are to defend a port and join a central field force at the same time is one of those secrets of mobilisation which we are not allowed to know. Let us consider their fitness for the discharge of this treble duty. I have mentioned the deficiency of subalterns. Then as to that vital third estate, the non-commissioned officers. A Line battalion would take into the field 880
<col>1168</col>
trained men in the ranks, with a staff of seventy-four non-commissioned officers. For the Special Reserve battalion a staff of thirty-two non-commissioned officers is allowed to manage 1,000 or more men and boys collected from different sources, and devoid of all regimental spirit and feeling, and with but little discipline. Battalions so composed and without any adequate supply of officers and non-commissioned officers are not battalions at all. They are crowds, incapable of performing any military duty requiring a battalion organisation. It is true that these seventy-four depots, for they are in no sense battalions, can send out drafts of men. The surgeons may patch up a proportion of the unsound men from the Regular Reserve and Line and make them temporarily fit to be sent abroad on active service, but not even the Army Council can turn Special Reserve boys of seventeen and eighteen into mature soldiers of twenty-two or twenty-three years of age in six months, or yet a couple of years. But who is going to take charge of these drafts when they go abroad, for there are no non-commissioned officers, there are no subaltern officers, and the First Line drafts must begin to leave the moment the Expeditionary Force takes the field?</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02711">We have been told in an Army Memorandum dated February 25, 1907, that to supply the waste of war during the first six months 3,500 officers will be required, and 75,000 men. The 75,000 men will be there, but not available for service overseas, because they are composed, as the War Office statistics tell us, of the discarded elements of the Expeditionary Force. Then as to the 3,500 officers. The only suggested source of supply is the Officers Training Corps, which up to the date of the Return furnished three officers to the Special Reserve Infantry since its formation by the Army Order dated March 8, 1908. It is all very well to talk of an Officers Training Corps of 20,000 members, but these are cadets in school corps. I hope they may all grow up, but will they ever be able to discharge the duties of a First Line officer on active service within a few weeks of the outbreak of war? There is, I know, at present a large paper reserve of officers, composed chiefly of ex-Militia and ex-Volunteer officers, who were once occasional soldiers, but retired some years ago when the great changes took place, since which time they have
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0610"/>
<col>1169</col>
done no military training at all, but have outgrown a subaltern's age.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02712">I now come to that category of men who appear to belong to all three branches of our military forces simultaneously. They are called the, Special Contingent. They originate in the Territorial Army to which they are supernumerary, but it is in theory only, because, so long as the Force is below its establishment, how can there be supernumeraries save in imagination? On mobilisation these men are to leave the Territorial Force, filter through the Special Reserve into the Regular Reserve, and ultimately be deposited in the Regular Army. They consist of Engineers, Army Service Corps, and Army Medical Corps. The establishment is 7,552, and their strength, according to Army Estimates of this year, is 552, leaving a deficit of 7,000 men. The Special Contingent is necessary to complete the Expeditionary Force, and I beg to ask how its absence, which is fairly complete, will be made good. The Regular Reserve is in process of rapid reduction, and in less than three years time it will not be able to meet the requirements of the Expeditionary Force. In its place we have the new drafting pool, filled by the Special Reserve, the Special Contingent, and officers and men in the Territorial Force who accept the metal badge for foreign service. As a result we are informed that now for the very first time arrangements have been made for the scientific provision of First Line drafts to the Army in the field. As regards the Special Contingent, with an establishment of 7,552 it shows a deficit of 7,000. It is non-existent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02713">I have described in detail the state of the Special Reserve Infantry. I now beg to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War if he will kindly explain how he proposes to remedy the lack of officers, the lack of non-commissioned officers, and the lack of mature and sound men in the First Line Reserve. For my own part I cannot accept, as a scientific provision for drafts for the Regular Army, officers who have been at some time or other, and that some four or five years, ago, in the old Volunteer or Militia forces, or boy officers, that is to say cadets straight from school or college; Regular non-commissioned officers made by the simple process of sewing stripes on to the sleeves of non-Regular private soldiers; and, finally, unfit Reservists and unfit men from the Line and boys from the Special
<col>1170</col>
Reserve who must now go abroad without having done any Colour service at all. If all the officers required for the Special Reserve Infantry and for the Regular Mounted Infantry, which are detailed to act as divisional Cavalry with the Expeditionary Force, are sent to those forces from the line on mobilisation, there would be now, by the Army List, a shortage of 700 officers in the Line. There must be 700 vacancies on mobilisation for officers either in the Line or in the Special Reserve, because in spite of War Office legerdemain one pea cannot be under two thimbles. I beg to ask the Questions standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02714"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke is an extremely difficult debater to follow and extremely difficult to answer. He has an unparalleled knowledge of details and an unparalleled power of presenting them, but in taking part in a debate inaugurated by the noble Duke I always feel that we are in some danger of not seeing the wood for the trees. After all, we must consider this question not only from the point of view of details, but also from the general standpoint. The only criterion by which you can judge any military system is what are going to be the results of the changes which we know the noble Duke so greatly deplores. I am glad to be in a position to say that we are now within measureable distance of achieving the main object that we set before ourselves when we embarked upon this reorganisation scheme&#x2014;namely, being able to mobilise six Divisions of Regulars with all their auxiliary services, with lines of communication, and the Cavalry Division. We can already mobilise more than four Divisions, with lines of communication and the Cavalry Division, and on a pinch I think we can mobilise the rest. We should not in these circumstances have the whole of the draft-finding machinery behind complete, because we should have to draw on that at the present moment to an undue degree, and to a degree which we shall not have to draw upon it when the organisation fills up. At the present moment we can mobilise a larger expeditionary force than has ever been possible before in the history of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02715"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02716"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: And that force is a real force and composed of efficient soldiers.
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0611"/>
<col>1171</col>
Therefore we are in process of carrying out the object which we set before ourselves at the beginning of this reorganisation. After all, you have to consider the various parts to which the noble Duke referred from the standpoint of how far they are fitted to be components in the general scheme. I will take them in the order in which the noble Duke dealt with them. But I would like to say that the value of the many speeches of the noble Duke, to which we always listen with interest, is to a great extent, if he will allow me to say so, spoilt by the fact that there are four principal fallacies underlying all his arguments. The noble Duke, first of all, argues that we are replacing Regular Reservists by Special Reservists. The noble Duke assents. We are doing nothing of the kind. There are two entirely separate questions involved. One is the reduction of certain units of the Regular Army. You may agree with that policy or you may not, but that has absolutely nothing to do with the question of mobilising the units that remain with their own Reservists. You have to treat those two questions entirely separately. We are perfectly prepared to justify, though I do not think we need enter now into that question, the reductions which are made in the Infantry. But there is one thing which comes out perfectly clearly and plain with regard to the Reserve, and it is this, that under the Cardwell system, or any other system, you cannot have any method or terms of service which will at the same time enable you to maintain your drafts for India and do more than fill up the home battalions to their fighting strength on mobilisation. It has been tried in every form. Various terms have been tried. Three years with the Colours and nine years with the Reserve has been tried, but that will not produce the drafts for India. Then six years with the Colours and six with the Reserve, and nine years with the Colours and three with the Reserve have been tried. Whichever you adopt you find that if you provide your drafts for India you cannot do more than bring your units up to fighting strength on mobilisation with Reservists that remain. You may have a few hundreds over, but, broadly speaking, that is all you are able to do under the Cardwell system. Therefore we did the only thing possible. We are maintaining the Reserve while at the same time finding the necessary drafts for India, and we shall be able to
<col>1172</col>
mobilise our fighting units when the time comes.<lb/>
Then the noble Duke argued as if all Special Reserve recruits were only seventeen years of age, and he always argues as if they will continue to remain unfit for the Regulars. He also assumes that the Special Reserve is simply to be an expensive funnel by which men pass into the Regulars. How those two things can come about at one and the same time I do not understand. If a man is fit to pass into the Regulars from the Special Reserve, presumably you cannot consider him in every case unfit to join the Regulars in the form of drafts. There is another important assumption the noble Duke makes. He bases his arguments on the point of all Special Reservists being required for the purposes of drafts at once on mobilisation. That cannot be the case. How soon they will be required it is impossible to say. It must depend upon the nature of the war, but we should require none of the Infantry Special Reservists at first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02717"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Is the noble Lord speaking of the present state of things, or what my noble friend behind me called the moment when the Regular Reserve will be at its lowest&#x2014;in 1913? On an outbreak of war in 1913 does the noble Lord say that no Special Reservist will be required at once to fill up the fighting line?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02718"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I will take the year 1913, when the Regular Reserve will be at its lowest. In that case we shall require no Special Reservists to bring the Regular battalions up to full war establishment; we shall only require them subsequently for drafts and in a successive series of drafts, so that there will be time for these men to mature. To take the Special Reserve and to say that because at a given time there is a certain proportion of immature men, therefore that proportion will remain for the purpose for which we shall require these third battalions, is incorrect. The fourth point that always underlies the noble Duke's speeches is that for these purposes the Special Reserve is in every sense inferior to the old Militia. I would point out, as the noble Duke raised that question, that the Militia, though it is quite true they were prepared to volunteer for service abroad, were not
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0612"/>
<col>1173</col>
prepared to volunteer for service abroad in the form which, from the general standpoint of military organisation, is incomparably the more useful&#x2014;namely, to go abroad in drafts. They were prepared to go abroad only as units, and I say without hesitation that the value of men who will go abroad as drafts is double that of those who are only prepared to go abroad as units. The Special Reserve is by no means unique in having a considerable number of immature men, and there is nothing that can be said about them in that respect that was not equally applicable to the old Militia.<lb/>
The noble Duke challenges the power of the Special Reserve to carry out its functions. I would like to place before your Lordships what the position of the Special Reserve is and its general fitness, and how the scheme is working in the light of our last year's experience. About this time last year I was able to tell your Lordships that the reports already received on the Special Reserve were satisfactory. I am glad to be able to say that the reports received this year show that the improvement has been more than sustained. Our military authorities in the districts tell us that the Special Reserve is more popular than it was; it is drawing a very good class of men; and the physique is very good. Those of your Lordships who may have read the annual General Return will have observed that we have been able to raise the height standard to 5ft. 3in., which was until quite recently the height limit for the Line, although it has now gone up to 5ft. 4in. for the first time for twenty years. In those ways there is a marked superiority in our reports on the part of the Special Reserve over the old Militia, although it is quite true that the men as a whole are younger&#x2014;that is to say, there is a smaller number of men over twenty years of age coming in as recruits. In the matter of age, however, there is very little to choose between them. Last October there were 19,855 men under twenty out of a total of 67,548, which is just about the same average as with the Militia. In fact, I think that is an average which the force will probably always maintain. You cannot judge at the present moment of the number of men you will have mature and fit to send abroad in the early stages of a war, especially if you have to send them to some country where the climate is tropical and unhealthy.<lb/>
<col>1174</col>
I know it is argued by the noble Duke that we have so many men over twenty in the Special Reserve at the present moment because of the old Militiamen, and that when those men go the state of things will be greatly altered. Out of 12,000 men who were dismissed to their homes on the completion of their six months training, on the analogy of last year's figures approximately 1,000 would have tried to pass into the Regular Army. That leaves you something like 11,000 men who have not tried to go straight into the Regular Army but have remained in the Special Reserve. The Militia in old days and the Special Reserve now consist of two classes of men&#x2014;those who join in order to pass into the Regular Army and those who wish to remain. I have described these men who remain as a sediment, for in every year's intake there is a certain number who pass into the Regular Army and a certain number who remain. The latter will remain for six years instead of four years as in the old Militia, so that until the system has been running for six years you will not be able to tell what your normal proportion of mature men in the Special Reserve is going to be. There is a very fair proportion, about the same as in the old Militia, of men who join with the intention of staying on. I cannot say more on that point, because we have not had time to judge, but, so far as we can judge at present, the Special Reserve is coming out of the test very well indeed.<lb/>
With regard to the general question of the efficiency of the Special Reserve, I am glad to say that our reports are particularly good. The results of the six months recruit training are excellent. We have had reports from the officers responsible for the training, in which they say that the system is working exceedingly well. We have lately received an exceptionally good report from the General Officer commanding at Salisbury as to the Special Reserve battalions who have been training on the Plain, and from the point of view of general military efficiency they are considerably superior to the old Militia. We are perfectly satisfied that these are the kind of men who will perform satisfactorily the work we intend them to do, which is to act as drafts for the Regulars. In the matter of musketry the returns are also good. It is quite true that there is less time for musketry, and perhaps the annual course of musketry is less thorough
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0613"/>
<col>1175</col>
than it was, but the recruit has a much better grounding than formerly in his six months recruit training, and he does not therefore require so long for his annual course.<lb/>
Complaints have been made as to the training of the non-commissioned officers. With a shortened training that is a difficulty, but this year we are instituting a course by which non-commissioned officers come up a month before their battalions come up. It is purely voluntary on their part, but they can, if they like, go through a month's extra training. There is another point which I daresay will interest your Lordships with regard to this. This year we are going to experiment with the Special Reserve and to impose a very high test on the Force in performing in peace time the functions for which it is intended in war. We are going to use a certain number of these Special Reservists to bring the Second Division up to something like war strength in this year's manoeuvres, and in some cases between 300 and 400 men of the Special Reserve will be incorporated for the time being in Line battalions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02719"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Officers as well as men?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02720"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes. It will be a very high test on these Special Reservists, because they will only have had about eleven days training before the manoeuvres, whereas, as your Lordships know, the manoeuvres come in the Regular Army as a climax to a long period of very strenuous training. The men are in extraordinarily good condition and fit to inarch, with great powers of endurance; therefore to put your comparatively untrained Special Reservist alongside of them is going to be a good test indeed. Then with regard to the twenty-seven extra battalions to which the noble Duke referred. When passing the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act we listened to the blandishments of noble Lords on the opposite side of the House and departed from our original intention, which was that the establishment of the fourth battalions should be considerably higher than the establishment of the third battalions. In deference to the wishes expressed in this House and in the other House by the Opposition, we agreed to bring down the establishment of the fourth battalions to that of the third, and we realise now that that was a mistake. I think there is perfect truth in the noble

Duke's criticism that as they stand at the present moment they are not strong enough to go out as combatant units. An able Departmental Committee has for some time been considering the subject, and I can assure your Lordships that it is undergoing the most careful attention, as we realise that something will have to be done to make the battalions stronger than they are at the present time.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the officers for the Special Reserve. We know that there is a great shortness of officers, and this is one of our most difficult problems. We started the Officers Training Corps, and we believe that we have found a solution for this. I am glad to say that we are now beginning to see the results of the system. Since the Return referred to by the noble Duke was issued, fifty officers from the Officers Training Corps have obtained commissions in the Special Reserve, and something like 120 in the Territorial Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02721"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: In the Special Reserve Infantry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02722"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: In all arms, but most of them are in the Infantry. I am glad to say that we are receiving now a considerable number of inquiries from members of the Officers Training Corps with regard to commissions, so that the harvest is now commencing, and I think we are going to get a considerable number of officers. There is a further difficulty with regard to this. The class of officer who is able to go out at the particular time of year when his unit trains is limited, and I am not at all sure that we are not getting somewhere towards the end of that class. Some men, especially young men, in business do not control their own time, and have to take their holidays when they can get them. Such men, however keen they may be to do soldiering, may find it difficult to join a unit which trains at a particular time. To that class of men the Supplementary List, as we call it, is a greater attraction than joining a unit of the Special Reserve. When a man becomes an officer in the Supplementary List, he can go out for training at whatever time of the year suits him best, and he does his training with a Regular unit. There is no doubt, from inquiries we are receiving, that if we can extend the system of the Supplementary List we shall secure a considerable number
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0614"/>
<col>1177</col>
of officers who would not otherwise be obtained.<lb/>
As to the noble Duke's last question, it is quite true that the men in what we call Category B are not yet up to anything like establishment. They are men who for the purpose of training are attached to the Territorial Force; they are borne supernumerary to their units. Since the figures which the noble Duke quotes were issued they have considerably increased, and are now well over 800, but there still remains a considerable gap. We are adopting a temporary measure while they are filling up. Medicals form a considerable number of these Category B men. We have had satisfactory results from taking advantage of the big Reserve that exists at the present moment and training a certain number of Infantrymen. We have nearly 2,000 Infantrymen who have gone through a special course of training in medical duties, and who have undertaken the obligation to come out on mobilisation as members of the Royal Army Medical Corps. We are going to extend that this winter to a certain extent, so that that will partly fill up the gap. The remaining men who will be required are chiefly Army Service Corps drivers, but every day the need for these is diminishing as mechanical transport is becoming more and more the accepted thing.<lb/>
I have tried to cover the ground as fully as I possibly can. I must say that we have every reason to be satisfied with the way in which the scheme is progressing. We are getting a good class of men, we are getting them in good numbers, and their training is satisfactory. We have now before us at least the prospect of obtaining an entirely new supply of officers, and our system in that way is, it seems to me, working well. I hope I have given the noble Duke the information he requires, and I trust he will see that we, at any rate, do not share any of the gloomy forebodings as to the future of any of the forces which were mentioned by the noble Duke.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02723"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I shall not be considered disrespectful if I say that the interesting speech which the noble Lord has just delivered is not entirely convincing to us on this side of the House as regards the position of the Force with which he specially dealt. The noble Lord, while not admitting the noble
<col>1178</col>
Duke's conclusions, does not challenge his well-certificated figures, and he leaves us with the optimistic conclusions of the War Office but with the facts of the noble Duke unchallenged and unrefuted. I did not intend to take part in this debate in view of the series of military discussions which are to come on in your Lordships' House, but I really cannot allow the noble Lord or the House to go away with the impression that we accept the conclusions at which the War Office have arrived in this matter.<lb/>
This and other Motions on the Paper are not the result of a desire to be continually harping upon the deficiencies of the Army, but they are the result of the provocative and highly-exaggerated accounts which the Secretary of State for War has given of our position time after time. The noble Duke quoted a speech which I consider to have been almost a criminal speech for a man in the position of the Secretary of State for War to have made. In that speech, which was delivered nearly a year and a-half ago at Guildford, the right hon. gentleman told the country that for purposes of offence abroad we were stronger by 90,000 men than we had been before the Government came into office.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02727"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I absolutely challenge it. I say there is not a particle or shred of foundation for that statement. The figures quoted by the noble Duke refute it. The noble Duke has stated that the Government are now 18,000 men short with the Colours of the number they inherited; in the Army Reserve they will be 36,000 short, and in the Special Reserve 24,000 short of the old Militia&#x2014;making 79,000 men short. All you have to put against that is that you have 57,000 men, I think the number is, in the Special Reserve who before were not obliged to go abroad, but who did, in point of fact, go abroad when they were called upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02728"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I submit that that does not disprove my right hon. friend's statement last year, that we had at that time 90,000 more men available for service abroad than we had when he took office.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0005P0-02731"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I challenge that figure. The Secretary of State did exactly what the noble Lord has done to-night. The noble Lord told us, I think with great inaccuracy, that the Government were able to send a larger number of troops abroad now than ever before. I say that we were able in 1905 to send as large a number of men abroad as he is now able to send in 1910.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02732"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Not in anything approaching the proper proportion of the different arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0005P0-02733"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: What the noble Lord is fond of doing is this, and he has inherited it from the Secretary of State for War. He takes the exact position of the moment in a scheme not fully developed and says, Look how much better we can do than that. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne added between sixty and seventy batteries of Artillery to the Army, and because, as would be the case under any system in any country in Europe, those batteries were not able within three years to produce the whole Reserve element which they would ultimately have produced, the noble Lord proceeds to say that the scheme inherited by the present Government would not have enabled the Artillery to have been mobilised, and then, having cut down the Artillery, he proceeds to say they never would have been mobilised. That is one way of bringing out the figures. With regard to the other position, when the Secretary of State for War was speaking of his 90,000 men he was drawing upon the Reserve of Infantry, 36,000 of whom are going to disappear in the next four years. He counted those in among his 90,000, although he has destroyed the <i>cadre</i> which produced them and done away with the period of service by which they might have been continued.<lb/>
I could not allow these exaggerated statements to go unchallenged. I know them to be inaccurate. I know that they are founded on false premises, and that they have led the country to false conclusions. Seeing that the present state of things has been brought about by an
<col>1180</col>
enormous reduction in the number of men and that without the corresponding reduction in expenditure which had been promised, I am afraid that in a subsequent debate it will be necessary for your Lordships to consider this from the point of view of the Territorial Army and the general strength of the country. The whole of this subject of the Special Reserve is argued by the noble Lord as if it was only a question of getting a certain number of men to shovel into the Regular battalions now bereft of the Reserve which was created for them before, and to fill up the gaps which the abolition of those <i>cadres</i> which produced the Reserves has left. I would point out that there was a clear understanding, in the debates of 1907, that the <i>cadres</i> of the Special Reserve should themselves be able to mobilise. They were not to be bereft of all their men and were to be sent out with their officers. I want your Lordships to follow what has occurred in this discussion. The noble Duke pointed out that there are 500 officers short in certain battalions. The noble Lord, in reply, says, very ingeniously, that they are training officers who are not being trained with the battalions but will go up at other times of the year. How are those officers to take men whom they have never seen and with whom they have never trained out to join in a campaign, say, in India? You are not keeping to your bargain that you would maintain the <i>cadres</i> intact, and that any men you did take out as drafts you would take out under their own officers.<lb/>
As between the two I believe your Lordships will feel that the noble Duke has made good his case when he said that what would remain behind in these <i>cadres</i> would not be of any great military value. Remember that after these six Divisions have gone&#x2014;and you can only mobilise four now&#x2014;you have nothing remaining behind against an invader except these <i>cadres</i> of Special Reserve battalions and the. Territorial Army, the value of the former of which the noble Duke has said so much about this afternoon. I do feel that on these points we have a right to complain of the exaggerated language which has been used by the representative of the War Office, not for the first time. As we are not in possession of the reports which are always cited to us showing a more admirable state of things than we on this side of the House are aware of&#x2014;although it
<image src="S5LV0005P0I0616"/>
<col>1181</col>
might not be in the power of the noble Lord, having regard to the public interest, to publish all these reports upon which he founds his roseate descriptions of the condition of the Army&#x2014;it is inevitable that there should be a feeling of incredulity with respect to them when the figures which are quoted can be shown to be inaccurate; and I am afraid that in consequence I must charge at the noble Lord's door the multiplication of Army debates, which I for one, in the public interest, should be very glad to forego.</membercontribution></p>
