<p id="S5LV0004P0-00090">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00091"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this very small Bill. It is indeed a very modest and unpretentious measure, and had I not seen the notice of opposition on the part of the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees, I should have thought that it was impossible to find anything to object to in it. It is simply to enable local authorities in Ireland to strike a rate and to spend a very small sum of the ratepayers' money in advertising in other parts than in Ireland the advantages and the amenities of their health resorts and watering-places. I do not think I can do better than read a few lines from a memorandum that has been drawn up, and, I think, sent to your
<col>2</col>
Lordships regarding the objects of this Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"The desire to encourage visitors to Ireland is strongly felt by all classes in that country, but the difficulties in the way of making known the beauties and attractions of various districts there among the British public are very great owing to the great competition with Switzerland and other countries where the development of tourist business has been a national question, and where large sums are expended by the public authorities in those countries in advertising for and attracting the British tourist. This is a question in which not only the local authorities are interested, but also the railways and carrying companies who have expended, during recent years, enormous sums in the improvement of transport and intercommunication between England and Ireland &#x2026; The towns in Ireland most anxious for the Bill are Cork, Queenstown, Killarney, Kingstown, Bray, Killaloe and a number of towns in the North of Ireland. In all of these towns the local authorities have, under the authority of the Local Gov&#x00E9;rnment Board, borrowed money and expended large sums in improvements suitable and necessary for the accommodation of visitors, and they naturally feel that unless there are powers granted to enable them to bring these advantages before the travelling public they do not receive the full benefit which they might otherwise expect from the large expenditures they have incurred. The sums likely to be expended in advertising are very trifling compared with the interest and sinking fund which has to be repaid in connection with these expenditures.</quote>
Therefore so far as this is a Bill to protect Ireland against foreign competition it is almost of the nature of a modified Tariff Reform Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0008"/>
<col>3</col>
I do not know whether your Lordships noticed the names on the back of the Bill. They comprised three Unionist Ulster Members:&#x2014;Mr. H. T. Barrie, Mr. T. L. Corbett, and Captain Craig; one Liberal Member representing an Irish Constituency, Mr. Glendinning; and seven Nationalist Members. All the Conservative members representing Ireland are in favour of this Bill. It is likewise backed and supported by the whole of the Nationalist members. Ireland is unanimous, so far as its members in the House of Commons are concerned, in support of this Bill. The Government starred it and therefore made it an official measure in order to enable the House of Commons to pass it, and it was assented to by Sir Alexander Acland-Hood, the chief Unionist Whip, on behalf of the Front Opposition Bench. Therefore I venture to claim for it that it comes here with the unanimous support of the House of Commons. It is true that one member in the other House raised some objection, not to the Bill as a Bill but to the Bill as a Government measure, because he said, being a Unionist, that no Government measure ought to be allowed to pass. That was Mr. Claude Hay, and he was requested by the ex-Solicitor-General for Ireland, Mr. Campbell, to withdraw his opposition in this phrase&#x2014;
<quote>"He hoped that Mr. Claude Hay would not prevent Ireland from getting what all Ireland wanted."</quote>
I understand that the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees is going to move that the Bill be read a second time this day three months. I am not clear on what grounds he bases his opposition, but I think I am entitled to anticipate the noble Earl's arguments.<lb/>
I believe it is urged that, in the first place, health resorts and watering-places either in Ireland or elsewhere ought not to advertise the merits of their wares, as it were, because unhealthy rivalry and competition might spring up and the ratepayers' money be expended unwisely. But I think I ought to point out to your Lordships that this Bill lays it down that the maximum rate that may be imposed in this direction is a penny in the pound; and I am sure your Lordships will recognise that in a poor country like Ireland, where the rateable value of these health resorts is not very great, a penny in the pound will bring in no very large sum of money.
<col>4</col>
Irishmen are as wise in the administration of their financial matters as we are, and I am sure that the local authorities will not unwisely or with any insane degree of recklessness expend the money of the ratepayers. But how are they to make known outside the advantages of their own districts unless they are allowed to advertise?<lb/>
The second argument which I believe the noble Earl is going to advance is that if this power is granted to Ireland it cannot logically be withheld in this country when any towns come to Parliament and ask for similar powers. I venture to suggest that the noble Earl is entirely wrong, and I think against his contention one might cite almost the whole Statute Book of the realm. The great bulk of Bills before your Lordships' House and of Acts of Parliament that are passed do not deal in similar fashion with England and with Ireland. How many Bills have your Lordships had experience of dealing with Ireland alone; and it is a very frequent matter to find at the end of a Bill this significant clause, "This Bill shall not extend to Ireland." As a matter of fact, one might argue that it is the exception and not the rule when Bills, embodying principles perhaps far more important and more far-reaching than this, do apply both to England and Ireland. Therefore it is impossible to argue that because this very limited power is given to a very poor country which cannot possibly make the merits of its health resorts and watering-places known otherwise than by advertisement, this principle is bound to be embodied in other Bills to which your Lordships' assent will be asked dealing with towns in this country.<lb/>
I venture to suggest that the principle should be dealt with as far as Ireland is concerned at the present time, and that when other Bills, of which I do not for one moment fear the introduction, are introduced for England, that will be the time for the noble Earl to object. To use the phrase of an Irishman, there is not one whisper of opposition from any corner of Ireland to this Bill, and I do not think any Irish Peer will get up and oppose it. I venture to suggest that the noble Earl does not know better what Ireland wants than the Irish members of Parliament, and, therefore, I hope he will
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0009"/>
<col>5</col>
waive his decision and allow the Bill to be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00092">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Marchamley.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00093"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member>, who had given notice, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move that the Bill be read 2<sup>a</sup> this day three months, said: My Lords, the noble Earl said he was surprised to find that a notice of opposition had been put down to so harmless a Bill, but I think he will agree with me that the best thing I could do if I intended to ask your Lordships to take any exception to this Bill was to give due notice thereof, not only to the noble Lord but also to all members of your Lordships' House, and the result of my doing so has been to give an opportunity to those who support the Bill to take all the steps in their power to ask members of your Lordships' House to give it your support. The noble Lord appealed to some extent to the sentiment of your Lordships. He said that Ireland is a poor country, and surely you might allow it to have this little Bill. We all know that Ireland is the spoilt child of Parliament. Ireland has Acts of Parliament which make the mouths of Englishmen and Scotsmen water when we see the advantages that are extended to that country but which are denied to us. But what I desire to do is to call your Lordships' attention to what this must inevitably lead.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00094">There is nothing really new in the proposal. It is one which is made every year in one or more of the Private Bills that come before your Lordships' House, and it has been the universal practice both of this House and of the other House to refuse clauses which provide that the ratepayers' money shall be spent in advertising the attractions of any particular locality. There are measures on the Statute Book which allow of advertising, but in every case except one&#x2014;that of Blackpool, where it was allowed by inadvertence&#x2014;the money is derived from some undertaking which shows a profit and the expenditure is confined to the profits derived from that undertaking. It is confined, in the case of Brighton, to profits from the Aquarium; in the case of Buxton, to profits from the Pump Room; and so on. What would be the result if you allowed all these places to compete
<col>6</col>
with each other in advertising their attractions? There is nothing that I know of to equal provincial jealousy. One small place is more jealous of its neighbour than it is of all the rest of the world. I remember it was one of the greatest difficulties we had to contend with in Australia. There was a Governor of New South Wales who went over to Melbourne and ventured, in an after-dinner speech, to say that Melbourne was the largest town in Australia, which was a truism and the merest commonplace. But he was so hauled over the coals when he got back to Sydney that he made the excuse that the statement was made after dinner and that the champagne was exceptionally good.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00095">Do you not think the same thing will happen in Ireland? We shall have the inhabitants of Killaloe advertising that magnificent outside cars are provided to take people to see the beauties of the Valley of the Shannon, and then we shall have Killarney advertising to the effect that there are no old-fashioned outside cars there and nothing but up-to-date automobiles. I cannot help thinking that if you allow this to take place, the same thing must be allowed to Margate, Eastbourne, and to all the health resorts in England. Your Lordships are probably aware that there is now a large amount of advertising of English health resorts. But how is it done? It is done by voluntary association of those interested&#x2014;of the railway companies, lodginghouse-keepers, and, perhaps, the fly-drivers and other people to whom tourists bring grist to the mill. The advertising is paid for out of these voluntary funds, and there can be no objection to a course of that kind; but there must be a large number of ratepayers to whom it is of little concern whether the lodginghouse-keepers and fly-drivers derive an increased income from visitors or not, yet a burden would be put upon them by this Bill. I see by Clause 2 that the expenses incurred by a district council are to be defrayed out of any rate or fund applicable to the purposes of the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1907, and I conclude, therefore, that the expenses would be paid for by the ratepayers in the whole area of that district council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00096">I do not know what may be the view of His Majesty's Government upon this Bill. I only know what is their view on Bills of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0010"/>
<col>7</col>
a similar character which have been introduced in this House in this and the last session of Parliament. There was a Bill called the Dunoon Bill, which no doubt your Lordships may recollect. That proposed exactly the same thing as is contemplated in this Bill, and the Secretary for Scotland&#x2014;I regret that the noble Lord is not in his place&#x2014;said that there was no precedent in Scotland for allowing such advertising, and he strongly urged upon the Committee to whom the Bill was referred that they should reject that clause. Then a Bill was brought in last year by Margate, and the Home Secretary and the President of the Local Government Board both drew the attention of the Committee to whom that Bill was referred to this matter and and strongly urged that the clause enabling them to advertise at the expense of the ratepayers should be struck out of the Bill, and it was accordingly struck out by the Local Legislation Committee in another place. I do not know what view your Lordships as a whole may take of this Bill. I have felt it my duty to point out that it will be creating a precedent, and if your Lordships decide to give this Bill a Second Reading and pass it into law I confess I do not see how it will be possible either for me in your Lordships' House or for the Local Legislation Committee in the other House to refuse to allow English watering-places and seaside resorts to have the same powers in the way of advertising.</p>

<quote>"To leave out the word 'now' and to add at the end of the Motion the words ' this day three months.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Onslow.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00098"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like, with you Lordships' leave, to say a few words in support of this Bill. The noble Earl the Chairman of Committees did not mention to your Lordships that it was with the unanimous agreement of every member representing Ireland that the Bill was passed by the other House. He carefully avoided mentioning that important fact. Irish questions as a rule in the House of Commons are not taken in such good part by all parties as was the case with this Bill. With regard to the tourist question I suppose no one has worked harder than myself in regard to it, and the noble Earl the Leader of the House will remember perfectly well the first occasion when we brought forward the tourist question in
<col>8</col>
Ireland. He presided at that meeting, and there is another ex-Lord-Lieutenant here, Lord Cadogan, who will also remember the efforts everyone made, with no object of gain in view, to promote tourist traffic in Ireland.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has moved the rejection of this Bill stated that Lord Marchamley, in moving the Second Reading had appealed to the sentiment of your Lordships' House. I do not wish in any way to appeal to the sentiment of the House. I wish to appeal to the business instincts of the House. What we want is to be able to advertise these Irish resorts. We are not able to advertise them now in the way that rich communities in England are able to advertise their resorts. The noble Earl drew attention to the fact that when similar provisions appeared in Private Bills they were always opposed. But this is not a Private Bill. It was starred by His Majesty's Government, and was supported in the House of Commons by all the representatives from Ireland. Then the noble Earl mentioned Blackpool, and said the power possessed by Blackpool in this matter was given by inadvertence. Was not that the most lucky thing that ever happened to Blackpool? There is no desert shore in the world that has bloomed forth as it has done into the most wonderful watering-place of modern times. Why, all the flying machines have gone there&#x0021; But for the power of advertising Blackpool might have remained a shingly beach.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00099"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: It is all sand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00100"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Well, a sandy beach. Sand and shingle are very much the same thing, so far, at any rate, as the question of flying machines go. I think it was a very lucky thing for Blackpool that by inadvertence they were allowed to strike a rate for this purpose. Then the noble Earl said that if we had this power in Ireland it could not be refused by your Lordships to Margate, Ramsgate, and other places. I do not think that argument was a good one. You cannot compare the huge populations that seek fresh air in this country to the small populations in Ireland who are anxious that English people should come over and at all events see some of Ireland's most beautiful spots. There is something beyond the mere desire to advertise these places. I think it is a most
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0011"/>
<col>9</col>
excellent thing that the English people should come over to Ireland and learn the ways of the people there and how they live. But the noble Earl wants to stop them from coming.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00101"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00102"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: We cannot advertise these places in the same way that you can in England. With regard to what was said about the interests of the ratepayers, if there was any fear of the interests of the ratepayers suffering in this matter, I venture to think my countrymen would have taken very good care to protect their interests. As to this principle if granted in the case of Ireland extending to England, I can only say that I think the noble Earl is well able to take the necessary precautions in that matter both in regard to Private Bills and Public Bills. I myself am a ratepayer, like other noble Lords, in Ireland, and I should be sorry if any ratepayer from this side of the Channel should oppose this little Bill. The authorities who would make use of this Bill if passed are Cork, Queenstown, Killarney, Kingstown, Bray, Killaloe, and a number of towns in the North of Ireland. The Northern members in the House of Commons can take very good care of themselves, as the noble Earl knows, and if those members had the slightest suspicion that the ratepayers were going to be up in arms about the matter, they would not have given their unanimous support to the Bill. There is a consensus of opinion throughout Ireland that the Bill should become law, and I hope your Lordships will give it a Second Reading, in which case tie noble Earl will be able, if he thinks it necessary, to move any Amendment in Committee to further protect the interests of the ratepayers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00103"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of His Majesty's Government I have little to add to the arguments so ably put forward by my noble friend behind me and by the noble Earl who has just sat down. The fact that the Bill was supported by all the Irish members in the other House is in itself a very strong argument in its favour, and therefore we shall be glad to see the Bill pass into law. The noble Earl the Lord Chairman objected to the Bill on the ground that there, was no precedent for it. I am afraid it is occasionally my duty, as representing the Irish Office, to
<col>10</col>
introduce Bills for which there is no precedent at all, and I do not see that we should necessarily be deterred on that account from giving the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00104"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the House will feel that the Lord Chairman was well within his rights when he called attention to the peculiar provisions embodied in this Bill, because it is idle to conceal from oneself that the Bill is a very unusual Bill, and I am afraid I must add is one which conceivably might lead to considerable abuse. It is not difficult to imagine a, case in which a reckless expenditure of the ratepayers' money might take place, not for the benefit of the ratepayers generally, but for the benefit of hotel keepers and other people more immediately concerned in the tourist traffic. Therefore, like the noble Earl the Lord Chairman, I approach this Bill with a certain feeling of suspicion, but I think it is fair to consider the circumstances under which the Bill is brought before the House. It is apparently desired with absolute unanimity in Ireland; it is supported in another place again unanimously by members of Parliament who do not always act together in reference to such matters, and there is also this consideration which may, perhaps, be borne in mind. Development of tourist traffic in Ireland on anything like the present scale is a comparatively modern innovation, and my noble friend who spoke from the Bench behind and others who have been working with him have really within the last few years done an immense deal to bring about a knowledge and an appreciation of the very great attractions which that country offers to visitors. I speak with no particular prejudice in favour of these advertisements, because my attention was called to one the other day in which the enterprising proprietor of an hotel proclaimed to the public that his guests were entitled to free fishing in certain waters which happen to be my private property, and I can conceive an almost indefinite extension of practices of that kind. I think we must allow that in Ireland we are nothing if not illogical, and that a certain amount of indulgence on special Irish grounds may be claimed by the promoters of this Bill to such an extent that some of us who, on principle, are not entirely favourable to the measure, would not perhaps feel justified in going

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00105"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought I had a plain duty to perform to your Lordships' House to point out what I think this Bill may lead to. The arguments which have been addressed to your Lordships seem to me chiefly to have been of the kind which was adduced in excuse for Mrs. Easy's baby&#x2014;that it was but a little one&#x2014;and that Ireland is entitled to be treated quite differently from any other part of the United Kingdom. That appears to be the general view of noble Lords, and I shall, therefore, not put your Lordships to the trouble of dividing against the Bill; but I trust you will exonerate me if you find this practice spreading throughout the seaside towns and health resorts of England.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00109"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: I rise to move the insertion of a new clause after Clause 3. This, as your Lordships will see, deals with the question of regulations respecting priority, and the same subject is dealt with later under certain Amendments proposed by my noble friend behind me, Lord MacDonnell, and sought to be amended by other noble Lords. We have taken the view that it is not reasonable or desirable to insert these proposed provisions in the Act of Parliament. There is, in fact, no precedent that I can recall for doing anything of the kind. When the Act of 1903 was in progress Mr. Wyndham made certain forecasts of the manner in which and the amount to which advances would, as he believed, be made by the Treasury. The sum of five millions, with which your Lordships are so familiar, was first mentioned by him in that connection, and Mr. Wyndham's forecast has in the main been fulfilled, although, as we know, it has been to a certain degree exceeded of
<col>12</col>
late. When it became a question of whether certain classes of transactions should have precedence of others, it was done by regulation, as your Lordships are aware, in more than one instance. I took occasion on the Second Reading of the Bill to state what the form would probably be, as we hoped, of the advances. There is this general objection, I think, to placing provisions of this kind in an Act of Parliament, that so far as their general lines are concerned you gain nothing over and above the assurance which you receive as in this case from the responsible Government, because, of course, it would be impossible for any Government to go back as regards the general lines of assurances thus given; whereas if for any reason you want to make some small or slight alteration in the regulations you have to come to Parliament and pass a fresh Act through both Houses before you can alter them in the minutest particular. It therefore needs some justification, which we have not yet heard, for the insertion of these provisions in an Act instead of proceeding by way of regulation. My second subsection provides that the regulations should be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and, of course, therefore they will be subject to the criticism of both. It is also important to remember that under the Statutes which regulate publication notice has to be given to the public of the intention to make the regulations forty days before, and the draft regulations are open to public inspection, which enables anybody who desires when the regulations are laid before Parliament to take any exception, to be in a position to do so after full preparation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00110"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment does not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00111"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: But that is the law which governs all regulations. The Rules Publication Act, as the noble and learned Lord knows, compels them to be open to public inspection for forty days. As I say, that gives an opportunity before they are issued for anybody who considers himself aggrieved by them to study them with a view to causing criticism to be made, if he so desires, in Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00112"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My point is that there is no provision in this section that if either House of Parliament objects the regulations must be withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00115"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Surely not entirely useless, because I can conceive eases where the criticism might be so intelligent that it might lead to an alteration of the regulations. The safeguard, in fact, that is given is the safeguard of full publicity. I do not go further than that. We do not place them under Parliamentary control for reasons which noble Lords will understand. Therefore, although in the main I may say the proposals made by my noble friend behind me carry out the intentions of the Government and, speaking generally, embody what the regulations would be, we feel that it is not desirable to place them in an Act of Parliament; and unless noble Lords go so far as so say that they cannot trust us to put forward the regulations in the form which we indicate&#x2014;unless they go so far as that I am not quite clear what arguments they will produce for placing these regulations in the Act instead of leaving them to be carried out in the way which we propose. It is quite clear, and I think it was generally admitted by the noble Viscount on the Cross Benches and others, that nobody would propose to ask the Treasury to bind itself to advance a given sum in any given year. That, I think, is a subject of general agreement. But we have always said that our intention is to raise this five millions in cash until the block is wiped out. We then propose to place a restriction as regards one million for the purpose of purchase by the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board, or, in the form which your Lordships have now placed this Bill, by the Congested Districts Board through the Estates Commissioners, supposing that to be the form in which the Bill ultimately becomes law. I need not repeat the proposed allocation of the rest of the cash because I have already stated it more than once, and it is repeated, I think, in my noble friend's Amendment. I defer anything further that I may have to say on this point until I have heard what noble Lords have to say on the point of the inclusion of these provisions in the Bill at all, rather than the method of proceeding by regulation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00117"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member> said that as he had had the privilege of bringing this matter before their Lordships in the Committee stage, he might be allowed to follow the noble Earl. The noble Earl had said, and said very justly, that under the provisions of the Act of 1903 certain regulations were made. But the position now was quite exceptional. They had never had a condition of things such as this Bill would bring about. The Act of 1903 was entirely an Act for cash payment, and he could understand that the regulations in connection with that payment were very simple. But that case had passed away; they were now going to deal with three sorts of payments to three sorts of people, and while the noble Earl's Amendment would suffice for cash payments, he maintained that in the present case it did not go far enough, and that the exceptional treatment they were going to receive under the Bill required that this point should be dealt with in a separate and entirely different manner. The Amendment which he had been allowed to bring forward in Committee was, he admitted, not quite as distinct as he would have liked it to have been, and he was glad he was allowed to withdraw it. He considered that the whole question bristled with difficulties, and that potent instructions must be given to the Estates Commissioners who were going to deal with these vast sums of money. He could not imagine a Lord Lieutenant being placed in a more disagreeable position than that of having to suggest new treatment and to issue new regulations. On the question of stock, which he hoped to discuss later, it was difficult to deal fairly with the respective parties because they must not lose sight of the fact that there were fifty-two millions of property lodged on the faith of being paid in cash. He did not blame His Majesty's Government in the least for that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0014"/>
<col>15</col>
but still it showed that different conditions were necessary to allocate with a proper balance of justice between the respective parties&#x2014;those who wanted payment in cash, those who wanted payment in half stock and half cash, and those who wanted payment in stock&#x2014;all of which required separate registers as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell. He hoped the noble Earl would not press his Amendment, but would listen with favour to any remarks that might be made from that side of the House as to the amending of this clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00118"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said it would be in the recollection of their Lordships that when the noble Lord, Lord Langford, brought forward his Amendment he ventured to make certain suggestions with a view of possibly improving it. He felt with the noble Lord that the subject was one upon which certain definite regulations were desirable. Although he (Lord MacDonnell) believed that the Estates Commissioners had always endeavoured to perform their duties impartially, yet in certain instances suspicions did prevail in reference to priority of dealing with applications, and consequently a feeling of dissatisfaction existed which was out of all proportion to the cause. It also appeared to him that in the proposals of the noble Lord there were certain admirable suggestions which had not been previously brought into practice, and which it would be to the good of everybody to reduce into the form of rules. In the rules which were on the Paper that night he had endeavoured to incorporate Lord Langford's ideas, and generally to produce a scheme which he thought would be found workable in practice; but he agreed with the noble Earl the Leader of the House that it would be better if the rules were elastic, and that they should, if possible, avoid stereotyping them in the form of an enactment which would require another Act of Parliament to alter. If the noble Earl the Leader of the House would consider the proposals he had made and could see his way to embody them in the rules which he proposed to lay on the Table of the House, he certainly would not feel disposed to impede or inconvenience His Majesty's Government in this matter. He supposed the matter would come up for discussion on Clause 14, and he would point out that when rules were laid on the Table of both Houses they became nugatory if either House objected
<col>16</col>
to them. It might thus come to pass that on a most important matter, a matter upon which the efficient discharge of the duties of the Estates Commissioners would depend, a conflict between both Houses might produce the most serious inconvenience. That was a matter of great importance to be considered in deciding upon the question whether it was better to proceed in this instance by means of rules embodied in the Act or by means of regulations. When they came to that particular clause he would avail himself of the opportunity to make some further remarks on the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00119"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said that this was by no means a simple question, and one could discuss it without imputing the slightest vestige of bad faith to His Majesty's Government or suggesting for a moment their wish to do anything except what was perfectly fair. He felt fully the force of the argument that putting everything in black and white into a Statute that could not be changed was a serious matter and he appreciated the advantages in many ways of having regulations that might be varied according to the exigencies of practice and of experience; but he thought that the noble Earl the Leader of the House asked in this Amendment for too blind a trust. There was no suggeston from the beginning to the end of this very innocent looking clause that any regard was to be paid at all to priority. Absolute power was taken to the Executive in the matter. If they found that a certain number of estates had by energy been got in the list early and had made all their arrangements, regard had to be paid to that, but absolute power was given to the Executive to decide the priority. He knew that Lord MacDonnell had tried to work out fair results, but he was not sure that he was prepared, after having read his Amendments, to think they were the best that could be drafted. As he understood, Lord MacDonnell's suggestion was that first there should be a general register, in which regard should be paid in framing it to the priority of dates.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00120"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: A sort of day book, in which every entry should be put down, and then carried to the registers, which are a sort of ledgers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00121"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said that was what he understood. There was first a general register, which was to be framed according to the dates. That was the vulgar way of ascertaining priority. That was called the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0015"/>
<col>17</col>
general register. And then the noble Lord said there would be three subsidiary registers, and here it was that he (Lord Ashbourne) was to a certain extent unable to follow the argument. Once the entries were taken from the general register and put into the three subsidiary registers, as far as those entries were concerned the general register was bid goodbye to; it need not be looked to again. What were those three subsidiary registers? He did not clearly know. One was A and another was B, and then there was one that was supposed to contain those who were satisfied to be paid altogether by stock. Well, but how were they to secure the priorities, clashing priorities, priorities that were not agreed upon?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00122"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: It is stated in the section.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00123"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he had read it more than once, and he still asked how were they to be ascertained? The dates in the general register were clear enough, but each subsidiary register must have separate priorities for itself. How were they to recognise each of the three subsidiary registers so as to bring out the competing priorities in a way to give satisfaction?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00124"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: They do not compete.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00128"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that when the office was opened in the morning, the people&#x2014;A, B, C, and D&#x2014;would be there ready with their documents to deposit. A deposited his documents with the particulars, they were noted down in the register, and he said "I want to be paid in cash." B came on and deposited his documents and particulars and said the same thing, that he wanted to be paid in cash. C came and depositing his documents said, "I wish to be paid in stock." while D, after depositing his papers, said he wished to be paid partly in stock and partly in cash. And so on to the end of the day; as people came their names and the
<col>18</col>
facts of their applications were entered in this general register. They need not call it a register. They could call it a day list. At the end of the day clerks would be set to work and A, who had presented his papers first and claimed cash, was entered in the cash payments register first on the list. B, who came after him, and also wanted cash, was entered next on the list. C, who came after the other two, but wished to be paid in stock was entered first in the stock register; and D, who came last and wished to be paid partly in stock and partly in cash was entered in the cash and stock register. When it came to paying each, the payments were made from different funds. The man who wanted cash did not want stock. Consequently the priority in the stock register was of no consequence to him. He only looked to the priority in the cash register. In the same; way the man who wanted cash and stock did not care what happened to the other two. Consequently the priority, once they were entered in the register, was the priority in the register in which they were entered. There could be no mistake if that wore done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00129"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he was afraid there could be a mistake; not in the noble Lord's statement, but as to the hand that would enter in the register the particular figures. Would they be entitled to do anything to secure a priority outside of the fact of the position in the subsidiary registers? There were three or four methods to be considered. One, the voluntary method of sale between landlord and tenant. Then there was the method of buying voluntarily by the Estates Commissioners. Then there was the method of the Land Judge, who might sell under his jurisdiction; and finally there might be those who might be created under this Bill, the people who were compelled to sell by compulsory sales. What was the position of these four people among themselves? There was the compulsory sale. Was it intended if a compulsory sale was carried out that it should be paid for in cash?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00130"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: Those are not registered.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00134"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: They are registers of applications only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00135"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said that might be so, but the noble Lord's Amendment from beginning to end, though most carefully framed, did not indicate that there was to be any special or different regard paid to the source from which the entry came. He had indicated four. The landlord who sold voluntarily to his tenant was one. The Estates Commissioners buying voluntarily was another. The Estates Commissioners buying compulsorily was another. The Land Judge, proceeding by the mechanism of his Court, was another. There was nothing in the clause to show it, there was a confusion likely to arise amongst them, that any regard was to be had to the special priorities that might come up between them. The matter was not simple. He gave credit for good faith to everyone, but he was not satisfied that the noble Earl's clause would work out necessarily well, because it asked too blind a trust, and it did not give on the face of the clause any guidance to the Executive to work it out. He was disposed to think that the noble Lord's Amendment, which he presumed would not be taken at the same time as the clause of the noble Earl, would not of itself give guidance. He admitted that the noble Lord had framed it with an honest desire to do this, but although the noble Lord was, of course, quite capable of grasping, he had not grasped in a way that was clear to his (Lord Ashbourne's) mind the various difficulties that might arise amongst competing priorities. Though they might have an interesting discussion on this question now, he did not see how they could entirely escape from its renewal on the final stage of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00136"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> thought the two objections were unanswerable. First of all, they could embody all these provisions in an Act of Parliament, but that would make them too rigid. He thought that was clear. He felt that on the other side his noble and learned friend's objection was equally well founded. The noble Earl the Leader of the House asked for absolute trust, and proposed another new clause by which, under subsection (8) of Section 23 of the Act of 1903, regulations might be laid before Parliament, and they might
<col>20</col>
be enforced. He did not think any satisfactory and workable method could be arrived at except in the form he was about to suggest. It was that the regulations should be put into a schedule, and then they would take powers under the Bill to modify the schedule from time to time with a provision that any order or variation made by the Lord Lieutenant modifying the schedule should lie upon the Table of each House of Parliament for forty days during the time Parliament was sitting, and if any resolution should be carried in either House against the variation, the modification should not be carried out. They would thus get a set of rules which would be fairly useful, but would not be so rigid, because they might be changed from time to time according as the necessity arose. That method was followed in the Local Government Act of 1898 to avoid making it unduly lengthy, and they provided that orders might be made adjusting the provisions of a number of Acts given in the schedule. The difference there was, of course, that there was a final adaptation, but here they might adapt from time to time as the occasion arose. A new point might arise at any time, but they could provide that the order modifying the rules should lie on the Table of the Houses of Parliament, and if a resolution was carried against it, it should not be carried out. That would not bring the thing to a standstill, as Lord MacDonnell feared; it would enable them to proceed under the schedule and get a modification from time to time until something further could be done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00137"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> remarked that the noble Earl the Leader of the House had got one in, so to speak, before Lord MacDonnell had managed to get his guard up at all. Noble Lords from Ireland did not approve of the means proposed by the noble Earl for dealing with what his noble friend Lord Langford had described as quite a new state of affairs. The Lord Lieutenant, who was really the Chief Secretary, was to determine the priority of stock and cash payments and so on. That was an enormous responsibility to put upon anyone. He noticed that Lord MacDonnell said that if the noble Earl would embody in his rules and regulations Lord MacDonnell's suggestions that appeared further on in the list of Amendments, he would be, so to speak, satisfied. But that did not satisfy noble Lords
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0017"/>
<col>21</col>
from Ireland in any way. They thought that that would be impossible for the noble Earl to do, and he was sure the noble Earl would feel so too. But a suggestion had been put forward by Lord Atkinson that there should be a schedule, and that that schedule should be subject to alteration from time to time by the Lord Lieutenant or the Chief Secretary. That, he thought, was a very reasonable and commonsense view to take of the matter, and it might be the means of getting them out of this difficulty. He did not know how it commended itself to the noble Earl. The noble Earl had referred to trusting the Government. He trusted the noble Earl, but his trust in the Chief Secretary was much more modified than the trust he reposed in the noble Earl. It was much better to be quite frank about the matter, and those were their feelings. He hoped the noble Earl would consider the suggestion made by Lord Atkinson with regard to the schedule and the regulations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00138"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> thought the noble Earl the Leader of the House would see that some modification of the clause was desirable. As the clause stood, although they had the fullest confidence in the intentions of the noble Earl, there was nothing to determine the priority in which the Lord Lieutenant might order advances to be made. On the other hand, the discussion which had taken place rather prematurely on Lord MacDonnell's Amendments showed that it was very difficult, at all events in the body of the Bill, to embody all the regulations which it might be desirable should be made. He suggested to the noble Earl that they should have some governing words to the clause which he was submitting, and that subsequently, if thought well, Lord Atkinson's proposal could be adopted. He therefore moved to add to the first subsection of Lord Crewe's Amendment the provision that "such allocation shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, preserve the priority in which purchase agreements have been lodged with the Land Commission." Those words were not absolutely binding, but they showed a clear intention which would enable Parliament at any subsequent stage to treat them as a basis of any arrangement which it might be necessary to make. He moved that these words be now inserted as governing words without in any way prejudicing the question raised by Lord Atkinson of including in the schedule
<col>22</col>
such regulations as might be found desirable in accordance with the Amendments submitted by Lord MacDonnell.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00139">Amendment moved to the Amendment&#x2014;
<quote>"To add at the end of the first subsection the words 'But such allocation shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, preserve the priority in which purchase agreements have been lodged with the Land Commission.'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Midleton.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00140"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said it appeared to him that even the noble Viscount's Amendment did not give quite the security they desired. The words were that "as far as was reasonably practicable" the order of priority should be preserved. It might be found that it was not convenient to preserve that priority. It might be thought expedient to give payments in stock priority over payments in cash, and if the Treasury found that this was the most convenient course, it might be then said that it was not reasonably practicable to preserve the original priority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00141"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: On the suggestion of the noble Viscount I have to say this. It does not seem to me that his Amendment carries out the expressed intention of His Majesty's Government with regard to the various priorities. His Amendment makes no allusion whatever to the fact that we propose to divide the whole number of pending agreements into classes, to be dealt with <i>pari passu</i>, and all retaining their general priority on the list only so far as that priority can be applied to the class to which they themselves belong. That is to say, suppose that the first three or four millions of transactions were put forward by people who were first in time but who refused to take anything except cash, and a vendor came forward who was prepared to take only stock. On our system he would come in at the top of his class, and be considered <i>pari passu</i> with number one of those who were prepared to take cash, and similarly with regard to those who were prepared to take stock and cash together. Our object is to maintain priority in point of time so far as we can consistently with the division into three classes. If you do not do this, it is evident that you give no advantage in point of time to those who are prepared to take stock, and, as we know, it is not quite so pleasant to take stock
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0018"/>
<col>23</col>
as it is to take cash. If you do not give priority nobody will take stock at all, and you may as well leave the provision out of your financial clauses. Assume that a gentlemen called A is at the top of the cash class. Another gentleman called B is at the top of the stock class, and C is at the top of the mixed class. Those cases will all be taken <i>pari passu</i> at the same time as far as possible. D is a cash gentleman. He will come second, but where he will gain or may gain is that B and C being before him on the list would have had to be considered in any case on a system of pure priority before him, whereas now he will be promoted in point of time from the fourth place to the second, and so on all through. Now the Amendment of the noble Viscount seems to me to leave this fact altogether out of account, and merely to draw attention to the fact that general priority in time without any reference to class or the character of the transaction is alone to be respected. Apart from those three we have the case of the sales to the Estates Commissioners and those of a compulsory character. Those must stand in a different class, because they are <i>ex hypothesi</i> of a somewhat urgent character in the public interest, and although we do not want to mass them in front of the other transactions, yet they must be treated as a class apart, and have their places in point of priority in that particular class. You have therefore the four sets, all of them proceeding <i>pari passu</i>, and indeed we hope to include, as time goes on, a certain number even of a fifth class&#x2014;that is, those who come in future agreements, because those are payable in stock. The whole question, as your Lordships well know, is governed by the fact that we have only so far as we can tell these five millions of actual money, and we think that if with five millions we ought to try to effect ten millions of transactions, this offers the best chance of doing it. Now as regards the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord (Lord Atkinson), which I fully recognise is intended to be of a thoroughly helpful character, I am afraid we see strong objection to that course. We do not think it is a desirable thing that whenever an amendment is made at any future time in such regulations, although it may not be of a very serious character, that there should be prospects of a debate about it, not always on its actual merits, but possibly for some other reason, in either or in both Houses of Parliament.
<col>24</col>
We see no immediate prospect of altering the general principle on which these priorities are to be governed, and we must adhere to the view that it is not really necessary in the interests of anybody to attempt to describe them in detail either in the body of the Bill or in the schedule. I heard with regret what fell from the Earl of Mayo as to my right hon. friend the Chief Secretary. I am bound to say that I desire no personal compliments at the expense of my right hon. friend, and I venture to say that when I make a statement, or any Minister makes a statement, on behalf of the Government, I expect it to be accepted on behalf of the Government without any reference to cither my personal qualities or those of any other Minister. I regret, therefore, that the noble Earl should have made that allusion in the manner in which he did. I fear, however, that we must stand out for the clause as it appears on the Paper, and must, if necessary, divide upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00142"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I will only ask the noble Earl the Leader of the House whether he thinks he has sufficiently considered that the form of words proposed by the noble Viscount really does admit of a certain amount of elasticity in the interpretation of these regulations. I quite understand the point made by the noble Earl a few moments ago, that these applications fall within four different categories, and that there may be a tendency for applications to gravitate towards one category or another, and that an application which is, say, seventh in point of time on the general list may turn out to be number one in a less popular category. That, I think, is the noble Earl's point; but is not that covered by the noble Viscount's suggestion that the "allocation shall so far as is reasonably practicable preserve the priority" in which the agreements are lodged with the Land Commission? I think that was the object with which my noble friend drew his words, and if the noble Earl would add additional words making it clear that this priority was to be looked for, having regard to the distribution of the applications as between the different classes of applications, I have no doubt that the noble Viscount would be glad to consider a proposal to amend his Amendment. But I am afraid on this side of the House we do feel that it is necessary to insert in this Amendment some words indicating generally that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0019"/>
<col>25</col>
the principle of priority must be kept in mind by those who will interpret this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00143"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Of course, I can only speak again by the indulgence of the House because I have already spoken on the noble Viscount's Amendment, but I do not quite follow what is in the mind of the noble Viscount or the noble Marquess, and I fail to see what it is exactly they are afraid of. Are they afraid that the Estates Commissioners will deliberately postpone pending applications in favour of number 9 or number 10 or number 20 upon the list, other things being equal? Or is the object of the noble Viscount that the indirect sales&#x2014;that is to say, the sales through the Estates Commissioners&#x2014;should have no advantage over the ordinary direct sales? It was not quite clearly explained by the noble Viscount. I do not know that there ever has been any imputation against the Estates Commissioners that they have, so to speak, darted about from date to date, and given some vendor an undue preference over a man who lodged an agreement before him. I was under the impression that, subject to the fact that the sales of the Estates Commissioners were for the reason I have given held to have a certain claim to have a priority of their own, as regards the ordinary transactions of the office the priority had always been maintained, and I have never heard any imputation to the contrary. Perhaps the noble Viscount will explain.</membercontribution></p>

A certain number might say they were ready to take stock, and in that event those estates, being apparently available at the beginning of the financial year, might be put in the forefront, and without regard to priority those estates might be taken. The Commissioners would then say, "we are full of applications in respect of vendors who will take stock, and we require a very small amount of cash." That would be a very hard measure on those landlords who could not afford to take anything but cash. There was a, second difficulty. The noble Earl knew that those who were compelled to sell were to be paid in cash and not stock, and there might be a considerable number of those on whom compulsion was brought to bear in the course of a single year.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00150">Amendment, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00151"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> moved a new clause providing that where a vendor under future purchase agreements received payment in stock instead of cash, superior interests payable out of the purchase money to the Crown, the Land Commission, the Commissioners of Public Works, or any public Department should be received and paid in stock upon the like terms as payment in stock had been received by the vendor. The same question was raised in the Committee stage, and he thought the noble Earl, in his reply, devoted nearly the whole of his attention to pending agreements. The noble Earl said, in effect, that if any vendor who had a pending agreement chose to wait till the Greek Kalends he might hope to be paid in cash, and therefore it was rather unfair to ask a Government Department to receive stock when he could get cash and pay them in cash. That was with regard to pending agreements; but with regard to future agreements they must be paid in stock. The vendor had no option in the matter. He suffered most. The noble Earl had explained that the bonus averaged four and a-half per cent. less than that obtainable under the Act of
<col>28</col>
1903, and in addition to that there was the depreciated stock. The noble Earl had told them that it did not matter so much that the stock was depreciated, because it was such an excellent investment that people would keep it and would not realise it; but, unfortunately, they would have to realise it if the Government Departments insisted upon being paid in cash. What was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander, and he thought his was a most reasonable suggestion. The noble Earl had said he might be inclined to consider this in the case of future agreements, and he hoped the noble Earl would tell them that this very reasonable proposition might be accepted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00152">Amendment moved&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00153"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has stated his case with moderation, but I am afraid I cannot on behalf of the Government hold out any hope of accepting this provision. We do not feel it is possible, supposing any loss to take place, that we should place such a loss on departments who are in no sense parties to the purchase, and who therefore are rather in the position of an ordinary encumbrancer. For instance, supposing that a loss arises over a Board of Works Loan. The loss then falls on the local funds, and that means that it has to be met by other borrowers, which I suppose the noble Lord would not contemplate, or the deficiency would have to be made up by a vote. Therefore we do not feel able to fall in with the noble Lord's suggestion. I admit, of course, that he has modified it considerably by making it refer to future agreements, but I hope the noble Lord will be disposed not to press it, even in its modified form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00154"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> desired to point out, as his noble friend had pointed out in Committee, that the case was a far larger one than the noble. Earl seemed to imagine. The loans referred to by the noble Earl were a very small percentage of the cases that would come under this clause if it passed. This clause dealt with the repayment of interests, many of them centuries old, interests dating from the time when the land was originally acquired from the Crown; and landlords were going to be put in this position, that in every future sale, in order to redeem the superior interests, which must be redeemed&#x2014;it was not possible for a landlord to say he was ready to go on paying the annual amount, he must redeem them&#x2014;the landlord would have to sell stock obviously at a very much lower price than he received it from the Government. He confessed he could see only one way out of it. These superior interests were redeemed at a price fixed, not fixed by the Government, but fixed in accordance with the procedure under the Act of 1903. As a rule, he thought these superior interests had been redeemed in the past at the price of twenty-seven years purchase. Those who had to redeem these superior interests in the future would go to the arbitrator and ask for the price to be refixed, and one of the things on which they
<col>30</col>
would base that request, he assumed, would be the fact that they had to incur a very large loss, and he thought that, fact might be: considered by the arbitrator and that the price of redemption might consequently be reduced. It was, therefore, possible that the Government might yet suffer the loss which at present they thought they were avoiding and putting entirely on the shoulders of the landlord. That was the only hope he had in face of the refusal of the noble Earl.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00155"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said he did not know whether his noble friend intended to divide the House on his Amendment, but he would point out to the noble Earl the Leader of the House what he thought had not yet occurred to him, and that was that at this moment the Government had no power to accept stock instead of cash. A case might arise in which the one thing which the Government might wish to avoid would be the depreciation of their own stock, and they would desire to avoid a large quantity of stock being thrown on the market. The obvious justice of his noble friend's proposal must commend itself to all; and he suggested that it might be possible for the Government to accept the Amendment, with the alteration of "shall" to "may" in the provision that "superior interests&#x2026;shall be received and paid in stock." It was obvious, if it was not in the power of the Government to accept stock, that cases might arise in which they would be actually prohibited from paying out stock by the large amount put on the market by the vendors being forced to sell.</p>

to insert, after the words "cash portion of that fund," the words "and is available in excess of the sum of five thousand pounds and twenty thousand pounds now charged on that fund for the benefit of Trinity College, Dublin, and the Congested Districts Board respectively." He said that the Amendment as it appeared on the Notice Paper was incorrect, as he intended it only to apply to the Congested Districts Board. It would now read, "and is available in excess of the sum of twenty thousand pounds now charged on that fund for the benefit of the Congested Districts Board." He had put this Amendment upon the Paper with the object of getting some assurance from His Majesty's Government that it was not their intention to give to the Congested Districts Board with one hand and to take away with the other. At the present time the Congested Districts Board received two sums of &#x00A3;20,000 and &#x00A3;25,000. The sum of &#x00A3;20,000 was charged on the Development Grant, and the &#x00A3;25,000 was a Parliamentary Grant made to the Congested Districts Board in 1899. Both his Amendment in Clause 6 and the subsequent Amendment in Clause 40 were devised with the object of making sure that these two sums of &#x00A3;20,000 and &#x00A3;25,000 should be preserved to the Congested Districts Board. If he received that assurance from His Majesty's Government he would be satisfied and would withdraw his Amendment, but if he did not receive that assurance he would be compelled to divide the House upon it. As the Bill now stood, the Treasury took over the loss by flotation on all pending agreements, and they said that so far as the Development Grant lasted, the interest and sinking fund on those losses should be charged against the Development Grant. The &#x00A3;20,000 was charged against the Development Grant by executive order, and there was nothing to prevent the Government from ordering to-morrow that this &#x00A3;20,000 should be no longer paid to the Congested Districts Board. He did not think it was the intention of the other House, and certainly he did not think it was the wish of the Irish people, that any money which the Congested Districts Board now enjoyed should be taken from it. The operations of the Board had been greatly restricted by lack of funds. They looked forward to an increase of funds and not to a process of
<col>32</col>
giving with one hand and taking away with the other in so far as these two sums of &#x00A3;20,000 and &#x00A3;25,000 were concerned. In the absence of any assurance from His Majesty's Government he begged to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00176"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member><membercontribution>: There are agreements which are made in the Land Judge's Court which are not lodged with the Land Commission at the time. They are lodged in the first place in the Land Court. The Land Judge sells certain estates, and these agreements are lodged in his Court and not in that of the Land Commission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00177"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Well, I am not so cognisant of the proceedings as the noble Lord. I was under the impression that in every case agreements entered into by the Land Judge or with the Land Judge were lodged with the Estates Commissioners, but, of course, if the noble Lord says it is not so, I must ask leave to look into the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00178"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said this was a technical point. Under Section 7 of the Act of 1903 the Estates Commissioners might proceed and buy estates pending sale before the Land Judge's Court. If that agreement was carried out, well and good. If it was not carried out, and they withdrew, then the parties were driven back to Section 40 of the Act of 1896. That section and the other earlier Acts required that when an estate was for sale in the Land Judge's Court the Judge should divide it into lots for the purpose of selling it to the tenants. There was a long procedure. The Judge made an offer to the tenant, and if the tenant accepted, that acceptance and the offer was an agreement for sale under the Land Purchase Acts, and it was to those agreements to which his noble friend referred. "To lodge" was not exactly the term to use as far as the Land Judge's Court was concerned; the agreements were created there, because the procedure was
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0024"/>
<col>35</col>
that the Land Judge made an offer to the tenant, and if the tenant accepted the offer, then the Act said they should be deemed to be created an agreement for the sale of the land to the tenant, and all the provisions of the Land Act were to apply as if an agreement had been entered into for the sale and the purchase. It was necessary, although there were not many cases, to include those in the words "pending purchase agreements" or else it might happen that agreements which had been entered into there by means of that machinery would not come within the words "pending purchase agreements" within the meaning of the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00179"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Lord would bring up the Amendment again on the Third Reading in the amended form as suggested by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, and we can then discuss the matter again.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00180"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> did not think that was necessary, as the words "entered into" were already in the clause, and would meet what the noble Earl desired. Surely it was more convenient to insert these words now with a view to the Government moving them out afterwards if they so desired.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00181"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Well, I have no objection to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00182">On Question, Amendments agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00183"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> moved a new clause after Clause 13. He said this clause was originally on the Paper in the form of an Amendment to Clause 14. He had put it on the Paper now owing to his anxiety to remove what he thought was the only blot that had ever been established on the zone system. In proposing this he did not think he came against the rule about infringing the privileges of the House of Commons. In Section 24, subsection (8), of the Act of 1903 it was clear by implication that the purchase money might contain one year's rent. The section read&#x2014;
<quote>"In the case of the sale of an estate where at any date hereinafter mentioned arrears of rent were due in respect of any holding on an estate a sum equivalent in amount to those arrears but not exceeding in any case one year's rent shall be paid out of the purchase money to the person who would have been entitled to receive those arrears."</quote>
<col>36</col>
In other words, where the tenant for life was the owner of a limited interest and sold the estate for a certain sum, the arrears belonged to him. He was entitled to receive out of the purchase money a sum equivalent to one year's rent on the foot of those arrears. That section must have been passed upon the assumption that a sum equivalent to one year's rent was included. In other words, the purchase money was increased by that amount in respect of the arrears so due, because the person who was entitled to receive it was not merely the owner but the tenant for life, and the arrears belonged to him, and by reason of that fact one year's Tent of the purchase money would be paid in respect of the arrears. It would be unjust to follow that course unless the purchase money had been increased by that sum. Accordingly his Amendment was putting in expressly what the section implied&#x2014;namely, enacting that where the Commissioners were satisfied that the purchase money included a sum more than one year's rent in respect of the arrears, they might refuse to sanction the advance unless the parties to the agreement of purchase and sale consented to the purchase money being reduced. If they consented, they could proceed as if the agreement had been entered into for the reduced sum, and all further agreements could be made on that basis. It was necessary to have this in order that parties might not lose the priority. If land was sold with five or six years of arrears due and three or four years purchase money was added in respect of those arrears, and money was advanced by the Government, it was advanced not to purchase the land but to pay the debts of the tenant. He thought that was not a legitimate use of the zone system. One year's arrears was adopted under the 1903 Act, and he therefore proposed to do expressly what had been done impliedly, and to guard against the only abuse which had ever been shown in connection with the operation of the zone system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00184">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"After Clause 13, to insert the following new-clause:</quote>
<quote>'14. Where, after the passing of this Act, application is made under subsection (1) of section one of the Act of 1903 for an advance of the whole purchase money of any holding, the Land Commission are satisfied that a sum exceeding one year's rent of the holding has been added to the purchase money thereof, in respect of arrears of rent due thereout, they may refuse to sanction the advance,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0025"/>
<col>37</col>
unless the parties to the agreement of purchase and sale consent that the purchase money shall be reduced by the amount of such excess over one year's rent. On such consent being given the said agreement shall be varied accordingly, and the application dealt with under the aforesaid subsection in its proper order as if the reduced sum had been the whole of the purchase money, and the application had been originally made in respect of that sum. The refusal to make the advance on the ground aforesaid must be concurred in by the Judicial Commissioner.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Atkinson.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00185"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I quite appreciate the desire of the noble and learned Lord to meet the case dealt with in his Amendment&#x2014;a case which is, I think, by common consent one of impropriety as regards the use of the zones. In that way a number of years arrears are made to form part of the purchase money. We take a certain degree of exception to the noble and learned Lord's Amendment partly on the ground that we do not think it covers all the necessary cases. It does not, for instance, meet the case of tenants who are several years in an ear and who are put by their landlord in the position of either having to buy on certain terms, or to remain as they are, and who are for the purpose of the purchase not free agents. Real freedom of contract cannot exist in a case of that kind, where the tenant is weighed down by a number of years arrears. That is an instance where we think the noble Lord's proposed clause is incomplete. But there is also a further difficulty as regards how the machinery is to be brought about. How are the Land Commission to be satisfied that a sum exceeding one year's rent of the holding has been added to the purchase money thereof? What means have they got of knowing that this is done? All that comes before the Land Commission is an application to advance a certain sum of money for the purchase of the particular holding; they have no power to inquire how the purchase money has been made up; they have no means of knowing whether it includes arrears of rent or not. The noble and learned Lord shakes his head, but I am given to understand that that is so, and it seems to me to stand to reason that it must be so. As we first drew the Bill we had a subsection which gave the Commissioners power to inquire in any case where they thought the circumstances demanded it, but the noble and learned Lord gives no such power, and in the absence of any such provision I maintain the opinion that the Estates Commissioners have no means of discovering
<col>38</col>
the circumstance to which the noble Lord wishes their attention to be drawn. I am not quite certain about the drafting of the last two lines. I should have thought that to say, "The refusal to make the advance on the ground aforesaid must be concurred in by the Judicial Commissioner," would almost appear to place upon him an obligation to concur, and it seems to me as if the noble Lord's sentence was in that respect incomplete. But apart from that, we do object to bring in the Judicial Commissioner for administrative functions of this kind. He has always been kept clear of matters of this sort; he has always been a Judge and a Judge only, and we do not like dragging him in for purposes which involve administrative discussion. For that reason, my Lords, we should in any case like to see that left out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00186"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that the noble Earl was entirely in error in saying that the Commissioners could not inquire into the circumstances. In the case of Weir's Estate, they sought to inquire into the amount of the arrears for the purpose of determining whether the security was good, and the order made by the Court was that they were not entitled to get that information because they had no right to inquire into the security, and they would not allow them to ask for information upon a subject as to which they had no jurisdiction. If the noble Earl, however, were to read the orders, he would clearly see that there was a distinct decision by the Court of Appeal in Ireland that the Commissioners had a right to inquire in reference to any matter over which they had jurisdiction, and therefore when he gave the Commission jurisdiction to reject the proposal if more than one year's arrears of rent had been added to the purchase money, that necessarily involved, according to the decision, that they had power to make inquiry about that over which they had jurisdiction to decide.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00187"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> only desired to say one word to make it clear that they were unable to support the Amendment of his noble and learned friend, not from any want of sympathy with the principle he laid down but because they had very great doubt of the application of the proposed new clause. He did not suppose that any one on that side of the House wished a large amount of arrears to be added to the purchase money, but what the noble and
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0026"/>
<col>39</col>
earned Lord did not allow sufficiently for was that in many eases what was added on as arrears was deducted from the natural number of years purchase which might have been and should have been asked for the holding. It was perfectly well known that Irish tenants who had got three or four years arrears of rent were glad to feel that those could be wiped out in some way by purchase, and it might suit the landlord to name eighteen years' purchase when he otherwise would have named twenty or twenty-one, allowing it to be understood that the arrears were added on in such cases to the price. The first objection to the noble and learned Lord's new clause was that there was absolutely no finality. The Land Commission might feel bound to inquire into many cases where holdings were sold below a particular level; they might find tenants with no arrears and others with arrears, and be plunged into a sea of difficulty. The main security for the taxpayer was to be found in the number of years purchase giving a large reduction to the tenant purchaser in what he was in future going to pay, and so long as that large reduction existed he did not think the method by which the calculation was arrived at between the parties was quite so material as his noble and learned friend seemed to think, and he was sure that the clause would have very little chance of settling the question. He hoped, therefore, that his noble and learned friend would not think it necessary to divide their Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00188">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00189"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>, in moving to insert at the beginning of Part II. the new Clause 14, of which he had given notice, embodying provisions as to priority with respect to advances, said he thought the new state of things which would be called into being by the establishment of three systems of payment&#x2014;payment in cash, payment partly in cash and partly in stock, and payment in stock&#x2014;would render it totally impracticable to have only one list of priority. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, stated that there were several methods of selling land under the Land Purchase Acts. There were sales through the Land Court, sales by owners to the Estates Commissioners, and direct sales from landlord to tenant in accordance with purchase agreements. The last category of sales were the only sales
<col>40</col>
covered by his Amendment. The first words of his proposed new clause were, "As regards advances under the Land Purchase Acts whether in pursuance of pending or future purchase agreements." There were some &#x00A3;50,000,000 worth of agreements already deposited with the Estates Commissioners, and the land to be sold in Ireland on future agreements was variously estimated at from &#x00A3;70,000,000 to &#x00A3;90,000,000, and those two categories&#x2014;the &#x00A3;50,000,000 agreements deposited and the &#x00A3;70,000,000 to &#x00A3;90,000,000 agreements to be deposited&#x2014;were the only agreements to be covered by his proposals. The future purchases were to be in stock altogether. Therefore their entry on one register would necessarily determine their priority, and the priority with regard to agreements for which stock was to be paid could have no effect upon priority with regard to agreements for which cash or cash and stock were to be paid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00190">The idea he had endeavoured to embody in his proposal was that there should be a general register, a sort of day book which would show hour by hour what the transactions were. Solicitors came into the Estates Commissioner's Office with the agreements which they had to deposit, they presented a memorandum showing the name of the landlords and certain particulars which would be prescribed, and they would be entered on the lists in the order of priority, first come, first served. At a later period the register would be gone over and all those who asked for payment in cash would have their names carried to a particular register&#x2014;Register A&#x2014;in the priority in which they stood in the general register, and there would be no necessity in future to refer to the general register so far as they were concerned. Then they had to deal with vendors who desired to be paid partly in cash and partly in stock. They would be dealt with in the same way, and carried to the second register, B, according to their priority in the general register. Then came the third class&#x2014;stock; the names would be carried to the stock register, C, according to their priority. That was the general rule which now prevailed, that a person got priority in the order in which he was entered upon the general register.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00191">But, as was pointed out the other evening, it might well be that when a
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0027"/>
<col>41</col>
vendor's name was entered in the register he had afterwards to perform certain legal obligations before the Estates Commissioners could take notice of his claim. Those obligations were fulfilled by his solicitor, and some solicitors were more active in looking after their clients' interests than others. Consequently it might happen, and it frequently had happened, that a vendor whoso name had been entered say in the month of January was still in arrear with the performance of those legal obligations at the end of the year, while another vendor whose name had been entered in February had completed all his legal obligations perhaps by October. The question then was whether all these vendors who had fulfilled the obligations resting upon them at an earlier date than persons whose names were entered before them on the list, should wait until all those persons who had priority on the list had performed their legal obligations. It might happen in that way that they would have a great block of work. To take a large estate of say &#x00A3;20,000 a year, it might require a year to perform all the necessary legal business in regard to that estate, while smaller estates, the vendors of which had entered their names after the owner of the large estate, had performed their duties very quickly and asked the Estates Commissioners to dispose of their business. If the Estates Commissioners were under a legal obligation to postpone dealing with the small estates until the large estate had completed all its legal obligations, there would be a block in the Estates Commissioners' office and there would be general dissatisfaction. That was a point which the noble Lord, Lord Langford, brought to notice, and it seemed to him that he made a most valuable suggestion&#x2014;namely, that the Estates Commissioners should not take up an estate in the order of priority of presentation of the documents merely, but that the order of priority in which the legal functions were performed should also be taken into account. He had endeavoured to incorporate that suggestion in his proposal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00192">There was another point. Where the Estates Commissioners had taken up a case in respect of which all the preliminary legal proceedings had been fulfilled, they deputed an inspector to visit the place and see whether the property was security for the advance, or, if it was within the zones, whether the tenant was in occupation.
<col>42</col>
A large staff of inspectors would be required, and it might very well happen that one inspector was able to perform his duties quickly and expeditiously, the work being easy, while another inspector was later in submitting his report. It might also be the case that there was heavier work on an estate which had priority on the list. Were; the Estates Commissoners to postpone dealing with such a case as he had mentioned until the heavier-weighted inspector had made his report, or were they to take up the business as it came into their office and dispose of it? Unless power and discretion were given to the Estates Commissioners to deal with cases as they came in, having no regard to priority on the registers, there would be a great block of work and dissatisfaction and demands for larger establishments. There had been suspicion, although in most cases there was no ground for it, that matters were not disposed of in the exact priority in which cases were deposited, and he thought it well that any suspicions of such a kind in the performance of public duties should be obviated and precautions taken to prevent their recurrence. In such a scheme as he had placed on the Paper he thought they went as far as they reasonably could go in securing that there should be a regular uniform practice and as little should be left to the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of particular officers as possible. He, however, felt himself very unwilling to push his own views as against the superior wisdom of His Majesty's Government in such a matter and if he were assured by the noble Earl who led the Government that in considering any rules which the Government might find necessary they would bear in mind the suggestions he had made, he would be glad, if it would facilitate the proceedings of their Lordships' House, to withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00203"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think we shall all agree that although my noble friend's Amendment as it stands on the Paper is not compatible with the decision which your Lordships reached at an
<col>44</col>
earlier stage, yet it is an advantage that he should have stated his views besides giving us the reasons which might induce him to withdraw his Amendment. As I have said before, we concur generally with the proposition laid down by my noble friend, but there are certain omissions in the clause as he proposes it which in our opinion would have to be dealt with by regulations. My noble friend explicitly stated, although I do not quite follow his reason for doing so, that he made no provision with regard either to the sales of untenanted land or with regard to sales of particular holdings which are not declared to be estates, and then in his provisions, as I see them here, nothing is said which covers future agreements of any kind, and nothing is said with regard to pending sales of land to the Congested Districts Board. My noble friend by his subsection (8) allows for some apportionment of advances to the Congested Districts Board, but one assumes that that only applies to future sales and not to pending sales.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00204"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> called the noble Earl's attention to the wording of subsection (1).</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00205"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I see my noble friend means to cover everything by the words "whether in pursuance of pending or future purchase agreements, or in respect of sales to the Land Commission." But my point was that although he laid down these rules for the various registers, his detailed provisions said nothing about the sales to the Land Commission. Now it is, as I said, unquestionably the case that as my Amendment, with the addition moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, has been passed, this Amendment becomes, I should think it is not too much to say, altogether out of order. But there is one point with regard to the provision made by the noble Viscount to which I ought to draw attention, and indeed I ought to have drawn attention to it at the time. The noble Viscount says that so far as is reasonably practicable priority should be maintained. My Lords, what is there to make it impracticable? The result might surely be that precise priority might have to be maintained without any reference to the different classes of which we spoke. What I think the noble Viscount meant was, not so far as is practicable, but so far as was thought
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0029"/>
<col>45</col>
reasonable under the arrangements which had been made. You cannot say it is impracticable merely because you desire to do things in a different way, and unless noble Lords intend to sacrifice our various classes, carrying out the different priorities <i>inter se</i>, if they mean to take a single list and make priority depend on that, that will as I have pointed out before, altogether upset the arrangements for the various methods of advances by cash alone, and by stock, and by stock and cash together.<lb/>
Our view is that the object being to get rid of this block, you must, although you can indicate the general lines on which you wish to proceed, allow a certain latitude to the Estates Commissioners. If you do not you will find yourselves in the position which was pointed out very truly by my noble friend as likely to happen, that a number of pending agreements will be held up because some other pending agreement, which has a technical priority over them, on account of some question of title or some matter of the kind cannot be immediately settled; and if you are going; to make a fetish of priority you will positively find that there are people whose affairs are quite ready to be concluded and yet who are technically prevented from coming to a conclusion by the fact that some gentleman ahead of them has not been able to establish a question of title. That, I am sure, is not at all what your Lordships mean by desiring to maintain priority, and we must be careful not to tie the Estates Commissioners down too closely. I quite understand what is in the minds of noble Lords opposite on this matter of priority, and we do not differ from their view. In all these matters, first come first served is a reasonable general view. The man who makes up his mind to sell clearly ought to have an advantage over the man who has not made up his mind. But, of course, this must all be subject to the very peculiar financial considerations under which we find ourselves, and also subject to subsidiary causes of delay which may have the effect of making a particular case which has been entered for sale at quite an early date drag on, as I am afraid some have dragged on, for quite a lengthy period. I need not add anything further. I have expressed on behalf of the Government a general agreement with my noble friend's Amendment, and I can assure him if his Amendment should be withdrawn
<col>46</col>
and it is to become a subject of regulation, that the general outlines of his scheme will certainly be embodied, although with some modifications and additions to which I do not think he would be likely to object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00206"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: After the statement the noble Earl has just made to the House I cannot help thinking that my noble friend on the Back Benches will be well advised not to press his Amendment. There really have been two different proposals before the House His Majesty's Government desire that this question of priority should be dealt with by regulations issued by the Lord Lieutenant. My noble friend on the Back Benches desires, on the contrary, that the question should be dealt with within the four corners of this Bill. I am bound to say, speaking generally, that it does seem to me that the subject-matter of my noble friend's Amendment can be more conveniently dealt with by regulations than within the strict clause of an Act of Parliament. It does seem to me to be necessary that there should be some power of adapting the rules to varying circumstances and of varying these regulations from time to time, and that we require something not quite so stereotyped as the clause of an Act of Parliament. But be that as it may, the House has really decided in favour of dealing with the matter by regulations, because we accepted, with an Amendment, the proposal of the noble Earl opposite. The proposal submitted by my noble friend on the Back Benches is one to which he has evidently given very close and attentive consideration, and I was extremely glad to hear from the noble Earl that when these regulations come to be drafted the general outline of my noble friend's proposal is likely to be followed, because the Amendment of my noble friend really does seem to me to be in accordance with what I conceive is the policy of noble Lords from Ireland who sit behind me. Let me say this one word more before I sit down. Nothing has been further from my thoughts at any rate than that we should endeavour to fetter the Estates Commissioners by a hard-and-fast application of the rule that he who comes first must in any circumstances be first served. It is quite obvious that a certain amount of elasticity must be given as between the different classes of applicants under this part of the Bill; and all that we
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0030"/>
<col>47</col>
care for is that in a general way the principle should be accepted by His Majesty's Government that so far as the circumstances permit, and as between the different classes of applicants, priority should be given to those who make their application first. That is the simple general principle, and if, as I hope, that principle is applied in the regulations which will be framed under this part of the Bill, I, for one, should be entirely content.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00207"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he assumed there were regulations in existence at present. There were regulations at the time of the late Government although they were modified after the change of Government; and he ventured to suggest, as had been done by his noble and learned friend already, that the Government themselves should embody in a schedule the regulations they were prepared in this first instance to submit to Parliament. That would not in the least fetter their power of changing, varying and adding to them, and would combine the advantage of letting their Lordships see in an Act of Parliament what was suggested.</p>

It would be very difficult for the Estates Commissioners, without having the Bill before them in its final form, to give advice to the Irish Office as to the form which the regulations under the Bill ought to take; but I will ask my right hon. friend whether it is possible&#x2014;I cannot say that it will be&#x2014;to submit any general heads of proposed regulations before the last stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00212"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved the insertion of a clause in relation to applications under subsection (1) of the Act of 1903, to provide that the Land Commissioners, if they had reason for doubting if a holding offered sufficient security for
<col>48</col>
an advance, might make inquiry and declare that the provision of the subsection should not apply. He did not yield to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, in his desire to keep the zone system intact. The zone system was, in his opinion, free from the complaint made against it that it enhanced the selling price of property. In his opinion it had proved most effective in bringing landlord and tenant together for the purpose of purchase. It was because he was so-jealous of the reputation of the zone system and so anxious to remove from it every possibility of hardship that he ventured once again to appeal to their Lordships' sense of justice in the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00213">When the Estates Commissioners began their work, at a very early stage of their operations a proposal was made to them for the sale of a property under an agreement between landlord and tenant. The same property had also been proposed for sale under the earlier Land Purchase Acts, an agreement having been come to between the landlord and the tenants. Under the system then in force the Commissioners deputed an inspector to report on the property. The amount claimed was, he thought, &#x00A3;5,000, and the inspector reported that it was not security for more than &#x00A3;4,000. These were approximate figures. When the Act of 1903 came into force the Estates Commissioners saw that if they were bound to comply with all applications, the zone system could be turned into an instrument of fraud on the public Treasury, and for five years they acted in the belief that it was competent to them to decline to declare that a particular property should be taken to be an estate in the language of the Act until they were satisfied that the property was security for the amount they advanced upon it. But their jurisdiction in that respect had been called in question and the Court of Appeal had ruled that the Commissioners were not competent to withhold their assent to the property being declared an estate and were bound to make the advance. During the time the Estates Commissioners maintained that they had that power, assaults on the Treasury of the description he had mentioned had been rare in Ireland, but if things continued as they were now he himself could place no limit to the number of unconscionable assaults there might be perpetrated on the public funds; and he ventured to ask their
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0031"/>
<col>49</col>
Lordships to take precautions to prevent the zone system being made the instrument of such attacks upon the public Treasury. He thought his Amendment would have that effect. He was of opinion that it was demoralising to the country and unfair to the Treasury that such bargains as he had indicated should be possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00214">There was another reason for enabling the Estates Commissioners to inquire into bargains which came within the zones, and that was where after the judicial rent was fixed the holding was permanently deteriorated owing to physical causes beyond the control of the tenant, It was quite possible now for a landlord and a tenant to come to an agreement for the sale of a property which had greatly deteriorated since the judicial rents were fixed, which was the basis of the zone system; an estate might be partly destroyed by a bog-slide and have become of less value than it was when the judicial rent was fixed. He was one of those who thought that the Government had conferred on Ireland remarkable benefits by the Land Purchase Act of 1903, and no temptation should be placed in the way of any parties to abuse those benefits.</p>

<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) that the judicial rent was fixed after the passing of the Act of 1903 by agreement or consent and not after judicial inquiry in court, and that there are reasons for doubting that holding is sufficient security for the advance;</li>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00218"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member>, in opposing the Amendment, said he did not wish to repeat
<col>50</col>
what he was afraid he had already said <i>ad nauseam</i>, that under the existing law if any advantage had been taken of a tenant he had the right to have the agreement set aside, and while that was so it was beating the air to talk of fraud and oppression and injustice that never had been established. There was no ground for saying that rents fixed by agreement out of Court had been excessive, or that they would not stand examination perfectly satisfactorily side by side with agreements made in Court. He had heard the Land Courts called by litigants "the Reduction Courts." Any one who knew the condition of things in Ireland knew perfectly well that the idea of a landlord coercing his tenant, the tenant being backed up and supported by public opinion as he was, into making an agreement adverse to the tenant's interests was a purely imaginary one. But why select 1903? The suggestion he supposed was that after the passing of the Land Act rents were fixed with a view to purchase under the Act of 1903.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00219"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the obvious reason was that there was no zone system before 1903.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00220"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> asked why if it was a genuine and real transaction it should not be done; the law provided a remedy in the case of a sham one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00221"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said his point was that there was collusion between the landlord and tenant. That point the noble and learned Lord was evading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00222"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said it was beating the air to speak of collusion which had not been proved. From the year 1888 till the present day he did not think there had been five cases in Ireland of agreements being set aside on the ground of collusion. The new clause would enable the Commissioners to take certain steps if they were satisfied that since the judicial rent was fixed the holding had permanently deteriorated owing to physical causes beyond the control of the tenant. In all the annals of the Estates Commissioners could they produce ten cases where a holding had substantially deteriorated in value since the fixing of the judicial rent? He thought it was rather too much to ask their Lordships to legislate for the circumstances which were not proved to have
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0032"/>
<col>51</col>
arisen simply on the suggestion that they might occur, and to set aside an existing system which had worked extremely well and but for which the vast majority of the agreements entered into would never have been effected at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00223"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> pointed out that Section 8 of the Act of 1881 dealt with the very thing with which the noble Lord sought to deal in his proposed new clause. He thought that nobody who had any experience of an Irish tenant would suggest for a moment that he was a man who would be likely to make a bargain which would be to his own detriment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00224"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> did not think that the question of zones had the great importance that was sometimes ascribed to it, because he was satisfied that the cases in which there had been any sort of abuse were extremely few. At the same time the arguments of his noble friend were extremely forcible when he brought forward such a case as he did, and even if one case of collusion only was proved he thought it deserved notice and that their Lordships should see that some safeguard was provided. He thought, however, that his noble friend's Amendment went too far. Everybody who was familiar with land purchase in Ireland was aware that in many cases agreements had been entered into after the passing of the Act of 1903 merely for the purpose of getting within the zone, cases where there was no manner of suspicion that any collusion was intended. He was perfectly well aware that many vendors in Ireland did take that course and it was a perfectly legitimate one, but whether wise or not was another matter. He thought, therefore, that the Amendment went a little too far in ruling out all judicial rents fixed by agreement since the passing of the Act of 1903, and he suggested that words should be introduced limiting the clause to cases where the rent had been raised. He suggested, after the words "judicial inquiry in Court," the insertion of the words "and such agreement did not include an increase of Tent." If the noble Lord consented to that he would support him if he went to a Division.</p>

<col>52</col>
glad, therefore, that my noble friend behind me alluded to it as he did in his powerful speech. The argument that I understand is used against any interference with the zones is that they are so valuable a part of the Act of 1903 that they ought not to be touched in any way. The question of collusion between a landlord and tenant, and the possibility of it, is one which cannot be set aside. It is all very well to say that you cannot produce a great number of cases. It is the mere fact that you cannot produce them which makes the situation a serious one. If you have no means of making the inquiry you clearly cannot produce the necessary <i>data</i>. I do not suppose there is either a landlord or a tenant in Ireland&#x2014;and I am willing for the sake of noble Lords opposite to add in England&#x2014;who cares a brass farthing whether the State is properly secured or not, and naturally in entering into an agreement of that kind people try to get the best terms they can for themselves. The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, used on a former Amendment a singular argument with regard to this question of collusion. He said that as long as there was a reduction in the rent it did not matter how it was arrived at and that the State security would not be impaired. That all depends on whether the rent was paid. If it was not paid, the mere fact that a rent was fixed at a certain amount is entirely irrelevant on this question of security. That, of course, applies in particular to the question of arrears, but my noble friend in his Amendment, in subsection (2), makes the question of arrears one into which the Estates Commissioners should have power to inquire, and I therefore think I am not wrong in alluding to it. We consider, I confess, that it is a serious matter to place the Exchequer entirely at the mercy of what people entering into these transactions may choose to do. As time goes on people get cleverer and cleverer in such matters in devising means. In a sense one does not blame them as long as they are acting within the law. But as years go on, and more and more agreements are made, there will be a tendency, it seems only natural to think, to attempt evasions, and although it seems clear that my noble friend has no chance of carrying his Amendment I feel bound to say that we regard with no little apprehension the absolute disappearance from the Bill of any safeguard in respect of these evasions.</membercontribution></p>

He said the whole of the clause limited the operation of Section 1 (4) of the Act of 1903 whereby the Land Commission was empowered to advance to one purchaser a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;7,000. Clause 14 was retrogressive and even went
<col>54</col>
behind Section 2 of the Act of 1888, which permitted an advance to one purchaser up to a limit of &#x00A3;5,000 provided that the holding to be purchased was situated on the estate of the same landlord. It would be very hard under the clause on a tenant of a large holding, who, perhaps, for family reasons had to live away from his particular holding, that he should be debarred from obtaining the necessary advance over &#x00A3;3,000 to purchase his holding. Was that because the Government wished to break up the strong yeoman farmer class in Ireland, the men who were able to farm their land with their own capital and who occupied a strong and respectable position in the community?</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00233"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl's Amendment seems to me not entirely to carry out what he desires, because the effect of omitting subsection (2) is simply further to limit the class of persons to whom advances can be sanctioned. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) forbids the making of an advance unless the tenant resides on the holding, or unless he lives on a holding and wishes to buy a holding ordinarily used with that on which the tenant resides. Subsection (2) enlarges the definition of residence, and if it is omitted the power will be entirely confined to persons under paragraph (<i>a</i>). I should like to point out another curious effect which arises from the clause as it stands; that is, in respect of the word "or" in line 26 [the "or" connecting paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>)], inserted, I think, on the motion of a noble Lord opposite at the last stage. The effect of that is that there is a normal limit of advance of &#x00A3;3,000, and where the Land Commission think that a larger amount, not exceeding &#x00A3;5,000, may properly be sanctioned, they can do it; but owing to the use of the word "or" there is a further class of persons&#x2014;namely, tenants who reside on a holding, or near&#x2014;who can receive an advance of an absolutely unlimited amount. There is nothing to prevent a million of money being advanced under subsection (<i>a</i>); therefore I think it will be necessary, if noble Lords desire to put the clause in a form to carry out what I take it they mean, although it has been altered from our view,

<col>56</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00242">His first Amendment, said the noble Lord, was merely a transposition of the last proviso in paragraph (<i>d</i>) of the clause as it stood. He had taken the liberty of transposing the clause of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, from that part of the clause in which it at present stood and had placed it in the situation from which the subclause had been removed. He did that with the object of making room, as it were, for his proposal, which was at the bottom of the page. In the first Amendment, so far as he could judge, nothing was done that was not already in the Bill or introduced into it on the last occasion when the measure was before their Lordships. The second proposal was to insert in paragraph (<i>c</i>) the words "and had been evicted before the commencement of this Act for non-payment of rent." He saw that the same proposal was made by the noble Earl, Lord Wicklow, and the object of it was to prevent tenants evicted after the passing of that Act from claiming reinstatement as evicted tenants. It was, in his opinion, the intention of the Act of 1903 that tenants evicted after the date of the passing of that Act should not be able to claim the privileges of an evicted tenant of restoration to their holding. But that clause of the Act was so interpreted as to confer upon tenants evicted after the passing of the Act of 1903 the privilege of evicted tenants, and was said to endow them with a claim for reinstatement. He thought it was desirable that an end should be put to this sort of claim and he therefore made his proposal. It would be in their Lordships' recollection that the proposal which he now made was already incorporated in the Evicted Tenants Act which their Lordships has-passed. His last proposal, which he presumed he might mention at this time, was to delete paragraph (<i>d</i>) and to insert a new paragraph (<i>e</i>), as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Any person to whom, in the opinion of the Land Commission, an advance ought to be made for the purchase of mansions, demesne lands, special grounds, plantations, and other such land, as, in the opinion of the Land Commission, is not suitable for distribution to persons of the preceding classes."</quote>
That was to give the Land Commission the power of selling demesnes, mansions, and gardens which had been sold by the proprietor, and to save them from the necessity of dividing the land among the neighbouring tenants.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00244"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he did not recognise at all that the Amendment was of the harmless character that the noble Lord had suggested. The provision about the son of the proprietor of the holding was part of the Bill as it originally stood and was deliberately struck out. It was provided by Clause 15 that three classes of persons were first to be considered&#x2014;proprietors of holdings, persons who had surrendered their holdings, and evicted tenants. He would have a word to say later about the definition of an evicted tenant. It was after that that landless men and the sons of tenants, if they came in at all, came in under paragraph (<i>d</i>) after all the requirements of the preceding classes had been adequately provided for. What the noble Lord attempted to do was to restore the deleted subsection (<i>d</i>) into its original place in the Bill. That was to smash up altogether the Amendment which had been made. It was not merely to alter procedure but to smash the Amendment thoroughly. They had been told that the function of the Report stage was sandpapering. This appeared to him to be using the pickaxe rather than sandpaper. It restored what was knocked out on Second Reading, and he would suggest to the noble Lord that, as there must be some finality in these proceedings, there was no use in moving again upon Report things that had been fully debated in Committee. How did the matter stand? At present, according to the Bill, the three classes he had mentioned were entitled to have parcels of land allotted to them, and then, after their requirements had been provided for, any surplus lands might be given to any person to whom, in the opinion of the Land Commission, an advance ought to be made. It might be that landless men would come in under paragraph (<i>d</i>), but, as he had said, only after the requirements of the other classes had been fully met. The noble Lord defeated all that by putting in an earlier paragraph which would give all landless men an opportunity of getting advances, even in priority to those persons who had surrendered their holdings for
<col>58</col>
the purpose of relieving congestion. As to the evicted tenants question he hardly thought that necessary, because it was clear, under the Act of 1903, that it was only intended to apply to persons who had been tenants twenty-four years before the passing of the Act and were not tenants at the date of purchase. He did not know where it had been decided that men who were evicted after the passing of the Act of 1903 were entitled to be treated as evicted tenants.</p>

They have chosen to interpret that Act in a way obviously never intended, because the phrases are phrases that were put into the Acts of 1896, 1903, and 1907. It was obviously intended that no person should be entitled to be reinstated as an evicted tenant unless he had been in possession of land twenty-five years before the passing of the Act of 1903 and was evicted before the passing of that Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00251"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: I think you will find it laid down in Mr. Cherry's book that tenants evicted after the passing of the Act of 1903 were held to

be entitled to, and as a matter of fact were granted, the privileges of evicted tenants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00252"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he did not know how soon Mr. Cherry might be translated to a place where his decisions would have judicial weight, but he (Lord Atkinson) did not apprehend that his statement in the notes to his Act had any authority beyond the right hon. gentleman's own opinion. At all events, it was no reason whatever for giving the privileges of evicted tenants to men who had occupied up till 1908 and been then evicted. Everybody knew that the evicted tenants clauses were introduced to restore the original position in the case of men who were described as the wounded soldiers of the campaign which began in 1879 and who left their homes because they could not pay and would not pay, because they were told not to pay. It was never intended to apply to men who had occupied holdings which were at present held by them, and which they had continued to occupy up till the Act of 1908. If the noble Lord would confine his Amendment to persons who were evicted for non-payment of rent before the passing of the Act of 1903, he (Lord Atkinson) would entirely agree with him. He never could understand what particular virtue became concentrated in a tenant the moment he refused or was unable to pay rent. The noblest work of God, Pope said, was an honest man. According to the recent dispensation, the noblest work of Cod was a tenant who would not pay his rent; everybody's privileges must be invaded to restore him to the position from which he had fallen. The Amendment was, he thought, entirely misconceived. It must be considered with the Amendment of the noble Lord which attempted to deal with the surplus lands that were not required and to satisfy the claims of proprietors, persons who had surrendered, and evicted tenants. He could not see that the Amendment was in any way an improvement on the clause as it stood. It re-opened the entire matter and involved the rediscussion of all those Amendments that they discussed fully on the occasion of the Committee stage. If ever a question was <i>chose jug&#x00E9;e</i> it was the question of the landless man.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00253"><sup>*</sup><member> THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: As regards the first Amendment of my noble friend behind me (Lord MacDonnell) it doubtless has the effect which the noble and learned
<col>60</col>
Lord opposite describes of restoring to the son of a tenant or proprietor of the holding a certain priority which had been removed by the Amendment adopted in Committee. I see no object in again arguing that point, but, from some points of view, the more general provisions contained in the first part of Lord Atkinson's subsection is to my mind more satisfactory than the proposition of my noble friend behind me, because it does, at any rate, leave the general discussion to the Estates Commissioners after certain persons have been provided for, and it would even allow the admission of these later evicted tenants of whom the noble and learned Lord has no very high opinion.<lb/>
I may also mention that we adhere to our objection that the single son of the same tenant should be favoured. In the clause as it now stands there is a somewhat curious result following from that. Parents are divided into two classes. If the parent's holding exceeds &#x00A3;30 in value, no son of his can come within the section. If he has more than one son, only one can come in; but, if he is a landless man himself, any number of his sons apparently can be introduced. The effect of that is surely anomalous. I remember when I was in Ireland receiving a petition to have a fine remitted. One of the grounds was that the culprit had "a long weak family of thirteen, all of them daughters only the two third youngest." Therefore as your Lordships will see from that rather enigmatical phrase, there were two sons, and if, in addition to having that large quiver full of children, the man was also a landless man these two third youngest sons could have received, under the clause as it stands, holdings from the Estates Commissioners.<lb/>
As to the second Amendment, I should offer no objection to the insertion of the words proposed by my noble friend behind me; but as regards the third Amendment that, as I say, appears to us to be not so convenient in form as paragraph (<i>d</i>) as it stands. There is one point to which I should like to draw my noble friend's attention. He says after mansions, demesne lands, and so on "other such land as in the opinion of the Land Commission is not suitable to persons of the preceding classes." That would prevent any agricultural land being sold with a mansion, which is not, I am sure, at all what my
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0037"/>

He wished further to add words not on the Paper, "and had made application for reinstatement before the first clay of May, 1907." The object of his Amendment was not quite what Lord MacDonnell had stated it to be. It seemed to him that, under the clause as at present worded, the only qualification necessary for an applicant to obtain a holding would be the ability to prove that during twenty-five years preceding the Act of 1903 he had been in possession of a holding of some kind. A ridiculous state of things might result from that. A man might have sold his holding for a considerable sum of money during any of those twenty-five years and then might have gone abroad or might have spent that money in any of the numerous ways in which it was possible to spend money. He could then go back to Ireland in a practically destitute condition, go to the Estates Commissioners and say "You are obliged to provide me with a new holding. Will you kindly do so?" How could the Estates Commissioners get out of it? By his Amendment the operation of the clause would be limited entirely to tenants who had really been evicted; and the addition of the words which he suggested, which were not on the printed Paper, would restrict the clause and, at the same time, give it the same application as that which their Lordships allowed in the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907. No tenant could claim the benefit of that Act unless he had made a claim for reinstatement before the first day of May, 1907, and it seemed desirable

It is important, I think, to point out a fact which might not, at a cursory reading of the Amendment, be quite clear. As my Amendment is placed on the Paper it would not apply to pending
<col>64</col>
agreements. It says "The Land Commission, on the application, in the prescribed manner, of any landlord who is desirous of selling estate under the Land Purchase Acts." That closes the door to the large number of &#x00A3;53,000,000 of pending agreements. That, I think, would, in itself, be an unfortunate result. But, on the other hand&#x2014;and I think in this your Lordships will agree&#x2014;it is a somewhat strong measure to re-open a contract which has been arrived at between landlord and tenant and to withdraw a certain portion of land after an agreement has been made between landlord and tenant that the whole of the holding should be the subject of sale and purchase. It really is a question of whether the undoubted advantage of applying from a social point of view this provision to pending agreements is so great as to justify what I think we must all admit is a serious departure from our ordinary custom in the way of allowing a Court to amend an agreement which has been actually arrived at between two different parties. Feeling that that was a somewhat serious matter to undertake we have drawn the Amendment in the way I have described. As regards the Amendment of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Earl Cadogan), it would, I suppose, include pending agreements. I take it that the words, "Where any land is sold to the occupying tenant," would entitle the Estates Commissioners to take the steps for which he provides, but for the purpose of obtaining the opinion of your Lordships' House as to which of the two courses is the most desirable I will move my own Amendment, and hear what the noble Earl has to say.</membercontribution></p>

said he ought to explain why he had allowed his original Amendment to remain on the Paper. He had no opportunity of seeing his noble friend and conferring with him on the matter, and perhaps, after all, it was better that the two plans should be seen side by side. The speech which the noble Earl had just made in support of his Amendment would be a somewhat memorable one, because he had explained that the reasons why His Majesty's Government preferred their arrangement was that they were very strongly opposed to the breaking of contracts. He hoped the noble Earl's statement would be duly registered in the annals of the House, and he thought that probably the page on which it was printed would be frequently referred to in their future debates. Of course, under the circumstances he would withdraw his new subsection.</p>

He desired to know if the noble Earl would make a small addition to his new subsection by inserting, after "planting trees or preserving woods or plantations," the words "or growing timber." Those words had been represented to him as being necessary, and he did not suppose there could be any objection to them.</p>

<col>66</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00278"><member>EARL CADOGAN</member> said there was one question to which he would be glad to have an answer. It was as to why the word "full" was inserted before "compensation" in the subsection moved by the noble Earl. In his (Earl Cadogan's) original Amendment he stated, "the Land Commission may make an order vesting such portion in the vendor of the estate upon such terms as to compensation, and otherwise as may be agreed upon." The noble Earl's subsection, however, provided that the Land Commission "may authorise the landlord to resume that portion upon such terms as may be approved of by the Land Commission, including full compensation to the tenant." There was no reason to believe that there was any special significance in the use of the word "full," but he would venture to ask why it was inserted at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00279"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I believe the words "full compensation" are frequently used in this connection and that there are various precedents for them. The words have been used in more than one of the Irish Land Acts&#x2014;in the Act of 1881 and others. The word "full" Has no specially offensive sense attaching to it. My noble friend has been so good as to withdraw his Amendment, but he did not specifically deal with the point which I have raised and perhaps some other noble Lord will give the opinion of the House upon it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00283"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> hoped the word "full" would not be deleted. If an occupying tenant had agreed to buy land, and the landlord desired to reserve a portion of the land, the tenant was to get "full" compensation, whatever that might mean. He hoped the word "full" would be preserved, as it would have a reflex-action on the compensation ion which was to be paid to the landlord under the compulsory clauses when land was taken from him.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00285"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINEORD</member> moved to amend Clause 18, subsection (1)&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00286"><b>18.</b>&#x2014;(1) In subsection (51 of section six of the Act of 1903 (which defines a congested estate) "ten pounds" shall be substituted for "five pounds."

<col>67</col>
by omitting the words "In subsection (5) of section six of the Act of 1903," and inserting the words "From subsection (4) of section six of the Act of 1903 the words ' with the consent of the owner' shall be omitted, and in subsection (5) of the same section and Act." He said he was anxious to put himself right in connection with this Amendment. The noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Atkinson, had stated that it was improper on the Report stage to bring up a matter which had been disposed of in Committee. But he himself was under the impression that it was open to members of their Lordships' House to bring up on Report for the further consideration of their Lordships any matter, whether it had been rejected in Committee or not. If he were wrong in that belief, he would be glad to be corrected, because his Amendment was a request that their Lordships would reconsider a decision they had come to on the Committee stage. It was a matter to which he attached the very greatest importance, and in the interests of the relief of congestion in Ireland he thought it desirable that he should again press his views on the notice of the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00287">When the Bill which became the Act of 1903 reached their Lordships' House, it contained no mention of the consent of the owner being requisite to the certificate which Section 6 of the Act of 1903 required from the Estates Commissioners before an estate could be treated as congested. The whole matter was one of price, and subsequently of expenditure in improving the congested estate. As their Lordships knew, the zone did not apply to congested estates. If the Congested Districts Board entered into negotiations for the purchase of an estate, the zones had no application. Section 6 of the Act of 1903 provided that if the Estates Commissioners submitted to the Lord Lieutenant a certificate stating that, in their opinion, it was desirable that a certain estate for which they were in treaty should be dealt with as congested, the acceptance of that certificate by the Lord Lieutenant brought the negotiations under that section of the Act of 1903 which exempted the negotiations from the operation of the zones, and enabled the Estates Commissioners to expend money in improving the estate. The effect of introducing the words "with the consent of the owner," which was done in their Lordships' House, had been that practically no certificates had been submitted to the
<col>68</col>
Lord Lieutenant, and that all attempts to relieve congestion outside the scheduled districts had been neutralised. The Estates Commissioners, in their last Report, stated that in only twenty cases were they able to relieve congestion under the Act, and they put their failure down to the presence in the section of these words. It was certain that, if these words were retained in the section, congestion outside the scheduled districts would remain as much unrelieved in the future as it had been in the past.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00288">What objection was there from the vendor's or the landlord's point of view to agreeing to this Amendment? It would not limit the freedom of contract or the freedom of sale. It would not compel landlords to sell or to accept a price which they were unwilling to agree to. What it would do was to exclude from the transaction all inferences to be drawn from the zones and to enable the Lord Lieutenant to consent to the expenditure of public money on the improvement of the estate. It might be that a landlord selling a congested estate would not be able to get from the Estates Commissioners as high a price as he might get from his tenants if he could induce them to buy within the zones. But he was not prevented by the deletion of the words from the section from selling to his tenants within the zones. As the law at present stood it was possible in a congested district for a landlord to sell to his tenants within the zones, and for the transaction to pass through. But when he proposed to sell to the Estates Commissioners, then the removal of these words would enable the Estates Commissioners, when they had bought from him at a price he was willing to take, to spend money on the estate and bring it into a good condition. At the present time they were unable to do that. If their Lordships decided to retain these words in the section they would prevent negotiations between the Estates Commissioners and the owners of congested holdings, and would make it impossible to relieve congestion outside the scheduled areas.</p>

him by saying he could not see that any possible harm could be done to a landlord through having his estate declared a congested estate and asking what objection there could be from the landlord's point of view. The noble Lord told them that the Congested Districts Board had received refusals from many landlords to have their estates declared congested estates. That being the case it was quite clear that they had an objection, and it was quite possible to conceive it was a well-founded one he trusted that their Lordships would not consent to the omission of these words, but would adhere to the course which they pursued in Committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00291"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> rather agreed with the noble Lord opposite. He did not see what protection the words "with the consent of the owner" afforded to the landlord. If the landlord wished to sell direct to his tenants the zones applied. If he wished to sell to the Congested Districts Board he had nothing whatever to do with the zones. The operation of the zones, if they acted at all, would be between the Estates Commissioners, who became the owners of the congested estate, and the sales from them to the tenants. The great advantage, as he understood, of having an estate defined as a congested estate was that the Estates Commissioners might sell to the tenants, although they thereby suffered a loss. He never could understand what protection these words gave to the landlord, because the landlord need not deal with the Estates Commissioners unless he liked. The definition</p>

It did not apply to dealings between him and his tenantry at all. His noble friend Lord Clonbrock had said that the best proof that these words were required was furnished by the fact that landlords in many cases had refused to allow their estates to be treated as congested estates. One did not know what was the reason they gave for their opposition, but it appeared to him, as far as he had been able to follow it, that they gained nothing by the retention of these words, and would lose nothing by their deletion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00293"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> thought that exaggerated importance was attached to the matter. One would almost have thought that in putting in words to say that the consent of the landlord should be necessary they were dealing with the preamble to a compulsory purchase clause. As a matter of fact, it was not that at all. As Lord MacDonnell had explained on a previous occasion, it had reference purely to voluntary purchase and voluntary agreements. The landlord would not be a bit more compelled to sell if the Amendment were adopted than he was before. This was a preamble enabling a preliminary step to be taken which might be followed out by an agreement between parties.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00296">Amendment negatived accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00297"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> moved the omission of the words:&#x2014;"(1) In subsection (5) of section six of the Act of 1903 (which defines a congested estate), 'ten pounds' shall be, substituted for 'five pounds.'" He said that if the Amendment were carried, of course the condition of things would revert to what it was under the Act of 1903. He confessed he moved the Amendment with some trepidation because he knew he should expose himself to the righteous indignation of the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell, and to the wrath of the ghosts of the Devon Commission which sat seventy-five years ago. But he consoled himself with thinking that if he had their disapproval he ought at any rate to secure the approval of members of their Lordships' House on both sides, and also that of those who were members of the House of Commons on both sides in 1903. He found on reference to the debates that this clause was passed without any suggestion that the conditions which described a congested estate should be in any way enlarged. The definition of what constituted a congested estate given in the fifth subsection of Section 6 of the Act of 1903 was the definition given by the Government of that day and accepted by all parties as a good definition of congestion; and if they attempted to increase and extend that definition from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;10, they rendered the problem very much more difficult to solve. Lord MacDonnell would say that was not a reason for not attempting to solve it, but the fact remained that it made the problem much more complicated and difficult. He pointed out some time ago that a congested holding did not always mean that the people on it were extremely poor. His noble and learned friend had described them as hungry, wretched-looking people who were pleading at the bar of their Lordships' House. But the fact that people were on congested holdings did not at all mean that
<col>72</col>
they were in that condition. On the contrary, heaps of them had a great deal of money. They took land for grass farms, and in many cases they got employment as labourers. Their Lordships must remember also that the whole problem had been much changed through the granting of old age pensions, which had made an immense difference to the comfort of the people in the West of Ireland. His chief reason for suggesting that this change was not necessary was that the problem would become so great as to be almost insoluble without another Act of Parliament to settle it. He suggested that His Majesty's Government would do well to confine themselves first of all to relieving the most pressing cases of necessity, and after that had been successfully done they could turn their attention if necessary to the larger problem.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00299"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that there was no longer room for indignation in his mind, which was oppressed with sorrow that a noble Lord coming from one of the most distressed parts of Ireland should find a reason for refusing to relieve that distress in the hardness of the task. Instead of raising the holdings from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;10, the noble Lord would prefer to leave the value at &#x00A3;5 and let the people eke out a miserable existence on old age pensions and the wages of labour. That was not the spirit in which their Lordships as a whole approached this question, and it was not the spirit in which the problem could be solved. When the noble Lord referred to &#x00A3;5 as being the limit which was preserved in the Act of 1903, he failed to remember that some time before that, in the Act of 1891, the limit of &#x00A3;20 was incorporated by the Legislature. Those who had looked through the evidence of the Dudley Commission 
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0043"/>
<col>73</col>
must have been struck with the unanimity of feeling which prevailed, wherever the Commission took evidence, that &#x00A3;10 was the lowest valuation for a holding from which a family could derive a decent subsistence. There was a large mass of evidence to show that &#x00A3;15 was a more reasonable figure, while many people were in favour of &#x00A3;12 10<i>s</i>., and nobody proposed anything less than &#x00A3;10. He thought it would be a waste of time to argue that the question of congestion in the West of Ireland, or in any part of Ireland, could be remedied if the House entertained a proposal which would keep people on a holding of &#x00A3;5 valuation, and bid them look for a means of eking out the subsistence they wore now obtaining through old age pensions and migratory labour. He was sorry that a proposal of this description should have emanated from a member of their Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00300"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member> differed from the noble Lord opposite. He did not believe anybody lived on the proceeds of a holding of &#x00A3;10 valuation, and in a great many cases those people were not in the poverty-stricken state that some noble Lords appeared to imagine. He knew one small tenant who lived on a holding of &#x00A3;7 valuation and paid him &#x00A3;90 a year for grass land. It was absolutely unnecessary to say that a man must starve in his holding, because these people did not live, as he had said, by their holdings alone.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00301"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord who has just sat down has drawn attention to the well-known fact that everybody who lives on a small holding is not necessarily a pauper, but I do not think any one who knows even the comparatively little that I do of the condition of things in the West of Ireland will deny that&#x2014;though undoubtedly to a somewhat decreasing extent owing in a large degree to the action of the Congested Districts Board&#x2014;there are vast numbers of persons who are living on the very edge of pauperism and eking out a miserable existence by various forms of casual labour. It seems to me that noble Lords go almost too far when they deny, as they seem to do, the existence of anything like a problem of congestion in the West of Ireland. Noble Lords say "No, no"; but that seems to be the point to which the arguments of some noble Lords opposite are directed. I must confess that to my mind the acceptance of the Amendment
<col>74</col>
must have a most serious effect on the operations for the relief of congestion as described by my noble friend behind me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00302"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am disposed to agree with the noble Lords who have pointed out that it by no means follows that the occupier of a holding under &#x00A3;10 valuation is necessarily in an uneconomic or miserable condition. I think it is within the knowledge of most noble Lords who are familiar with the congested districts of Ireland that there are many men with holdings of less than &#x00A3;10 valuation who have actually more land than they can properly cultivate. But in spite of that it does seem to me a very serious proposal to alter this &#x00A3;10 limit to one of &#x00A3;5, as proposed by my noble friend. The &#x00A3;10 limit is that insisted upon in the Report of the Dudley Commission, upon which this Bill is founded. We have, I think, to remember that what is proposed in this clause is not that it should be admitted that every holder below &#x00A3;10 is necessarily in such miserable circumstances as to require assistance at the hands of the Government; but that this is to be taken as a general definition as to what; ought to be considered in the eye of the law a congested district for the purposes of this Act. I cannot help feeling, as the noble Earl who leads the House has told us, that it would be a very serious modification for us to make in the first principle on which this Bill is founded, and I regret to tell my noble friend that, if he goes to a Division, I shall not be able to support him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00309"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> had given notice of an Amendment to add, "Provided that any person aggrieved by anything done by one Estates Commissioner shall be entitled to have the action of which he complains reconsidered by three Estates Commissioners, who shall make such order on the matter as they shall deem just, on the terms however, that the person so requiring the action of the aforesaid Estates Commission to be reconsidered shall be liable, should his complaint be held to be frivolous or unfounded, to pay to any person pecuniarily interested in the matter complained of, such costs, not exceeding &#x00A3;10 in amount, as the three Commissioners aforesaid may award."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00310">He said that Clause 24 enabled the Estates Commissioners to delegate all or any of their powers to any one of their number, and provided that anything done by any one or two of the Estates Commissioners in pursuance of any such delegation should be as valid and effectual as if it were done by all the Estates Commissioners. He did not wish to use extravagant language, but, considering
<col>76</col>
the powers conferred on the Estates Commissioners, that was a monstrous proposition. He quite saw, on the other hand, that there were many petty matters of detail in regard to which the procedure would be rather cumberous if it was required that they should be settled by two or more Commissioners. He thought it was impossible to define what should be done by one Commissioner and what should be done by more than one. Therefore he moved his Amendment, which he recommended to the consideration of their Lordships as providing a certain amount of guidance in the matter. Under his Amendment, if any person felt aggrieved by anything that was done by one Commissioner he would have the right to have the matter which be complained of reheard before three Commissioners sitting together. Lord Dunboyne had put down an Amendment to add after "three Estates Commissioners" the words "sitting together." He thanked the noble Lord for his suggestion, and he accepted it. He had provided for an abuse of the right conferred under his Amendment by providing that the Estates Commissioners might fix with costs, not exceeding &#x00A3;10, any person raising a frivolous or unfounded objection. His noble friend Lord Dunboyne had put down an Amendment to the effect that all ministerial acts relating to the details of the carrying out of any transactions might be performed by one Commissioner. The difficulty arose however, of defining what were details and what was a ministerial act, inasmuch as nineteen-twentieths of the work was administrative.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00312"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> thought that Clause 24 was extremely wide in its application. The Act of 1903 required all the Estates Commissioners to perform all the duties.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0045"/>
<col>77</col>
It did not make use of the words "sitting together," but the context showed the intention that it should be so. What took place was that one Commissioner sat alone to hear a case and make an order upon it, which was sent to another Commissioner, or the other two Commissioners, to be initialled. The order then passed as the order of the three. He believed an instance had occurred where a Commissioner who heard a case had actually been overruled by the two who did not hear it, and in consequence of their refusal to initial the order the matter fell through. He had placed on the Paper an Amendment that the powers of the Commissioners should be exercised by any two of them "sitting together," and he thought some such provision was essential to the proper conduct of their duties. He was glad those words had been accepted by his noble and learned friend.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00313"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> remarked that the position as regarded the proposed Amendments required consideration. He agreed almost entirely with Lord Atkinson, but thought that was not a convenient place to introduce the modification. Lord Dunboyne proposed to omit Clause 24 altogether and insert a new clause, and he thought Lord Atkinson's Amendment should be added at the end. He would like to ask what was the technical meaning of "sitting together." Was it contemplated that the Commissioners would sit together in a kind of judicial position? He did not believe that would be the way in which business was carried out, but it would be done in the manner most convenient for the despatch of work. He supposed that in nine cases out of ten they would exchange their views without technically sitting together, and finally conclude that they had come to a point where they could agree. Although the three Commissioners had not been sitting together their minds might have been working to the same object, and accomplishing the same result. Putting it shortly, he would be satisfied with the first part of the clause of his noble friend Lord Dunboyne, with the exception of the reference to the Commissioners sitting together. He was not sure about the proviso, but if his noble friend thought it desirable he had no objection to it; but then there came into consideration the difficulty pointed out by Lord Atkinson of differentiating in such a jurisdiction between a judicial and a ministerial act.
<col>78</col>
The vast majority of the work was ministerial if they chose so to regard it. It had the flavour of being judicial occasionally, but it was not easy to mark out clearly what was judicial and what was ministerial. He thought the Amendment of his noble and learned friend would come in with great force if Lord Dunboyne's proposal were taken, so that if one Commissioner made an order which was open to objection then any aggrieved person could, in the words of Lord Atkinson's Amendment, require the action to be heard again by the three Commissioners, but should his complaint be held to be frivolous or vexatious he would have to pay costs. He thought it would be wiser in the interests of the drafting of the Bill for Lord Dunboyne's Amendment to come first if that were the desire of the House, and for Lord Atkinson's Amendment to come in after.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00314"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> thought it would be a most dangerous thing to give to the Estates Commissioners the power of delegation which it was proposed to give. It might be that one of the Estates Commissioners took a particular view of his duties and another took another view, while the third differed from the other two. It was quite possible, if the delegation were carried out, to have a system which would differ according to the idiosyncrasy of the particular Commissioner who presided. There would be nothing like uniformity of procedure and serious inconvenience would arise. That, he thought, was a very great danger which their Lordships ought not to incur. He thought the Amendment of Lord Dunboyne, if the words "sitting together" were omitted, was the best solution which could be found if they altered the existing state of things at all. As things were conducted at present the Estates Commissioners did not always sit together. They did so sit when an important case was to be heard; but otherwise a great deal of their work was done by means of the circulation of papers. An opinion was expressed by one Commissioner, the next Commissioner initialed it if he agreed with it, and then it went on to the third. In that way business was conducted in an expeditious manner. When an important matter was to be decided all three Commissioners, when there, sat together. He thought the object should be to preserve that system as much as possible, and if any alteration was to be made so that the work done
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0046"/>
<col>79</col>
by two Commissioners was to carry the authority of all, that could be done by leaving out the words "sitting together." If those words were inserted an inconvenient limitation would be imposed upon the procedure of the Commissioners. He should prefer to omit the clause altogether and leave things as they were, when the opinion of the majority carried the day; but if anything had to be done, he should prefer the proposal of Lord Dunboyne with the omission of the words "sitting together."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00315"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think it is not entirely unreasonable if this power remains in the Bill to impose upon it certain limitations, but in our view the limitations proposed by the two noble Lords opposite are of such a character and would have such results that of the two we should prefer to see Clause 24 omitted altogether rather than to see it amended in the manner which noble Lords opposite propose. The effect of the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, would be that any person who considered himself aggrieved by anything done by an Estates Commissioner would be entitled to have the action of which he complained reconsidered by three Estates. Commissioners. If the noble and learned Lord's Amendment is to stand I think he would have to say "anything so done," because he cannot mean anything done anywhere by an Estates Commissioner in any capacity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00316"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: It is a proviso, of course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00317"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Anybody who considered himself aggrieved, however trivial the matter, if he were willing to risk a &#x00A3;10 note, as a great many litigious persons are, could cause this trivial matter to be considered by three Estates Commissioners sitting together as a tribunal. If anything of that kind were done it would be necessary to make the liability very much greater than the &#x00A3;10 proposed here, because the cost to the other party might be infinitely greater than &#x00A3;10 if he had to go to Dublin from the other end of Ireland in order to defend a case before the three Commissioners sitting together. Therefore we object to the phrase "sitting together," and very largely on the grounds which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, stated just now. Lord Dunboyne talked of a matter being settled
<col>80</col>
by a mere initial as though that involved some complete neglect of the subject-matter which had to be decided. The noble Lord knows very well that infinitely more important matters than the questions that come before the Estates Commissioners are settled every day by initials, and it does not follow because you write your initials on the back of a document that you have not given it the closest possible study and arrived at a very definite decision upon it. If all these trivial matters had to be decided by the three Commissioners seated side by side in an almost judicial manner I would very much rather not see the clause in at all. As regards the Amendment of Lord Dunboyne, I confess I do not know how you could distinguish between ministerial acts which could be done by one Commissioner and other acts which could not. I have no clear conception in my mind as to the distinction which would be drawn, and how in the event of somebody complaining that some decision had been arrived at by a Commissioner by which he, the complainant, considered himself aggrieved, what meaning in a Court of Law would attach to the word "ministerial" in this relation. For that reason I am afraid we cannot accept the noble Lord's Amendment. We do not take the same exception to the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord provided that it does not involve the sitting together of the three Commissioners, but we should, of course, greatly prefer to see Clause 24 stand as it is in the Bill as amended in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00318"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> thought a great many noble Lords behind him from Ireland would fall in with the view of the noble Earl and have the clause deleted altogether from the Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00320"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said he had never heard any argument why the Estates Commissioners might delegate any of their powers to any one or two of their number.

<image src="S5LV0004P0I0047"/>

Commissioners did not sit on a bench in one room as a judicial body. Their business had to be done in the way that all business was done. One man had to do one part of it and the other another part, and these schemes were brought from one to the other and initialled or not initialled as the case might be. For his own part he could not see the object of this clause at all, and he could fall in with the noble Earl's idea that the clause was much better out of the Bill. That would be much better than the Amendments that had been brought forward by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, and the noble Lord, Lord Dunboyne, and he hoped noble Lords from Ireland would fall in with this view, because it simplified matters very much and left the Estates Commissioners free to do their business in the way they thought best. He had never said a word against the Estates Commissioners and he hoped he never should. They had had a most difficult task to perform under most difficult conditions, and he could not see the object of this delegation clause.</p>

He said this was another of the paragraphs which their Lordships deleted from the Bill in Committee, and which he thought it his duty to ask their Lordships to reconsider. The effect of the clause as it stood would be that holdings would become consolidated into larger holdings, that publicans and money-lenders would buy up holdings that were offered for sale, consolidate them into estate?, and let them to tenants for whom their Lordships' House at some not very far distant date would have to pass rent laws and protection laws. It seemed to him to be a very unwise procedure to abolish the system of landlordism now prevailing in Ireland and to lay the foundation of a system infinitely worse. Their Lordships already knew what the acquisition of land by publicans and money-lenders in Ireland meant, so that he need not labour the point.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00329"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I should like to press upon your Lordships the reconsideration of this question. The omission of the clause was proposed, I think, by a noble friend of mine who, I am sorry, is absent this week owing to illness, Lord Inchiquin. He, I think, proposed the omission of the clause on the ground that the strong farmer will be altogether replaced by the small holder. I do not think that is as good a reason as the noble Lord seemed to think, whereas the other reason which has been mentioned by my noble friend Lord MacDonnell I believe to be a very real one. The noble Marquess opposite, when the clause was being discussed, rather derided the notion that anybody would wish to mass holdings together in Ireland. I think it is very likely you will not again see estates run into many tens of thousands of acres, but the sort of purchase by a local moneyed man, who is
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0048"/>
<col>83</col>
also not unlikely to be a lender of money, and the consolidation of a block of holdings in his hands, is a possibility which ought not to be ignored, and consequently we desire to press very strongly once more on your Lordships the importance of restoring this paragraph to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00330"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member> said he had great sympathy with Lord MacDonnell's contention because he saw a possibility of that terror to all Ireland, the gombeen man, coming in and acquiring these farms. It was a well-known fact that a great many parcels of land bought under purchase annuities had changed hands. The Government could not do anything so long as the purchase annuity was paid. Although he had more than once in their Lordships' House stood up for the big farmer, he could not help thinking that a provision such as this would be very advantageous to the small holder and would prevent the one terror in the West of Ireland in the form of the gombeen man and the publican acquiring, as they did acquire, the land on which the small men were paying the purchase annuity. The Government were going to try a great experiment in the West of Ireland as regarded congestion, and he was afraid there would be a very great temptation to the men, whom he should not name but who were now so well known, once they got possession of this land, to pass it on to the two classes of men he had mentioned. Therefore he had a very great sympathy with this clause for that reason.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00331"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> agreed that the gombeen man might get hold of too much land to the exclusion of the small man, but the sum of &#x00A3;5,000 represented about 250 acres only, and surely it was not thought desirable that no man in Ireland should hold more than 250 acres. Surely the right view was that if the landlords left the country&#x2014;as he was afraid many would under the operation of this Act&#x2014;there should be some substantial men to take their place, and that farms should not be stereotyped to a size not exceeding 250 acres.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00333"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said the limit might be disregarded under some special reason, but to put the sum at &#x00A3;5,000 looked as if it were intended by the Government to limit farms in Ireland to 250 acres.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00334"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> wished to ask Lord MacDonnell a question with regard to this matter. Supposing a tenant was a purchaser under the 1903 Act, he was then a proprietor was he not? Very well, the farm was put up to auction by the Estates Commissioners because the man had not paid his rent to the State. Was the proprietor of any other farm under the 1903 Act debarred from bidding and buying at that auction?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00335"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> replied in the negative, and pointed out that the Amendment said that the proprietor should not without the consent of the Land Commission acquire by purchase any other holding for the purchase of which an advance had been made under the Land Purchase Acts if the amount of that advance then outstanding, when added to the amount of the advance or advances made in respect of the holding or holdings then held by the proprietor, exceeded the sum of &#x00A3;5,000; and so long as the advance made to the person who was bidding and the advance made on the property for which he was bidding did not exceed &#x00A3;5,000 he was at liberty to bid and to buy.</p>

This clause, he said, was put down but not reached owing to the closure in the House of Commons for both the Committee and the Report stages of the Bill by Mr. Maurice Healy, who was, perhaps, as well acquainted with the technical working of the Land Purchase Acts as any man in Ireland, and it was put down because there were a very large number of cases, certainly in the South and South-West of Ireland, where these conditions existed, and where, consequently,</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00348">it was impossible for the landlord to sell or the tenant to purchase when both were perfectly agreeable to do so. Section 15 of the Act of 1903 was passed, he believed, with the intention of dealing with this state of things, but difficulties had arisen through a decision in the King's Bench in Ireland in 1905 in a case entitled "Lambkin's Estate <i>ex parte</i> Deane." In that case Mr. Deane was a middleman, holding under a lease of which less than sixty years was unexpired. He could not, therefore, sell to his tenants because he could not qualify as a vendor under the Land Purchase Acts. His interest was accordingly assumed to be what was called an "intervening interest," which could be redeemed under Section 15 of the Act of 1903, and on this assumption the head landlord, Mr. Lambkin, entered
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0050"/>
<col>87</col>
into purchase agreements with the occupying tenants of the lands comprised in Mr. Deane's lease. After the agreements had been signed a question arose as to whether the tenants were still liable to continue paying their rents to their direct landlord, Mr. Deane, and to test this point Mr. Deane instituted ejectment proceedings against one of them. The points involved came before the King's Bench Division, who held unanimously that the case was not within Section 15 of the Act of 1903, because the whole of the lands in the lease from Lambkin to Deane were found to have been sub-let by Deane. He had a copy of a letter from the agent of the estate with regard to this matter. The agent was well known to him. He was a clear and level-headed man, and he wrote this account of what was a typical case under Section 15 of the Act as at the present moment construed&#x2014;
<quote>"The King's Bench Division in Ireland decided unanimously in a considered judgment that the head landlord could not sell under the Act of 1903 to (ho occupying tenants on a middleman's estate where the middleman held for less than sixty years, and the entire of the lands included in the middleman's lease was sub-let. The case was argued at length. I was agent over the head landlord's estate. The circumstances were as follow: Lambkin was head landlord. Deane was middleman with twenty-eight years un-expired of his lease. Lambkin, under counsel's advice, entered into purchase agreements under the Act of 1003 with Deane's sub-tenants, and when the following Gale day of the occupiers' rents fell due Deane brought an action in superior Courts against his largest tenant, who, relying on his purchase agreement with Lambkin, refused to pay the half-year's rent that accrued due after the date of the purchase agreement. The case was argued at length, and the Court reserved judgment and gave the decision I have mentioned."</quote>
This agent told him that he had a large number of estates under him, including from 100 to 220 tenants, all of whom were anxious to buy and the landlords were perfectly willing and ready to sell; but the whole business was stopped by the decision in the case of Lambkin <i>v</i>. Deane. The estates of that class were probably as a rule smallish estates and probably the estates of all others on which it was most important and advisable that the tenants should be made possessors of their holdings. Of course, there was a remedy. The head landlord could buy out the middleman or the middleman could buy out the head landlord, and in that way become the sole landlord and thus be able to deal with the tenants; but in most of these cases neither the head
<col>88</col>
landlord nor the middleman had the money to do it, so that the difficulty remained. He understood there was a certain doubt among lawyers as to the reading of the sections of the Act, and it would appear that this case of Lambkin <i>v</i>. Deane had not been fully reported and was not very well known among lawyers. But the judgment existed, and it was preventing the sale of estates similarly situated. If the noble Earl or his Law Officers had any doubts as to the necessity of such a clause as the one he proposed, and were prepared to look into it, he would suggest that he should be allowed to carry this clause, or, at any rate the first part of it, and that the Law Officers should look into the matter between now and the next stage, or else that it should be considered when their Lordships' Amendments to this Bill came before another place.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00353"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that as this was more or less a technical matter, perhaps he could assist the noble Earl. Deane's estate was a case where all the land was held by a middleman, and it was decided that it did not come within Section 15 of the Act of 1903 because that section enacted that in the case of the sale of an estate the Land Commission might, if they thought fit, declare that any person who, as a subtenant, was in the exclusive occupation of a parcel of land comprised in the estate, should be deemed the tenant of that parcel. It was obvious that did not apply
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0051"/>
<col>89</col>
to tie case where the entire of the estate was sub-let by a middleman to one individual tenant. It would be desirable that the head or superior landlord should be able to sell direct to the sub-tenants and that the middleman's interest should be redeemed out of the purchase money.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00354"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am very much obliged to the noble and learned Lord for the further explanation, although the noble Lord, Lord Barrymore, who, like myself, is a layman, gave a very clear account of the difficulty which has arisen under Section 15 of the Act of 1903. The noble Lord is quite right; I did find myself in some difficulty with regard to this Amendment because the case is not a reported case, and, therefore, we were not in possession of the particular circumstances on which the noble Lord relied. To a layman, although I think I follow the point of the noble and learned Lord, it does seem somewhat absurd that the mere fact of an estate being in that single occupation should keep it out of subsection (1) of Section 15, but I am quite willing, I need hardly say, to take the noble and learned Lord's word for that fact. I think the best course to take would be that suggested by the noble Lord opposite, that he should insert his subsection (1) of the new clause in the Bill, and then we should be able to consider whether we could accept it exactly as it stands or whether it might be possible to do so with some modification. I would assume from what has been said by Lord Barrymore, though I have been told otherwise, that there is a perfect unanimity and agreement between the superior landlord and the middleman as to the desire of the tenants to become purchasers under the Act, but that it was prevented by the construction placed on Section 15 of the Act of 1903.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00356"><member>THE EARL OF CLANWILLIAM</member> moved the insertion of a new clause to provide that where a number of the tenants of an estate had not agreed before the passing of the Act to the terms of purchase arranged with the other tenants the Estates Commissioners might order, subject to the consent of the Treasury, that the tenants so refusing should not be placed in a less advantageous position with

Quite apart from questions of privilege it is not advisable, by a clause here and a clause there, to make additions to that amount.

What was the position of those who came in before the passing of the Act? He understood it was held by lawyers of repute that every tenant who chose to come in before this Act was passed would be debarred in future from coming in at three and a-quarter percent. He was entitled to come in at three and a-quarter percent, now, and therefore the date which had been put in, 15th September, was practically <i>ultra vires</i>.

Part of them take advantage of the opportunity; part of them do not. If this Amendment is added to the Bill I understand the effect will be that the tenants who did not avail themselves of their opportunity would be afterwards, so to speak, brought up to the level of the tenants who did take advantage of their opportunity. If that were done might it not be very unfair to the tenants on an adjoining estate who never had an opportunity at all? If the tenants whom my noble friend wishes to rescue are left out in the cold it is, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, owing to their own fault; and I must say it seems to me it would be

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00373"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved the insertion of a new clause dealing with the constitution of the Congested Districts Board. He said that on the Committee stage of the Bill the <i>personnel</i> of the Congested Districts Board remained unsettled, and his Amendment altered its strength as little as possible. At the present time the Board consisted of eleven members, eight appointed members and three <i>ex officio</i> members. There was, at present, a distinction between temporary and permanent members of the Board, but it was now proposed to abolish that distinction which really never had any great significance. His proposal provided for a twelfth member of the Board, a paid member appointed by the Lord Lieutenant.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0053"/>
<col>93</col>
The other members were, following the existing practice, appointed by His Majesty, but he saw no reason why the paid member of the Board should not be appointed by the Lord Lieutenant who appointed all the other high paid officials, members of the permanent Civil Service, in Ireland. He also provided that one half the existing permanent members should retire when this Act came into operation. At the present time three or four members held office for four years. The rest held office for life. It would be in their Lordships' remembrance that the Bill as it came from the House of Commons provided for the retirement from office of all the existing members of the Board who were not officials, but it seemed to him very desirable that a certain number should retain office and so afford a transition stage and a means of perpetuating the traditions which the Board had hitherto inherited. The only question of importance, in his opinion, was the proposal that half the existing members should retire. He thought it was desirable that there should be fresh blood introduced into the Congested Districts Board. He was aware that certain people considered that if these vacancies were created they would be filled in a particular way. For his own part he believed they would be filled with the sole object of placing upon the Board members who were more or less acquainted with the conditions of the West of Ireland&#x2014;men of independent character and of standing in the country whose presence on the Board would be of great use.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00380"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> opposed the Amendment. At an earlier stage he proposed an Amendment that the time had come for the abolition of the Congested Districts Board and the division of its duties between two other bodies. That did not find favour. On the other hand, the Government proposed that the Board should henceforth be elective, thereby putting upon the Board those who represented the constituents they were returned to represent and so representing various antipathies. The noble Lord had said he preferred the congests to the landless, or lawless, men. He said the existing Board had done good work; their powers were extended, and they had money that they never had before. The way the noble Lord rewarded them for all that was to abolish them within twelve months. The policy was different, the agencies were different, the <i>personnel</i> was different, the aims were all different; and the result would be that if these men were put upon the Board as nominated members the same force that had compelled the Government to create a Board, the real object of which was to prefer the landless men to the congests, would compel the Government to place upon the Board, through nomination, men animated with exactly the same ideas and having the same views as the elected members. This matter was fully discussed on the Committee stage of the Bill. Everybody, he thought, rejected the elected members. Every noble Lord saw clearly that the nominated members would be of exactly the same kind, having the same views and the same objects as the elected members; and therefore it was desirable to give the present Board a chance&#x2014;a Board of which everybody approved, which everybody complimented, which everybody said was a success, and which everybody was willing should continue. And yet, in the face of that success, it was wished to abolish them and place in the hands of the Government the power of putting in their place seven nominated members. The noble Lord himself provided
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0054"/>
<col>95</col>
that immediately three nominated members were to disappear, they were to be followed twelve months after by the remainder of the nominated members; and then there were to be introduced immediately three nominated members and in twelve months three more. The result would be that before twelve months were over their place would know them no more. Lord MacDonnell had said he was fully convinced they would be men who would be wholly animated with a desire to promote the relief of congestion. He did not question the sincerity of that belief for a moment, but he confessed it was not his belief. He had read with great interest all the evidence given before the Congested Districts Board, and he thought there would be seven "Mr. John Fitzgibbon representatives "; and Mr. Fitzgibbon had deliberately said he preferred the landless men to the migrated congests. If men of that policy were to be upon the Board then the relief of congestion became an absolute impossibility. Everybody knew who was the real author of this Bill&#x2014;who was behind it. His impression was that the nominated members would either be the dogs of war or the kennel huntsmen.</p>

I must point out that you have not got it, and whether you get it will depend in no small degree upon the composition, the area, and the powers which it is proposed to give to the Congested Districts Board.

It had been already explained to their Lordships that when the Congested Districts Board was created there was no organisation in Ireland for the promotion or for the care of industries, and naturally it fell to the Congested Districts Board to attend to that important branch of local business within their jurisdiction. When the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction was created, the promotion of industries naturally fell to them, but a divided authority had been for some time exercised, which had led to considerable overlapping and sometimes friction between the two Departments. Inasmuch as the Department of Agriculture was well equipped and organised now and had passed through its novitiate, it was considered desirable that it should take charge of the industries as a portion of its proper functions.</p>

I confess it appears to me that in moving this Amendment to deprive the Congested Districts Board altogether of its care of industries my noble friend is taking a somewhat serious step. What is being done by the different Amendments to the Bill is to change the character of the Congested Districts Board from a great Department dealing with many aspects of social life in the West of Ireland into a mere Land Office. Its only function now will be to cut up
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0056"/>
<col>99</col>
estates into suitable holdings, and that is a work of a technical character which can be done by any well-informed persons. But all that made the Board so distinctive, all its influence upon social life, all the sympathy which it evoked, are going to be swept away altogether, and I should like your Lordships to consider whether it is not the fact that much of the success which the Board has met with in its more formal work in the relief of congestion, has been due to that sympathetic and social side of its work, in which it has been so pre-eminent. I confess that in dealing with this difficult problem of congestion the conversion of the Board into a mere bureau for cutting up farms into strips and squares is a step which I regard with some apprehension. The gentlemen who have hitherto sat on the Congested Districts Board have done the work of it, and have given their time to it, largely in consideration of those other branches of its activity, and I confess that I do not see why, if the Board is going to be of the kind which this Bill seems to contemplate, such people as the noble Earl whom I do not see here, Lord Shaftesbury, should now care to do what I may call supervise the sort of land agent's work, which is all that your Lordships are leaving the Board to do. Under those circumstances I confess I regret the decision which your Lordships' House seems to have arrived at with regard to the functions of the Board. That decision seems to be not merely acquiesced in by my noble friend behind me, but he desires to push it still further. He has, I know, always been a critic of what he considers the excessive paternalism of the Board, but I confess that this sentence from the Report of the Commission appears to me to contain much truth&#x2014;

My Lords, those lines are to disappear altogether. The Board, as I say, is to become a kind of land agency, and knowing the work that it has done in the past I regret it.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00394"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I regret that noble Lords from Ireland, who have more intimate acquaintance with these matters than I can pretend to, are not here to carry on the discussion of the interesting topics which have been raised by the noble Earl in his speech. I can only say, as far as I am able to judge, that the Amendment moved by the noble Lord on the Back Benches opposite seems to me to be consistent with the policy which the House has already adopted. As the Bill now stands, we have actually in Clause 39 transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction such things as the provision of seeds, agricultural instruction, or practical husbandry, the development of forestry and the breeding of live stock and poultry, and the aiding and developing of sea fisheries. Is there any reason why other industries should not follow suit? Our reason for desiring that there should be this transfer of duties is that we have found that in many parts of Ireland the Congested Districts Board and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction were actually overlapping and competing with one another for work in the same districts. That, surely, is not a desirable thing. Then the noble Earl, I gather, suggests that if these different functions are taken away from the Congested Districts Board and transferred to the Department of Agriculture, the Board will really have nothing left to do. He suggested that it was almost absurd to suppose that the Board would be adequately employed in work which he described as cutting up estates, which he thought could be done by anybody. He was of opinion that they would become a mere bureau for cutting up farms into strips and squares. The noble Earl seems to me quite insufficiently to appreciate the immense importance of the functions which will be discharged by the Congested Districts Board when they come to deal with these areas which will be acquired by the Land Commission and handed over to them, so that they may be put into order and improved and developed and rendered fit for occupation by the congested people whom it is desirable to relieve, and who will be settled upon the land which this bureau will have to acquire. I have heard no sufficient reason why other industries should not share the same treatment which the House has already decreed for the matters already enumerated in Section 39, and I am

therefore disposed to vote with the noble Lord who moved this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00395"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said he was sorry he was not in his place to hear the debate upon the Amendment of the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, but as he gathered that the noble Earl who led the House mentioned his name with reference to the Amendment, perhaps he should make it clear to the House that he thought on the whole it would be a wise move to transfer the work the Board had been doing in the nature of industries, for various reasons. One was that under the heading of Industries they had in the congested districts of Ireland domestic economy classes, some carried on by officials belonging to the Board and some carried on by officials belonging to the Agricultural Department. In the 1889 Act the Department encouraged local authorities to lay themselves out for the purpose of industrial schemes, and so they had two Departments working alongside each other in such instruction as domestic economy and other industrial schemes. Under those circumstances he though it would be better if the Board confined itself to what the noble Earl had described as land agency work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00396">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00397"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member>, in moving an Amendment to Clause 40 for the purpose of establishing a committee to allocate the funds to be applied for the benefit of congested districts between the three bodies who had to act in such districts, said that the first of those bodies was the Estates Commissioners, who had the duty of improving the condition of congested districts by enlarging holdings and giving more land to the small holders; secondly, there was the Congested Districts Board, which employed themselves in the same manner and also in endeavouring to relieve congestion by transplanting what were commonly called migrants from the most congested parts to other parts; and finally the Board of Agriculture, which employed itself in improving the condition of the inhabitants of those districts by granting help and instruction in agriculture. The Bill had handed over to the last-named body the development of fisheries and finally it appeared that the promotion of industries was also to be
<col>102</col>
handed over to them. No one could form a right opinion of the respective claims of those Departments and the expenditure entailed by the duties which they had to perform without a thorough knowledge of the conditions circumstances and requirements of the districts, and that knowledge was possessed by those three Departments and by no one else. Therefore it appeared to him to be a perfectly rational position that a committee appointed of equal members from each of those bodies&#x2014;the three Estates Commissioners, three from the Congested Districts Board, and three persons appointed by the Department of Agriculture&#x2014;should meet and deliberate as to what proportion of the funds in each area were required by each of the three Departments. He thought it was perfectly clear, if one Department was too greedy and wanted too much, that the other two Departments would check any such aspirations and they would arrive at as correct, an estimate as could be arrived at as to what the particular requirements of each rendered necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00398">Amendment moved&#x2014;

Provided, however, that neither the Congested Districts Board, nor the Department of Agriculture, nor the Estates Commissioners shall be authorised to expend any of the moneys provided under this section upon any of such purposes, except so far as they respectively are at present, or may from time to time be authorised to expend moneys on such purposes.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clonbrock.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00401"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> hoped that the noble Lord would not press his Amendment. The noble Lord had spoken of the greed of one Department
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0058"/>
<col>103</col>
being checked by the moderation of the other two. In his (Lord MacDonnell's) opinion there would be excessive greed on the part of the three Departments, and it would be impossible where those three Departments were scrambling for the most money that they could get, for them, or for any two of them, to come to a conclusion, unless it was on the understanding that the two that came to the conclusion were to divide the spoils between them. It was a matter of the division of public funds, and he thought that such a matter ought to be left in the hands of the Government. The Government had come very liberally to the assistance of the Congested Districts Board, and no authority was more interested in the efficient discharge of the duties of each Department than the Government, and naturally the procedure of the Government would be to ask the Congested Districts Board, upon which all three Departments would, he hoped, be represented, to furnish them with a report as to how particular funds in particular instances should be allocated, and then the Government would come to a conclusion which would be equitable and just to each Department. In no other way, he ventured to think, would it be possible to come to an equitable distribution of funds in the matter when the time came for a redistribution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00402"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member> could not help thinking that the noble Lord was wrong. His noble friend Lord Clonbrock suggested in his Amendment that the three different Departments should each be represented by three different people, making nine in all; but the noble Lord who had just spoken suggested that one should be the controlling influence over the three&#x2014;that the Congested Districts Board should take up the position of being the dominant partner. He could not help thinking that that would create considerable confusion. They had the Estates Commissioners, who came forward as the new purchasing authority; they had the Congested Districts Board, which appeared to him to be undergoing a very precarious existence at the present moment, and which was supposed to be, according to the noble Lord who had just spoken, a larger authority than the other two; and they had in addition the Department of Agriculture and Technical Education for Ireland. He could not help thinking that the Amendment proposed by his noble friend Lord Clonbrock, associating those three boards together in
<col>104</col>
one joint committee, would be a fair solution of the allocation of the funds, if the noble Earl who led the House could see his way to accept it. The noble Earl on a former occasion rather suggested that there might be a possibility of a little disagreement among the three parties concerned, each pulling in a different direction. He would point out that that applied very largely to all incorporated bodies when they were together looking as it were for the administration of funds, and he could not help thinking that it would be to the advantage of those three Departments whom they on that side of the House wished to see working fairly and justly with the money allocated to them, that the money should be handed over to them and distributed in the way his noble friend suggested. Therefore he would support him in whatever action he chose to take with regard to the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00403"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: This Amendment was moved in the Committee stage, and produced very little discussion. I think that only two, or at the most three, speeches were made upon it at all, and it was not pressed home to any extent by the noble Viscount opposite (Lord Midleton), who on that occasion moved it. I do not know whether I need repeat what I said at that stage as to my view that this is not a practical proposal. All the analogies of joint bodies or joint committee fail when applied to this proposal, because these joint committees of which the noble Earl opposite and others speak are committees from different bodies meeting together to carry out one object or one set of objects. This is a joint committee composed of representatives of three bodies who have to carry out entirely different objects. There is no common basis of agreement; and if the noble Lord contemplates that this committee will in some way cover the whole field of the triple activities of the Estates Commissioners, of the Congested Districts Board, and of the Department of Agriculture, and, having surveyed the whole of that immense field, will then be able in an amicable way to decide the precise sum which ought to be allotted for each purpose, I am afraid he is expecting far too much from a body of the kind. If such a body was formed at all, all I believe that would happen would be that some rough division would be made which would be adhered to without any very close examination. But, my Lords, I object to the general principle
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0059"/>
<col>105</col>
of the allocation of public funds in this way by the representatives of the bodies concerned. The suggestion of His Majesty's Government in the Development Bill may be a good or a bad one, but their suggestion is that certain proposals put forward by particular Departments should be subjected to the review of an outside impartial body. If you were to put together in a room three representatives of the various spending Departments in this country, and ask them to allocate the whole sum voted by Parliament for all of them, I confess I do not know what the result would be. I do not know how many people would leave the room alive, and in any case it seems impossible that the allocation could be conducted on really reasonable lines. I hope that the noble Lord opposite will not press this Amendment, because I am sure it is not of a really practical character.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00404"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said that perhaps he might add a word, as he was the mover of the Amendment in Committee. The noble Earl, he thought, rather assumed that the reason the Amendment was not pressed in Committee was that there was not sufficient argument to be brought forward in support of it. That was not really the cast. They had made a very considerable change in the Bill; they had completely changed the Congested Districts Board as proposed by the noble Earl; they had made very drastic Amendments, and the noble Earl took exception to adding this Amendment without further consideration. Consequently he did at the time withdraw his Amendment with the intention of raising the question again upon Report. Where he thought that the noble Earl had perhaps pressed unduly against the argument of his noble friend behind him, Lord Clonbrock, was when he said they were giving as a sort of scramble to three Boards brought together for that one purpose a sum of public money to be apportioned by them. He would point out that it was not as if the purposes were in any way distinct. The powers of the Estates Commissioners and the powers of the Congested Districts Board were interlaced, and up to now even their jurisdiction to buy land in the same districts was interlaced as well. Therefore, to treat those two authorities as separate and distinct authorities seemed to him to be rather a straining of terms. Again, the Department of Agriculture had almost overlapped in some respects the functions of the Congested
<col>106</col>
Districts Board; and he really would have thought that there was nothing more anomalous in handing over to the authority of the proposed committee a sum of money than there would be in the case either of the Education Office, which had the most varied calls upon it, or still more, any larger Departments, like the War Office and the Admiralty, which were given sums of money which could be spread over a number of services and which were practically allotted by the heads of those Departments. He admitted, of course, that there was no supreme head, except the Chief Secretary, of all the Irish Departments, and in that respect some of those Departments were themselves anomalous as compared to similar Departments in this country; but he must say that he regretted the noble Earl did not see his way to consider the Amendment more favourably. The announcement he made that unless there was a representative Board they would find difficulty with regard to the apportionment of money to the Congested Districts Board, of course might have governed the speech which the noble Earl had just delivered; but he himself would press him not to preclude at this stage of the Bill the adoption of some committee of the kind, which it seemed to him would meet many of the difficulties which had been found by both sides in dealing with the question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00405">On Question, Amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00406"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> moved to amend the first part of Clause 40&#x2014;
<quote>40. As from the appointed day an annual sum of one hundred and sixty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, as follows:&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>Out of that sum an annual sum of nineteen thousand pounds shall be paid to the Department for the purpose of the exercise of the powers and the performance of the duties transferred to the Department under this Act, and the residue shall be paid to the Congested Districts Board,</quote>
by leaving out the words "nineteen thousand pounds" and inserting the words "thirty-nine thousand pounds." He said that his Amendment, at any rate in point of form if not as to the precise amount of money in question, was consequential upon an Amendment which he had the honour of moving in Committee to transfer fisheries from the Congested Districts Board to the Department of Agriculture. It had been pointed out to him that although the fisheries were transferred at that time,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0060"/>
<col>107</col>
no corresponding transfer had been made of the funds which the Congested Districts Board now enjoyed for the purpose of transacting this business, and that it would be essential, of course, for the Department to have that money if they were to have the duty cast upon them. As to the amount, he had not had time to make any very searching inquiries with regard to the exact sum which should be inserted in the Bill, but he was informed that the amount spent upon fisheries by the Congested Districts Board was about &#x00A3;20,000, and therefore he proposed to add the sum of &#x00A3;20,000 to the sum of &#x00A3;19,000 which was already in the Bill, thus making a total of &#x00A3;39,000.</p>

There is another fund&#x2014;the Irish Loan Fund and a part of the Sea Coast Fisheries Fund&#x2014;which was placed at the disposal of the Congested Districts Board under the Act of 1891. It is Section 35, subsection (5). These funds, I take it, if the noble Lord's plan is carried out, ought also to be transferred. I do not know that I need make any further observation.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00411"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> asked whether the noble Earl who led the House could give some indication of the allocation of these funds, because, as he had truly said, the fisheries had been transferred from the Congested Districts Board to the Board of Agriculture. The noble Earl also said it was unusual for such an Amendment to be put down and for such a matter to be raised in their Lordships' House, but the noble Earl had admitted that there must be some indication of how the funds were to be used. Would the noble Earl, therefore, giving some indication to that effect on the Third Reading?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00412"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I can give the noble Earl an indication now&#x2014;namely, to the effect that we do not agree to the transfer of the fisheries from the Congested Districts Board to the Department of Agriculture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00413"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said that what that amounted to was, "As you have done this certain thing, therefore you are not to move an Amendment; and if you do move an Amendment, although I have said that there is no doubt that the way in which these funds should be dealt with ought to be indicated&#x2014;because you have done this naughty thing, we can give you no information whatsoever." That was really what the noble Earl's statement amounted to, and he did not think it was satisfactory. It would be most interesting to the Board in Ireland if they could have some indication of what the funds were. Two of the most important industries were the salting of mackerel for the American market and the curing of herrings, and if there could be some indication of the amount of money to be allocated at all events to those two very important industries, it would be an immense help to those who lived in Ireland and who took an interest in the work, which, as the Bill stood at present, was to be carried out by the Department of Agriculture and not by the Congested Districts Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00414"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> thought he could throw a little light upon the question. At the time of the Dudley Commission the question of the amount of funds expended upon fisheries and industries was calculated. The promotion of agricultural industries had been already transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Education. That
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0061"/>

was before the Dudley Commission. When the Commission sat, it was ascertained that the average annual expenditure upon fisheries and upon industries was &#x00A3;16,000. Therefore, as the Bill contained the sum of &#x00A3;19,000, an addition of &#x00A3;3,000 had been made on the transfer of these two Departments, which seemed to him an adequate amount to be granted on the occasion of a transfer, and from his point of view he saw no necessity for making any change whatever in the Bill as it stood.</p>

The great popularity which attached to the Board in Ireland was due to the belief that they were an independent Board which could look at the facts of Irish life unhampered by Treasury rules and restrictions, although, of course, limited by the funds which they had to dispose of. He had come to think that, inasmuch as the provisions which laid down the rules for forming a quorum and meetings of the Congested Districts Board had been removed from the Bill, some such rule as this might be necessary if strictly limited; and he therefore had come to the conclusion, very largely in deference to the
<col>110</col>
opinion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, that the Privy Council, whose opinion was to be taken on the rules, might be trusted to see that there was no unfair limitation of the freedom of action of the Congested Districts Board. But since then, and in connection with what happened yesterday, it seemed to him if rules were made by the Lord Lieutenant on the advice of his Privy Council, they would still have to be laid on the Table of both Houses, with the result that it was very possible there might be a conflict of opinion regarding the rules, and in the meantime if such a conflict did arise the Congested Districts Board might be at a serious disadvantage in the performance of its duties. He thought that some understanding had been come to yesterday in another connection whereby the chances of such a conflict might be avoided; he did not know himself the precise arrangement, but he took it for granted that some such matter was under consideration; and if His Majesty's Government were satisfied that such a conflict of opinion and such difficulties could be prevented, he was willing to waive any objection he might have on that particular head, and to withdraw his Amendment.</p>

The House would certainly wish that my noble friend should have an opportunity of stating the reasons why he prefers his own proposals to those of the noble and learned Lord opposite, whereas if the noble and learned Lord's clauses are all adopted one after the other my noble friend is shut out altogether and his Amendment falls to the ground. I should have ventured to suggest, with the concurrence of noble Lords opposite, that the best course would be either for the noble and learned Lord to develop his scheme on this clause, or else that these clauses, if the House so desires, should be passed <i>pro forma</i>, and that a discussion should then be allowed to take place on the joint schemes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00441"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> pointed out that whatever form of compulsion was adopted his Amendment was perfectly harmless and did not prejudice it. It merely confined those clauses to voluntary acquisition, leaving compulsory acquisition to be subsequently dealt with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00442"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that while what the noble and learned Lord stated was quite correct, he also had proposed an alternative scheme for voluntary acquisition of land, which was a rival, if he might be permitted to say so, of the scheme which the noble and learned Lord had proposed. The noble and learned Lord's proposals in regard to voluntary acquisition of land had been quite recently made. The scheme as placed before their Lordships by the noble and learned Lord was one for compulsory acquisition alone. No doubt that was due to the noble and learned Lord's mind being altogether concentrated on the question of compulsory acquisition; but when his mind was opened to the fact that it was also necessary to provide a scheme for voluntary acquisition, which his (Lord MacDonnell's) plan did provide but which the plan of the noble and learned Lord did not, he corrected his scheme and now it was both for voluntary acquisition and for compulsory acquisition. The position, therefore, was that there were
<col>114</col>
two rival schemes before their Lordships, and if the noble and learned Lord was allowed to develop his scheme for voluntary acquisition, he (Lord MacDonnell) would be shut out from developing his scheme for voluntary acquisition, so that he thought in fair play to both of them the proposal which he had submitted, and which the noble Earl who led the House had submitted, was a proper one to adopt, and should be given effect to, and that the noble and learned Lord should either develop his whole plan now, or that he (Lord MacDonnell) should be allowed to develop his.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00443"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> asked whether there was any good in making a contest before it was necessary. He apprehended that no disagreement would arise in accepting his noble and learned friend's Amendment now, because the next Amendment on the Paper in the name of his noble and learned friend would fit in with either scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00444"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that was not so. It would require that his scheme should be modified.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00448"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> pointed out that he had an Amendment on the Paper to leave out Clause 47 altogether. The position was that if the House adopted the scheme of the noble Lord opposite, he supposed the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, would not move his Amendment at all, and there would be no opportunity of any one moving the omission of Clause 47.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00449"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> desired to support his noble friend Lord Oranmore and Browne in moving the deletion of Clause 47.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00450"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: We are now, I understand, strictly speaking, dealing with Lord Atkinson's Amendment to Clause 44. As that raises incidentally the general question of the scheme for this part of the Bill, I understand it is suggested by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack that the House should be allowed the latitude of a general discussion which would enable the three or four rival schemes, for I think there are as many on the Paper, to be considered, and I presume that would end in some general indication on the part of the House of their preference for either one or other of the rival solutions. That being done, I imagine we should then take the Amendments on the Paper <i>seriatim</i>, so that my noble friends who are anxious that their particular Amendments, dealing some of them, perhaps, with minor points, should be considered, may not lose their opportunity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00451"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> was perfectly willing to fall in with an arrangement of that kind if it was the desire of the House. Therefore, he presumed that his task was to show what the two schemes would be, one of acquiring land voluntarily and the other of acquiring land compulsorily, if the Amendments he suggested were agreed to.
<col>116</col>
The two Amendments he proposed were merely for the purpose of making a clause which was ambiguous clear, and to show that it applied only to the acquisition of land by voluntary agreement. Accordingly, at line 12 of Clause 44 he proposed to put in the words of which he had given notice, "otherwise than by the exercise of the compulsory powers by this Act conferred upon them," to show that the clause was exclusively confined to the acquisition of land by voluntary agreement. Then when he came to line 14, it was absolutely necessary to strike out the words "shall proceed to acquire the estate or land accordingly," because that made it obligatory upon the Land Commission to acquire the land, by offering an extravagant price possibly, or by the exercise of compulsory powers. That was entirely ambiguous, and therefore his second Amendment would introduce the words "shall take all reasonable and proper steps to acquire the estate or land by voluntary agreement on such terms as they shall in the circumstances deem reasonable." That removed any ambiguity and showed that there was no compulsion of any kind; that the Land Commission were not compelled to acquire the land, but to proceed to take all reasonable and proper steps to acquire it voluntarily. If his two Amendments were accepted, the clauses would, in his opinion, have an easily workable machinery for acquiring the land by voluntary agreement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00452">Then they came to Clause 47 and the three following clauses which set up the machinery for acquiring the land compulsorily. Those three clauses substantially embodied the Amendment that he had the honour to propose. They were based in a great degree upon the procedure under the Small Holdings Act of 1907, and as they stood the machinery was that the Congested Districts Board when they wanted to acquire land compulsorily for relieving congestion by one specific method&#x2014;namely, the increasing of uneconomic holdings up to &#x00A3;10 in value&#x2014;would draw up their scheme, and they would submit that scheme to the Land Commission as the Bill stood, and the scheme would be accompanied by a statement under the hand of the Secretary of the reasons for which they had come to a conclusion that it was necessary to employ compulsion. The Estates Commissioners, one of them being the Judicial Commissioner, would consider
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0065"/>
<col>117</col>
the scheme, and if they thought that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out, viewing it with the statement of facts accompanying it, they would publish notices, and objections would be sent in. Those objections would then be considered by the tribunal composed of a Judge from the rota, the Judicial Commissioner, and one of the Estates Commissioners who had considered the original proposals. One of the objections that might be made was that compulsion was unnecessary. He would state presently what that involved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00453">It was suggested that the particulars that were required to be inserted in the claim were too voluminous and that they were also embarrassing, because he required the Congested Districts Board to state to whom they proposed to give the land that they had so acquired. He understood it was said that that was impossible in practice, and he had accordingly struck out several clauses which dealt with that so as to simplify as far as possible the scheme that had to be sent in. He had also proposed to modify it by the Amendments be bad put down in this respect, that instead of having the Estates Commissioners and the Judicial Commissioner to take part in considering the scheme as first submitted, together with the Secretary of the Congested Districts Board, it should be considered by the Estates Commissioners alone, the Judicial Commissioner being left out. The tribunal before which it came would be the same, but the difference was that two members of the tribunal were entire strangers to the transaction, the only person who had any previous acquaintance with it being one of the Estates Commissioners who had considered it in the first instance&#x2014;that one Estates Commissioner being the one whom the Estates Commissioners themselves selected to preside there on that occasion. He thought it desirable to introduce this Estates Commissioner for the reason that he was in touch with the operations: he knew what had gone on, and what would be done if the scheme was carried through. He thought, therefore, it was desirable that one, at all events, of the Estates Commissioners who was cognisant of all the operations should be selected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00454">If no objection was made, and the scheme went through, an Order would be issued that on payment of the price, which was to
<col>118</col>
be fixed in a manner he would mention hereafter, the land should vest in the Congested Districts Board. The price or compensation was to be fixed as under the Small Holdings Act of 1905 by an independent arbitrator. That was according to the Bill as it stood, and he did not propose to make any change in that. He thought it far better that it should state at once that the price was to be fixed by an independent arbitrator than by two arbitrators and an umpire. He never knew of a case conducted by an arbitrator on each side and an umpire where the arbitrators appointed by the respective parties had not considered themselves advocates for the sides they represented. Each arbitrator dealt with the interests of the side he represented, and ultimately, therefore, the decision was the decision of the umpire. So that he got rid of the arbitrators appointed by the parties, and suggested that it should be, as in the Small Holdings Act and the Railways Act, by an independent arbitrator appointed by an entirely independent body&#x2014;namely, the Board of Works, who were competent to discharge such a duty. He provided, however, by an Amendment which he proposed to introduce, that where the parties so desired it, after the investigation had been gone through, the compensation might be fixed by the tribunal. It might be that after the investigation had been conducted the tribunal were in a position to deal with it, and if the parties agreed, of course, there was no separate inquiry necessary at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00455">It was suggested as an objection to his Amendment when he originally moved it that his scheme would involve a great many hearings. That was an absolute mistake There was only one hearing. The first investigation was not a hearing at all. The Estates Commissioners took the particulars and looked into the matter, and if they thought it a <i>bona fide</i> case they put the thing in train, giving every opportunity for the people to make an objection. What was the objection that might be made? First of all, it might be objected that the case came within the particular sections of the Act which said that certain land should not be acquired; but the important thing which distinguished the Amendment he had introduced from the original Bill and also from the Amendments of the noble Lord opposite, was that the question whether it was necessary to employ compulsion at all could be raised by objection, and it would have to be proved.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0066"/>
<col>119</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00456">He knew that many noble Lords were accustomed to judicial investigation. Supposing that they were sitting upon a tribunal where the party came forward and asked for compulsory powers, the first question he would be asked would be, "You want this land; is it the only suitable land? Can you not get other suitable land? If you can compulsion is unnecessary." The answer would be, "No, I can get no other land so suitable as this." "Very well, that being so, have you tried to get this land by voluntary agreement?" "No." "Then you have no right to come here and ask for compulsory powers, for such powers are only to be given to you when you cannot get land by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price." Then if the party applying said, "I made an offer to the landlord and he would not accept it," the tribunal would ask, "What was your offer?" "My offer was so much," would be the reply. "That is entirely too small," the tribunal might say, "and we will not give you compulsory powers unless you have made a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to get this land by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price." So that many of the agreements on the paper requiring the parties to state the price and to offer a price and so on were absolutely and entirely unnecessary. They were covered by the wide general requirement that they must prove that suitable land could not be got by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price. That would have to be established before the tribunal before whom it came; otherwise they would not give compulsory powers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00457">The only other observation he had to make was that he did not propose to modify the appeal. There was an appeal on law and on mixed questions of law and fact to the Court of Appeal, but he dared say that the question whether compulsion was necessary or not&#x2014;that was, whether the land could be obtained by voluntary agreement or not&#x2014;would be in most cases a question of fact, and, of course, if that were so there would be no appeal. That was a consistent scheme, and one which he did not think any person could have very great objection to. It provided that the necessity for compulsion should be judged of by an independent tribunal, and that the compensation should be assessed by an independent tribunal on the principle that a man must be compensated for the loss inflicted upon him by being deprived of his property. That was what his scheme
<col>120</col>
would be if he succeeded in the change he proposed. He thought it was much better to divide the two schemes, one giving a complete machinery for the acquisition of land by voluntary agreement, and the other a complete and adequate machinery for the acquisition of land by compulsion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00458">He saw other Amendments on the Paper. With regard to one of those Amendments, he might say that his desire was to give compulsion under a reasonable scheme for the purpose of increasing uneconomic holdings. He did not want to make it too tight, provided it was effective and reasonable, and he did not want the appointment of any Judge to be an appointment <i>ad hoc</i>. For that reason he had put it that the Judge on the rota should be appointed as provided in the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907. He thought that was much more satisfactory than that a Judge should be appointed either permanently or from time to time as occasion required for that particular business by the King's Bench Division. He would not discuss the rival scheme of Lord MacDonnell further than to say that if imitation was the truest form of flattery he ought to be much obliged to the noble Lord, who had taken the best parts of his scheme. Originally as the noble Lord's Amendment was framed there was no family resemblance between them, but he observed that the tribunal the noble Lord had selected was very much the same as the one he had himself selected. There was this objection to the noble Lord's scheme which to his mind was a fatal one&#x2014;namely, the question whether the employment of compulsion was necessary or not could not be raised before the tribunal. That was the particular vice, as he thought, of the original Bill, and it was the particular vice of the noble Lord's scheme. He might be a little extravagant on these matters, but there was to him nothing more repulsive than the idea of any body of men, without the control of any person, being allowed to take an individual piece of land compulsorily of their own motion; and if he did not do the noble Lord an injustice in supposing that that was what he intended, then he asked the House to prefer his scheme to that of the noble Lord, because the best thing about it was that it provided for an independent tribunal investigating anything turning on the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0067"/>
<col>121</col>
question whether compulsion was necessary at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00459"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that when the matter was last before their Lordships' House two schemes were presented to them for consideration, and in the speech of the noble Marquess who led the Opposition it was mentioned, if he remembered rightly, that there were good points in both schemes. The noble Marquess did not much care which scheme was accepted for the moment, but he stated that whatever scheme was accepted the good points of the other scheme which might happen to be wanting in the one which was accepted should be incorporated, and he laid down one strong requirement&#x2014;namely, that property was not to be compulsorily taken unless a decision had been come to by a competent and impartial tribunal that compulsory acquisition was necessary. The next point that the noble Marquess laid down was that the procedure should be as simple as was consistent with effective work. The noble Marquess thought that the scheme of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, was surrounded by a zareba of precautions, and he suggested that there was no necessity for all these legal formalities and precautions, and that the noble and learned Lord's scheme might be divested of some of them without suffering therefrom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00460">Owing to an accident he was absent from the House at the moment when a Division had been taken upon the scheme of the Government. If he had been there he supposed the Lord Chairman would have asked him to speak to his scheme, as he had called upon him to speak in the first instance; and it was not altogether impossible that if he had not accidentally been absent the scheme upon the Paper now would have been his scheme. He might be wrong in that, but it was not a matter of very much moment. Two schemes were before their Lordships, one of them the scheme of the noble and learned Lord for the compulsory acquisition of land alone. It made no provision for the amicable acquisition of land by bargaining between the vendor and the purchaser. That was an initial defect in the scheme of the noble and learned Lord which he had now corrected. The noble and learned Lord said that he (Lord MacDonnell) had copied him. He was quite sure that he might with great advantage to himself copy
<col>122</col>
a good deal fom the noble and learned Lord and in the scheme which was now before their Lordships he had to a certain extent copied from him, but the noble and learned Lord had also paid him the high compliment of copying from him. He did not make those remarks with any intention of unnecessary comparison; he made them with the object of showing how far the two schemes were identical, and in what respect his scheme was better than that of the noble and learned Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00461">The scheme of the noble Lord as printed, as he had already said, was a compulsory one, and now he had introduced voluntary provisions, and there the noble and learned Lord's ideas were taken from his scheme. The noble and learned Lord's first scheme placed the initial inquiries on the shoulders of the Judicial Commissioners and two Estates Commissioners, whereas the scheme now fell into line with his own, in placing the initial inquiry on the Estates Commissioners alone. Again, in the noble and learned Lord's first scheme he made his tribunal to consist of two Estates Commissioners, the Judicial Commissioner and a Judge of the High Court. The noble and learned Lord now did him the honour of adopting his Court, consisting of one Estates Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioner and a Judge of the High Court; but he differed from him in preserving the Court of Appeal, and that was a point upon which he thought the noble Marquess who led the Opposition was particularly insistent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00462"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said the noble Lord was in error. He had only put one Commissioner on the tribunal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00463"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>begged the noble and learned Lord's pardon if he was in error, but he thought the scheme of Lord Atkinson originally included two Estates Commissioners. The noble and learned Lord had preserved the Court of Appeal. He provided for a Court consisting of the Judicial Commissioner, a Judge of the High Court, and one Estates Commissioner. The noble and learned Lord considered that that high judicial body was incompetent to decide questions of law and fact connected with the acquisition of an estate or of untenanted land. He (Lord MacDonnell) was strongly of opinion that where they had a body of that character and composition
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0068"/>
<col>123</col>
they ought to trust it with final discretion upon such a point as that. The noble and learned Lord provided that the final fixation of the price should not rest with the high judicial body he bad mentioned, but that there should be appointed for the purpose an arbitrator chosen by the Public Works Department under the Lands Clauses Acts. He did not speak on the point with such great knowledge and judicial experience as the noble and learned Lord but he would ask their Lordships whether he was wrong in saying that from the decision of an arbitrator appointed under the Lands Clauses Acts&#x2014;that was to say under 14 and 15 Victoria, Chapter 7, Section 26&#x2014;it was possible to carry the case to a Judge of Assize and a petty jury.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00464"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that if the compensation was assessed under the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, there was an appeal to a jury no doubt, but the noble Lord had not read his clause because the clause provided that it should be assessed by a single arbitrator on the principle of the Lands Clauses Act. The noble Lord was apparently confounding the machinery of the Act with its principles.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00465"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the words of the noble and learned Lord, now in the Bill, were&#x2014;
<quote>"Upon the making of an order by the aforesaid tribunal or by the Court of Appeal over-ruling all objections, or of the making of an order by the said Commissioners where no objection has been made, or if made has been withdrawn, or within a reasonable time thereafter the compensation payable in respect of the lands taken or injuriously affected or shall be determined in the manner prescribed by a single arbitrator appointed by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, on the principles on which compensation is awarded for lands taken compulsorily under the Lands Clauses Acts."</quote>
He would ask the noble and learned Lord whether on the principle contained in that subclause it was not open to either party, under Section 26 of 14 and 15 Victoria, Chapter 70, to carry the case to a Judge of Assize who would empanel a petty jury whose decision would be final, so that the fixation of the price in Ireland would be determined by a petty jury such as noble Lords opposite from Ireland were acquainted with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00466"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> repeated that the noble Lord was entirely wrong and was confounding the machinery of the Lands
<col>124</col>
Clauses Act with the principle of the Lands Clauses Act. The principle of that Act was that a man should get compensation for being injuriously affected by his land being taken compulsorily from him. The machinery of the Lands Clauses Act was a traverse of the award of the arbitrator and a trial by a jury, but he had followed word for word the Small Holdings Act of 1907 under which it had never been suggested that there was any power of appeal to a jury. There were many other Acts in which the same phraseology was used providing for compensation to be fixed by an independent arbitrator; but using the principle of the Act of 1845 did not bring in the machinery.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00467"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said there was not one word in the noble and learned Lord's scheme excluding the right which the Statute conferred upon either party to the arbitration to bring the matter before a Court of Assize and a petty jury, so that he maintained under the terms of the noble and learned Lord's scheme it was possible that the price of all land acquired compulsorily under the scheme would be fixed by a petty jury. Noble Lords opposite, he thought, would scarcely like to have the price of their lands assessed by a petty jury in Ireland. That was a matter which, of course, might be, and no doubt would be, corrected in drafting.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00468">As the scheme was produced in the first instance, a representation had to be made in a certain form to the Estates Commissioners. That form required information to be given which it was, as the noble and learned Lord now admitted, practically impossible to give. That defect in the scheme had been removed to some extent, but he would not admit that it had been entirely removed. Next, under the scheme as first submitted, that proposal came before the Judicial Commissioner together with two of the Estates Commissioners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00469"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that if the noble Lord would look at page 25 of the Bill he would see that subclause (5) provided that where objection was made it should be heard by the tribunal there set out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00470"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> replied that the noble and learned Lord was inviting him to jump over a stage in his argument, which he was not disposed to do.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0069"/>
<col>125</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00471"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> could only say that if the noble Lord cared to argue a thing which existed at stage one but which was removed and did not exist at stage five, he could say no more; but it certainly seemed to be unnecessary and to lead to confusion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00472"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the noble and learned Lord could revel in the anticipation of that confusion, but he preferred to conduct his argument in his own way. A requisition was put forward which the noble and learned Lord now admitted was impossible of fulfilment. It was to come before the Judicial Commissioner together with two of the Estates Commissioners. Those three gentlemen were to inquire into the merits of the scheme, and if satisfied that it was <i>prima facie</i> necessary for the land to be acquired compulsorily they were to do certain things. He took the objection, on the last occasion when he was speaking on the point, that it was highly undesirable to submit a scheme which was carefully prepared by a competent body, to another not more competent body which was not a judicial one and which was not held in popular esteem in Ireland higher than the Congested Districts Board, upon whose representation it was to pass judgment. He submitted on that occasion that it was far better that no judgment should be passed on the representation or the application of the Congested Districts Board by the Estates Commissioners, whose functions in the matter should be purely ministerial. When objections to the acquisition of the land were made, those objections were to be laid before a judicial body. The creation of the judicial body was a point which he was glad to take from the noble and learned Lord, and he did it in compliance with what was insisted upon by the noble Marquess who led the Opposition, that if any objection were taken to the acquisition of the land that objection should be decided upon by a perfectly independent tribunal. He (Lord MacDonnell) therefore took a tribunal composed of one Estates Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioner, and a Judge of the High Court, and he made the decision of that body on the question of whether land should be acquired or not a final decision. Furthermore, he thought under the present scheme that the issues to be raised before that body should be definite, and that a general power of
<col>126</col>
inquiring and seeing whether any objection should be made or could be made was not a sort of mandate which should be given to the tribunal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00473">Their Lordships' House, by a large majority, had affirmed the principle of compulsory acquisition in certain cases. That being so, it seemed to him to be essential that the determination of the question whether a particular plot of land should be acquired or should not be acquired ought to be limited to the consideration of certain points, and those points he had put down in his Amendment as follows&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) that the estate or land is not suitable for the relief of congestion;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) that the acquisition of the estate or land is not necessary for relief of congestion;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) that the estate or land and all within the categories of land exempted from acquisition by section fifty (4) of this Act."</li></ol>
The fifty-fourth clause of the Bill he took bodily from the scheme of the noble and learned Lord. He had himself certain proposals on the Paper which covered one-half of the noble and learned Lord's proposals, but he was glad to take the noble and learned Lord's as being more complete. When the tribunal which he so constituted had come to a conclusion that the land on any one or other of those grounds ought not to be acquired, the case failed and no further action was taken. When, however, the tribunal was of opinion that none of those grounds of objection prevailed, the Estates Commissioners having received the order of the Court, would then proceed to acquire the land. The objections to which the noble Marquess called attention having thus been disposed of, nothing remained except the fixation of the price. His object was that the price should be fixed by a tribunal as independent, as well informed, and as competent as the tribunal which had decided upon the right to acquire, and consequently he used the same tribunal, varying, if necessary, either the Estates Commissioner or the Judge. When the Estates Commissioners proceeded executively to acquire the land they made the usual inquiries, ascertained all the particulars necessary to enable them to estimate the price, and made an offer. If the owner was pleased with the offer he accepted it, and the case proceeded in the ordinary way; if he did not accept the offer, he appealed to the Court and the Court inquired into the adequacy of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0070"/>
<col>127</col>
price and gave a final order. He would ask their Lordships to compare the final order of a Court composed of the Judicial Commissioner, a Judge of the King's Bench Division of the High Court, and one of the Estates Commissioners with that of a petty jury in the West of Ireland. That was a position which their Lordships had to consider.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00474">Another point was that when the acquisition was determined upon, the tribunal fixed a price in different ways in the scheme of the noble and learned Lord and himself. The noble and learned Lord would deny to the vendor any bonus upon the purchase price because, forsooth, he refused to accept the offer in the first instance and exercised his right of appealing to have the rent fixed. He did not see why such a threat as that should be held over vendors to compel them to accept the price offered in the first instance. It seemed to him that advantage was thereby being taken of the necessities of the vendor, and in his opinion no disadvantage should attach in the case of a vendor who thought he had not been offered a full price and who got from the Court a price which in the judgment of the Court was fair. Those were the salient differences between his proposal and that of the noble and learned Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00475">He submitted to their Lordships that his proposal was a simple and consistent one throughout, that there was an entire absence of anything like duplication of procedure, and that there was the arbitrament in every case of a responsible tribunal. There was no appeal from the lowest to the highest Courts in the land thus increasing costs and putting litigants to all the expense and delay of the law. If the proposals which he placed before their Lordships were adopted, they would find that land acquisition in Ireland would go forward smoothly and expeditiously, without friction, and to the satisfaction of all concerned. On the other hand, he felt confident that if they adhered to the provisional adoption of the noble and learned Lord's proposals they would want such a degree of modifications, qualifications, additions, and omissions that their Lordships would not be able to get over the business that night.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00476"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> would not repeat what he had already said, because he felt it was hopeless to try and remove the
<col>128</col>
impression with regard to the petty jury from the noble Lord's mind. It seemed to amount almost to hallucination. With regard to the noble Lord's point about the bonus, if the noble Lord understood the Lands Clauses Act he would have seen that he was giving vendors a great deal more than the bonus because he was giving them the ten per cent. which was always accorded under the Lands Clauses Act, and which was a great deal more than the bonus. He had struck out the bonus because the bonus was an inducement to a man to sell and had no application to a case where a man had to sell compulsorily, and he had particularly provided that the ten per cent., as under the Lands Clauses Act, should invariably be added to the price. What were the circumstances which the noble Lord said distinguished his scheme from his own and made the noble Lord's much simpler and cheaper and shorter? The noble Lord had provided for no appeal in his proposal. When they had appeals to the Court of Appeal in Ireland on matters not one-half or one-tenth as important, he thought it was desirable that there should be a power of appeal in this matter on questions of law. He did not, of course, say that the Court of Appeal should re-try pure questions of fact. But the real substantial fight and litigation was precisely the same under the scheme of the noble Lord, and the tribunal was the same. There was no wonder that it should be so, for the noble Lord had copied the tribunal from his scheme.</p>

He noticed that the noble Lord had skilfully evaded the real point in the case, which was, Did he or did he not give the tribunal power to determine whether compulsory acquisition was or was not necessary? That was very ambiguously provided for in the noble Lord's scheme, which said that one of the objections must be that the acquisition of the estate or land was not necessary for the relief of congestion. He did not know what that meant.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00479"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said it meant that an objection would be a valid one where it was proved that congestion could be relieved otherwise than by the acquisition of the particular piece of land in question.</p>

What were the other matters on which the noble Lord objected to his scheme? The schemes balanced each other on the point that there was to be one hearing before the same tribunal, and there would not be any more expense in one case than in the other. With regard to the particular virtue claimed by the noble Lord for his proposal in having a Judge of the Superior Court and the Judicial Commissioner and one of the Estates Commissioners as the tribunal to determine the price, he should have thought that that was a most awkward tribunal for such a purpose. He made them the tribunal when the parties consented; the noble Lord made them the tribunal whether the parties consented or not.</p>

There are two rival schemes before the House, one of them propounded by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, and criticised by the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, and the other propounded by Lord MacDonnell and criticised by Lord Atkinson. Surely, my Lords, the House itself is competent to judge of the merits of the various schemes quite apart from the conversation of the two noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00488"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he would only add one word. Lord MacDonnell had suggested that it would be offensive to the Congested Districts Board that their proposal should come before the Estates Commissioners at all. He did not see how that lessened the dignity of the Congested Districts Board in the least, or why it should be looked upon as an offence against them. The Congested Districts Board would have to buy the land from them, and when they put forward a scheme it was not unreasonable, surely, to ask the Estates Commissioners to look at it and see whether <i>prima facie</i> it was a scheme that ought to be enforced. The Estates Commissioners were the instruments by which the scheme was enforced, and the idea that an offence would be committed against the Congested Districts Board by asking the Estates Commissioners to say whether the scheme was right or not, seemed to him to be imaginary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00489"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> was sure the House had listened with great interest to the duel that had taken place with regard to the rival schemes before their Lordships, but he thought that perhaps they had now reached a time when those in whom the parental interest in the scheme was not so acute might be allowed to say a word. He was afraid that many members of the House would feel, however good a substratum had been laid down, that his noble and learned friend's Amendment, which was adopted rather hurriedly on the last occasion when it was discussed, did not altogether carry out even the principle which the noble and learned Lord had himself laid down. The noble
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0072"/>
<col>131</col>
and learned Lord had insisted throughout the discussion that if they were to have compulsion they must have an absolutely impartial Court to decide as to the necessity for it, and also an impartial tribunal to fix upon the price. He confessed when he approached the question&#x2014;and he hoped he might be allowed to say so again because he believed it was the opinion of the great majority of their Lordships' House&#x2014;that the whole question of importing compulsion into the Bill was an anomaly. It might be necessary from the point of view of the Government, but it seemed to him that it was absolutely anomalous, when they had the Congested Districts Board with already an enormous amount of land which they could not employ, and when they had agreements extending into &#x00A3;50,000,000 for voluntary purchase which they could not liquidate, for the Government to come and say that the Bill could not be carried out without compulsion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00490">He had in his pocket at that moment a letter which illustrated the absurdity of a Government Department holding such a large amount of land in their hands. He could remember a time when members of the House of Commons used to receive many letters from people complaining of their treatment by the National League and saying that there ought to be reform, but that no names must be mentioned. As he said, he had a letter from a man stating that his market had been spoiled by the Congested Districts Board, which had undersold him, and that his holding was less remunerative, and yet he added&#x2014;
<quote>"I do implore your Lordship, if you make use of these facts, not to disclose my name, or I shall be boycotted by the Congested Districts Hoard and utterly ruined."</quote>
That showed, he thought, that when there was a million pounds worth of land in the hands of a Government Department there were dangers existing which made it desirable not to increase the amount. Yet they had been told that it was absolutely necessary that a power of compulsion should be given to deal with isolated cases.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00491">He thought it was perfectly clear, from the discussion they had heard on both sides of the House, that the Amendment of Lord MacDonnell did not provide for an impartial tribunal to investigate the necessity of taking land. The noble Lord
<col>132</col>
had been champion of a great many causes throughout the debate, some of them lost causes, and he ventured to say that this was one of them. He hoped their Lordships would remember that it was not going to be a question of merely taking a few acres here and there for a cottage or a garden, or even for an allotment or small holding, it was an operation which might affect hundreds or thousands of acres belonging to one individual, which they were going to take away without the least desire on the part of the owner to sell, and that would probably be what would happen in the case of many noble Lords sitting behind him, who farmed large portions of their estates and who would be the first target for compulsion, if compulsion was to be exercised. It was proposed to take away from a man of that kind his occupation and also to take away from him what he had hitherto regarded as his own by right, and that being so he thought the least they could do was to make certain that on the question of the necessity of having that land taken away from him he should have the right of an appeal to a tribunal which was impartial.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00492">He was not at all satisfied, as he had pointed out before, with the tribunal suggested by the noble and learned Lord. He provided that one of the Estates Commissioners and the Judicial Commissioner should sit with a rota Judge, and that those three, of whom one was certainly committed already and a second would by hypothesis support his colleague, should be the tribunal to decide this question. He would like to see the Estates Commissioners apart from the Judicial Commissioner left out of the business altogether. They had to form a scheme, and they could not help being swayed by the fact, which one of them in his evidence before the Dudley Commission made perfectly clear, that they had to consider how the man they were going to put on the land was going to make a profit out of it: he might, perhaps, not be a satisfactory farmer, but they were bound to put him in a better position. He hoped their Lordships would favourably consider any Amendment which made the tribunal consist of the Judicial Commissioner and a Judge of the High Court, or two Judges of the High Court, because he did not think it was too much to ask, where the litigants were a Government Department on the one side and an owner on the other, that the owner should have the right of claiming the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0073"/>
<col>133</col>
assistance of Judges of the High Court to decide his case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00493">As to price, the noble and learned Lord told their Lordships with great emphasis that it was a mistake to have two arbitrators with an umpire. He said he knew of no case in which both the arbitrators did not consider themselves to be advocates on either side, and that the umpire was certain to have to be called in to decide between them. He had had some experience of such arbitrations, and on the spur of the moment he remembered one case when he was at the War Office in which it was desired to take a very large tract of land. The question that came up for decision in that arbitration involved a sum of something like &#x00A3;90,000 or &#x00A3;100,000. The War Office appointed an arbitrator and the landlord appointed an arbitrator, and the decision was arrived at in a most satisfactory manner without any question at all of calling in the umpire, who, of course, had been provided for. He did not think that cases involving amounts of perhaps &#x00A3;40,000 or &#x00A3;50,000 should be left to one individual to guide the Court, particularly where the landlord might be a most unwilling seller. It was quite true what Lord MacDonnell had said a few moments ago, that the principle of compulsion to a limited extent for the purpose of relieving congested districts was carried by their Lordships by a large majority. That was the fact, and the reason for it was not very far to seek. It was not from any love of compulsion; it was not, he believed, in the case of many noble Lords sitting on his side of the House from any conviction that compulsion would be necessary; but it was, he believed, because there was a feeling that with the large sacrifices which had been exacted from this country and with the still larger sacrifices which had been exacted from those who owned land in Ireland in order to produce something like finality, there was no desire on the Opposition side of the House to refuse a provision without which the Government had assured them there was no chance of finality under the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00494">The relief of congestion was and must be the first concern of those promoting the Bill, but he spoke the opinion, he thought, of every noble Lord on his side of the House when he said that although they had bean prepared with great reluctance to go the lengths they had done as to compulsion, if there was not going to be a perfectly clear
<col>134</col>
and impartial tribunal on the question of necessity, as well as an impartial hearing on the question of price, they would rather that the Bill was not passed at all, and that all the advantages of it which might be gained for the pacification of Ireland and for the peace as between landlord and tenant should be lost rather than a provision which was not, only so unjust but also so unworkable should be placed upon the Statute Book.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00495"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so far as these two rival schemes are concerned, I find myself in the unaccustomed, and to me agreeable, position of a critic, because at this moment my scheme, in which I may also be assumed to take a parental interest, is not under discussion. The two noble Lords, with their rival schemes, each devoted some part of their speeches to the question of how far the one might be indebted to the other in the framing of them. I will not attempt to enter into the question as to how far either or both of them are indebted to the Bill as I introduced it. There is a great deal in both schemes to which His Majesty's Government, I think I ought to remind the House, are compelled to take serious exception. We have never agreed to the abolition of the purchasing power of the Congested Districts Board. We see, of course, what is the intention and object of noble. Lords in bringing about that abolition&#x2014;namely, that there should be only one purchasing body in Ireland. We achieved in practice in our scheme a similar result by saying that there should be two purchasing bodies but that each should be confined within its own area.<lb/>
Now what is the result, in these clauses as they stand, of the handing over of the purchasing power to the Estates Commissioners? What happens is this. The Congested Districts Board go through the whole operation&#x2014;and this, of course, applies whether the purchase is voluntary or compulsory&#x2014;of looking at the land and deciding what they will do with it, and also deciding whether they wish to acquire it in the last resort by compulsion. They then send in a requisition to the Land Commission. The Land Commission, I take it, have to go over the whole process again with their own inspectors and make a fresh examination. That having been done the Estates Commissioners are placed in the agreeable position which few of us ever find ourselves in of being able to make a purchase with other people's money. The money comes out of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0074"/>
<col>135</col>
pockets of the Congested Districts Board, but the amount to be given is entirely at the discretion of the Estates Commissioners, and there is no provision for any consultation between the two bodies with a view of arriving at the price which the Congested Districts Board are prepared to pay. Therefore, the Estates Commissioners knowing that they themselves cannot buy at a loss, but that the Congested Districts Board may have no inducement beyond the general sense of duty, which all men exercising a public function have, to make the kind of bargain which they would naturally make if they were acting for themselves. Can your Lordships produce any instance in England, Ireland, or anywhere else of one public body buying land with the money of another public body? I think not.<lb/>
See what further possibilities of confusion there are. Look at the proviso to subsection (3). That provides that untenanted land must be taken in these particular circumstances to be divided up by the Land Commission for the purposes of relieving local congestion. That operation is to happen before the land is handed back to the Congested Districts Board, and therefore you not only have the double operation as regards purchase, but you actually have the particular estate being divided and administered by the two separate bodies. I think I am not speaking too strongly when I say that that is a positively grotesque proposition, and one which I can hardly conceive your Lordships desiring to retain in the Bill. With regard to the differences between the two noble Lords on the question of procedure, the noble Viscount who has just sat down expressed himself very strongly of the necessity of going through the utmost ceremony in any case where land was proposed to be taken compulsorily. The noble Viscount, I think, omitted one consideration which is germane to this discussion, and it is this. There is a difference between the application of compulsory powers by these purchasing bodies and the single application of a compulsory power, for instance, in England. Compulsion, I think it may be assumed, would follow upon the lines of purchase as carried out whether by the Congested Districts Board or the Estates Commissioners in Ireland.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, I think, imported a certain prejudice into the matter when he spoke of the abnormal character of
<col>136</col>
compulsion as applied to the West of Ireland. The noble Viscount on the question of arbitration instanced a case in which he was himself concerned when he was at the War Office. If noble Lords opposite and other proprietors in the West of Ireland are going to get the sort of terms which the War Office has been in the habit of paying, I think there will be a general rush to be compulsorily bought out, not only by noble Lords, but by everybody who has an acre of land in the West of Ireland. As regards the question of the tribunal, my noble friend behind me follows in his proposed Clauses 47 and 48, and also partly in Clause 49, generally the lines on which we propose to proceed in our Bill, and it seems to me that the three grounds of objection at the bottom of page 11 which he there embodies represent a reasonable form in which anybody whose land is proposed to be taken may lodge his protest.<lb/>
But there are one or two points in the noble Lord's Amendment, and also in that of the noble and learned Lord opposite, to which we take exception. We do not think that you will solve this problem if you confine your powers of purchase to congested estates in congested district counties. If you are not able to buy other than congested estates at need for the relief of congestion I am afraid yon will find that there will be cases, possibly many cases, in which special congestion will not be able to be dealt with. Then my noble friend behind me provides that the Land Commission should, after certain ceremonies have been gone through, make an order which will be eventually a transfer of such land to the Congested Districts Board, but if he looks at the proviso which I have just mentioned to subclause (3) of Clause 44 in the Bill, he will see that the two things do not run together, because there are certain cases in which the Land Commission are told not to pass the land to the Congested Districts Board, but to keep part of it back for their own purposes. We have always felt, as I have said before, that it is not reasonable to speak of such bodies as the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners as though they were ordinary litigants or ordinary parties, such as, for instance, a railway company, seeking to acquire land by compulsion; and when you speak of them as being judges in their own case, even by the surely harmless device of putting
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0075"/>
<col>137</col>
an Estates Commissioner on the tribunal, as the noble and learned Lord opposite proposes, you are, I think, going beyond what is reasonable.<lb/>
The noble Viscount opposite spoke all through as though the Congested Districts Board in desiring to make a purchase of this kind were in a position of a public company desiring to buy a piece of land for the extension of their works. The two things must not be treated as though they were identical. It is true, of course, that the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners desire to carry out the operations which are entrusted to them according to law, but in essence, as regards the operation of their minds, if not by their actual position, they must be expected to act judicially in such a case to a great extent, and it is not fair to compare them to people who desire to obtain land by compulsion in order to put money into their own pockets. And it is for that reason that it is not, in my view, reasonable to demand precisely those same safeguards over these compulsory purchases as in ordinary cases of purchase by compulsion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00496"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: In the evidence given by one of the Estates Commissioners, he said that they must be able to sell the land so as not to incur loss, and he added that the landlord might have to part with that land for less than it was worth to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00497"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I know the observation to which the noble Viscount alludes, and it is one which has often been quoted but the same Estates Commissioner said&#x2014;and I do not think the noble Viscount will contradict this&#x2014;that the landlord ought not merely to receive a fair but a generous price, and that the difference ought to be paid by the State; and that is what, of course, in the case of a purchase at a loss has to be done, and the Congested Districts Board are provided by the State with funds for that purpose. If it is only that point upon which the noble Viscount rests, I think he builds too much upon a mere <i>obiter dictum</i> which has been, I am certain, misinterpreted. We, I repeat, do not desire or expect compulsion to be exercised on a large scale, and we certainly do desire that those who are bought out by compulsion should receive a fair and reasonable price for their land. But we do not believe that in order to achieve that object it is necessary to go through
<col>138</col>
a whole series of proceedings, and to surround the transaction with the same fences and safeguards that might be necessary in the case of ordinary purchases by compulsion. Consequently, although I fully admit the efforts which the noble and learned Lord opposite has made to shorten and cheapen the procedure under his clause, and though I also admit that there is much in the clauses of the noble Lord behind me to which I am prepared to give adhesion, yet at the same time I should not myself, as representing the Government, walk into the Lobby in favour of either.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00498"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think some of your Lordships must have been asking yourselves during the last hour or so whether we were approaching some means of exit from the rather difficult position in which the House finds itself. We agreed that a certain amount of latitude of discussion should be allowed, and it certainly has been taken advantage of to a very full extent. I think it is true, as the noble Earl the Leader of the House said just now, that the House has virtually to choose in the first instance between the rival schemes of the noble Lord who sits on the Back Benches opposite, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson. Of course, there is a very important series of Amendments standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Dunboyne, but those are Amendments on the scheme of my noble and learned friend Lord Atkinson, and I think they can most conveniently be considered when we come to discuss the question in detail.<lb/>
I was interested to hear both Lord MacDonnell and Lord Atkinson impute to one another, with a certain amount of earnestness, that each had plagiarised the particular scheme of which the other was the author. All I can say is that I rejoice that it is so, because we all of us felt when these two schemes first made their appearance that there were excellent features in both of them, and if each noble Lord has been able to pick the plums out of the other noble Lord's scheme, I feel sure that we shall be thereby brought nearer to a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. The only suggestion which I venture to offer to your Lordships now is that probably the most convenient and the most expeditious mode of procedure will be that we should take as a basis of discussion
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0076"/>
<col>139</col>
the scheme which is now in the Bill&#x2014;I mean the scheme that was added to the Bill on the motion of the noble and learned Lord behind me. He has considerably amended it. He has, if I may borrow an expression from him, withdrawn some of the bushes out of which his own zareba was originally constructed, and I cannot help thinking that his amended proposals may form a very useful ground work for our operations.<lb/>
Now may I, in as few words as possible, state to the House what I conceive to be the effect of the amended proposals of my noble and learned friend? In the first place, and therein he is at one with the noble Lord opposite, he desires to separate that part of the procedure which is based upon voluntary purchase from that part of the procedure which depends upon the exercise of compulsion. I understand him to suggest something of this kind: The first step is that the Congested Districts Board must issue a requisition to the Land Commission. Thereupon the Land Commission are to take in the language of the noble and learned Lord, "all reasonable steps" to secure the purchase of the land which the Board desires to secure. Now, I take it that the meaning of the words "all reasonable steps" is that they are to do what any party desiring to buy land or anything else from another party would do, that is, enter into informal and reasonable negotiations, in which, of course, the question of price would certainly arise. The noble Earl opposite said just now that in his view the result of this would be that the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board would be acting apart, the one having no means of knowing what had been done by or was in the mind of the other. As to that, I can scarcely conceive that two public Departments entrusted with duties of this importance should fail to lay their heads together and to confer as to the proper steps to be taken. They would, no doubt, be impelled by that sense of duty which the noble Earl very properly imputed to them to take such a course. Well, if the negotiations thus set on foot proceed successfully, the Land Commission then acquire the land, and having supplied the necessities of any local congests, proceeds to hand over the balance to the Congested Districts Board to be by them used for the purpose of relieving congestion in other parts of the country. That, as I understand it, closes the chapter so far as the
<col>140</col>
voluntary purchase is concerned, and we then pass to the question of compulsion. Now what happens under the Bill as to compulsion? If the Board find that the desired land cannot be acquired at a reasonable price on their behalf&#x2014;and it is quite clear that in this case the Land Commissioners are acting on behalf of the Congested Districts Board&#x2014;if they find the land cannot be acquired at a reasonable price, it then becomes their duty to submit a scheme to the Laud Commission for the compulsory acquisition of the land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00499"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt for one moment? The noble Marquess contemplates that the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission will carry on negotiations, if not at the same time, at different times, with the possible vendor?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00500"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I gather that the initial negotiations would be with the Board, but it is quite a point that may require attention. Well then, the scheme having been submitted to the Land Commission, it is considered by them. If they are satisfied they publish the necessary notices, and then in case objection is taken there is an appeal to the tribunal, proposed by the noble and learned Lord, consisting of one Estates Commissioner, a Judicial Commissioner, and a Judge from the rota. As to the constitution of that tribunal, there is no doubt a great deal to be said, but the question whether or not an Estate Commissioner should have a place on it is a simple and concrete point which could be very easily discussed upon its merits. It is noteworthy that the tribunal contemplated by the noble and learned Lord has to decide as to there being any necessity to resort to compulsion at all, and that is a point to which we on this side of the House certainly attach very great importance, and it is a point which, in our opinion, is not so satisfactorily or so clearly provided for in the alternative scheme of the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell. The noble and learned Lord then gives an appeal to the Court of Appeal on law and mixed questions of law and fact.<lb/>
The only other feature in the scheme is that there is a separate appeal on questions of price to an arbitrator appointed by the Board of Works, unless the parties prefer that the question should be dealt with by the tribunal. I am quite prepared to admit that there may be preferable modes of dealing with this question of price, but I think it is a good feature in the scheme in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0077"/>
<col>141</col>
the Bill as amended that the question of price should be dealt with as a separate issue, and not mixed up with the other questions which will arise. That, as I understand it, is the scheme which now finds a place in the Bill, and that scheme for the present holds the field. If then we desire really to advance this discussion we should do well to make up our minds whether we do or do not accept that scheme as the ground work of the plan, and we can then deal with points of detail such as those raised by Lord Dunboyne. He has two very important proposals to make, one dealing with the composition of the tribunal, and the other dealing with the procedure to be followed in fixing the price. I think, if I may be allowed to say so, there is a great deal to be said for the noble Lord's proposals, and I shall be glad to hear them discussed. If the House is at all disposed to share my view, I would suggest that we should now proceed to the discussion <i>seriatim</i> of the Amendments upon the Paper, for I really cannot help feeling that if the general discussion on which we have embarked is allowed to proceed much longer we shall never see our way to a settlement of the matter before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00501"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the House will allow me to point out that the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, which he proposed some time ago, affords a complete opportunity of making a selection between the two schemes, because it is essential to and characteristic of Lord Atkinson's scheme, and it is alien to and subversive of Lord MacDonnell's scheme. Therefore, if Lord Atkinson's Amendment, which I am about to put, be accepted, it will be a practical selection between the two schemes. The Amendment is in page 22, line 12, after the word "land," to insert the words "otherwise than by the exercise of the compulsory powers by this Act conferred upon them." The question is that these words be here inserted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00510">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00511"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> moved to insert the following new Clause 45: "Where any untenanted land has been acquired by the Board before the passing of this Act, or by the Land Commission on the requisition of the Board under this Act, the Board may retain the same and lot it, or any portion thereof, to the Department for the purpose of establishing an experimental farm for the relief of congestion by the training of probationary occupiers, instead of selling the same as hereinafter provided; and the Department may hold such land for this purpose and set aside such portions thereof
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0078"/>
<col>143</col>
as they think fit as allotments for such probationary occupiers during their period of training."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00512">He said this was the Amendment to which he alluded when he withdrew his Amendment on the previous evening on an earlier clause. This was the substantive proposal which he had to make, and the main portion of the scheme which he had to lay before the House. He could have wished that this Amendment had fallen into abler hands than his own, and had been advocated more influentially. Migration as a remedy for congestion was at once so important and at the same time was surrounded with such difficulties that he trusted no apology was needed for bringing before the House an aspect of that system which had not hitherto, be thought, engaged the attention of the House. The scheme embodied in his Amendment originated with Sir Horace Plunkett, and was based upon that gentleman's experience of nearly twenty years in the work of the Congested Districts Board. Whatever credit attached to the idea was entirely Sir Horace Plunkett's, but he (Lord Monteagle) alone was responsible for the form in which it was now proposed, as his right hon. friend was in America and he had had no opportunity of consulting him on the form of the Amendment before he sailed for the States.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00513">The details of his Amendment might be crude and the drafting defective, but he hoped that at all events it presented to the House in a fairly definite form the main principle which he wished to submit for consideration. It would afford at any rate a basis for discussion, and elicit the opinions of others more experienced and abler than himself. During these debates they had had frequent criticisms from noble Lords on the Opposition side of the House on the system of migration, and many of those had proceeded from noble Lords like Lord Ashtown, whom he now saw in his place, who had great experience in the West of Ireland. Only on the previous day in the columns of a newspaper he observed a most able letter from his noble friend putting forward the case against migration from his point of view in a very convincing manner. He must say that, to a large extent he agreed with Lord Ashtown. If no sort of migration were possible except in the form in which it had hitherto been practised, he would be very much disposed to agree with
<col>144</col>
the noble Lord and to despair of migration as a solution. But though he was far from regarding migration as a panacea, he thought that it had to be tried, that it was the one solution that had been put forward of this great difficulty, and they could not afford to lay it aside until it had been given a fair trial in the most practical form in which it could be presented.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00514">Migration pure and simple, he agreed, was an entire delusion, but he thought Sir Horace Plunkett had shown a way in which migration might be adopted on probationary lines free from defects which he fully appreciated in common with his noble friend Lord Ashtown. The first difficulty which Lord Ashtown had so clearly pointed out was that the congests when they were brought on to the land had had no experience; they had no capital and no knowledge of agriculture. There was a still more serious difficulty, and that was that in the circumstances under which they were now living their surroundings did not give rise to those developments of character which were essential for the successful treatment of small farms under the conditions which would prevail in the West of Ireland, or, he might say, in any part of Ireland. Another difficulty to which he thought his noble friend Lord Ashtown did not allude, though he believed the noble Lord would not disagree with him, was that migration as practised now merely struck the land and cut it up in a sort of chessboard fashion; it set up a dead level of small holdings throughout the district which was operated over. That was the greatest blot on the system. He agreed that it was most important they should have large farms and large farmers who would act as pioneers of agriculture, like the noble Lord himself, who was, he was sure, doing a very great work in the West of Ireland in that capacity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00515">It was most important, as he had said, that they should have large farms. He thought also that there should be some period of probation before a congest was put in possession and made the absolute owner of a holding, and the essence of the proposal which he had endeavoured to embody in his clause was that an experimental farm should be established. He would not labour the question whether it should be administered by the Congested District Board or by a Department. The details could be argued afterwards; but he
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0079"/>
<col>145</col>
proposed that an experimental farm should be established on which the congests should be employed as labourers, with allotments attached, and that they should be given instruction under the particular Department which had the charge of the experiment. This farm might be of some 2,500 acres. That was the tract of land which Sir Horace Plunkett suggested should be acquired for the purpose, and it would eventually accommodate about one hundred families. It would have to be worked in the first place as a grazing farm, and allotments from the first might be given to the labourers, so that they should have an opportunity of learning and practising on those allotments the working of a small farm, as well as seeing on the large farm the improved methods which could only be resorted to on a large scale. In addition to that, they might be given a share of the grazing on co-operative principles such as were advocated in the Report of the Dudley Commission and also years ago by the late O'Conor Don, and which were practised in a few cases already in the West of Ireland where co-operative grazing societies were in existence. This, in brief, was an outline of the scheme that Sir Horace Plunkett had suggested.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00516">Small holdings would gradually grow out of the allotments, and the scheme would thus provide, not only for the policy which he had suggested as a necessary condition, but also for an amount of elasticity by which the holdings might assume a more natural size instead of being prescribed beforehand in a rigid manner. He would expect to hear criticisms of his proposals in detail. One criticism that he rather expected was that the congests would not go to such a settlement at all. Well, he was afraid that that applied to every scheme of migration that could be propounded at the present time; there was very grave doubt whether congests would go on to this land, but it was not only the intimidation of the Irish League that the congests feared. In many cases the congests had hesitated, and not unnaturally, before the cattle-driving and agitation on the part of the landless men arose; they hesitated to take a small farm because, small as it was, it was much larger than anything they had been accustomed to before, and they did dread, he was told in many cases, the responsibility of paying rent for a piece of land which was larger than they had
<col>146</col>
previously held. Therefore, he did not think that that objection need prevail against his proposal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00517">Perhaps he would be told that the farm he proposed should be under the management of a Department. Well, possibly the Congested Districts Board would be the better body for the purpose. He was quite open to reason on that point, and he could see there would be certain advantages in having the two experiments because, of course, migration would be going on on other lines as well. This would be only a single experiment, and that the two should be going on at the same time need not involve competition between two public bodies in this matter. But the reason he had for suggesting the Department was that the Department had at the back of it the Agricultural Board and the Council of Agriculture, two popularly elected or representative bodies with a good broad back that embraced the whole of Ireland. That was a very important matter in this case, because there was no doubt that to solve this difficult question of migration it was most essential that they should have behind them an enlightened public opinion, and a public opinion that was not merely confined to congested districts but came from the whole country. Therefore, there was something to be said perhaps for having the scheme entrusted, if it should be adopted, to a Department.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00518">But probably the final objection that he would be met with, after what had fallen from his noble friend Lord Ashtown, was that this was not practicable, that Sir Horace Plunkett and himself were mere faddists and idealists, and that this scheme would not work. Well, he put it to the House, what were they going to do? The relief of congestion had to be faced. Migration was the only remedy, except the one suggestion of Lord Ashtown's which he would allude to in a moment. Migration was the only remedy, and, as Sir Horace Plunkett had pointed out, it was a futile remedy unless it was tried on probationary lines. It would surely break down if the congests were simply dumped down upon the land without preparation. He desired to refer to one suggestion which Lord Ashtown made in a previous debate, and he alluded to it in his letter also. Lord Ashtown said that the only real remedy for congestion was
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0080"/>
<col>147</col>
by employing the people. If there were any prospect of employing the people where they were, without migration, he thought they would jump at it. It bad been said by Lord Ashtown that granite quarries might provide a solution in one district. He agreed with that. He went further and said he thought something might be done by way of afforestation in another district, but he was convinced that there were vast tracts of land that could not be touched in this way. They had no men of position and of capital and of public spirit like Lord Ashtown in other districts to employ the people except on farming, and farming in some shape or form ill most districts would be the only resource. Therefore he came back to the simple question of principle&#x2014;was not some probationary system a necessary condition of successful migration? If the House adopted that principle, he had no doubt that it could be given effect to in some way or other. If, on the other hand, after the principle had been adopted and the plan put into operation it failed, as his practical friends, he supposed, would tell him it would fail, they would, at any rate, have tried a conclusive experiment; they would have given migration the very best chance it could have, and if it failed it would be time enough then to look for other solutions.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00521"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member> said that his noble friend Lord Monteagle wanted to migrate a hundred families on 2,500 acres of land. He supposed the noble Lord wanted to keep them there for five or six years. If he migrated a hundred families in that time, how long would it take to migrate the whole of the people in the congested districts? He thought it would take two lives.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00523"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member> said the noble Lord wanted to try his experiment with one hundred families, and he would have to train those families in some way. If they only did this every five or six years, he fancied that migration would not go on at all during two life times. From Galway to Connemara there was employment for men as labourers in the quarries at work which they were able to perform, and he would far rather see these men labouring than see them put on the land, because many of them had no idea of farming at all. If this scheme was to be carried out, the Congested Districts Board would first of all have to take care that they had got the right sort of land upon which to carry it out. Unfortunately, from what he had seen of the Congested Districts Board, they always seemed to buy the worst land for migration. There were six farms close by his place which the Board had had since 1904, and on which no one could make a profit by tilling.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00524"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that nobody had a higher respect for Sir Horace Plunkett than he had, and nobody more admired the enthusiasm with which he sought the good of Ireland. Sir Horace had often spoken to him about this scheme, and upon one occasion he (Lord MacDonnell) brought it before the Congested Districts Board with a view to their considering it. There was a good deal of sympathy for the scheme, but it was thought that it was really a case of trying to roll back the Atlantic with a mop. Lord Ashtown had said, the noble Lord who proposed this Amendment only proposed to try this scheme with a hundred families. In order to carry out migration effectively they had to deal with 20,000 families. If they dealt with them, allowing each family ten acres per head, they would have to acquire 200,000 acres. It was doubtful whether there were 200,000 acres of untenanted land in the whole of the West of Ireland available for the Congested Districts Board. It was thought desirable that they should try this scheme on a small scale, and the Board were willing to try it on a small scale. He himself, with Sir Horace Plunkett and another member of the Congested Districts Board, went down and interviewed the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0081"/>
<col>149</col>
Roscommon County Council with the object of setting on foot a scheme of the kind but it came to nothing. The people did not believe in it. His opinion was that it would be as well to try a scheme of this sort, and during the trial they might get certain valuable hints which might be useful to them in the wider scheme of migration; but to propose that no migration should take place until the migrants had gone through the whole course of instruction on an experimental farm&#x2014;</p>

They had certain money at their disposal, and he thought they could do it if they pleased.

Even if the Board were advised that they had not the power, this would give them the necessary legislative authority to make the experiment. His own belief was that they had the power already. He desired to say one word with reference to what had fallen from Lord Ashtown. The noble Lord had said that the Congested Districts Board, in his experience&#x2014;and no gentleman in the West
<col>150</col>
of Ireland had larger experience&#x2014;never bought any land but bad land. That was quite true.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00535"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said he thought that what Lord Ashtown meant to say was that the land which the Congested Districts Board purchased was not fit for tilling. There was a good deal of what was commonly called strong bullock land, most valuable for pasture, but not at all well adapted for tillage, certainly not for tillage with the light ploughs and small horses commonly used by small farmers in Ireland. There was a tract of land purchased in his part of the country which he believed Lord MacDonnell knew. It was fine strong land, part of it wet and all of it excessively unfit for tilling. Houses had been built on it, and it had been divided into certain portions, he forgot how many, but the whole amount was about 800 acres; yet the houses were empty and the land was derelict at present.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00536"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he was aware of the intense interest that his friend Sir Horace Plunkett took in this matter, and he thought there was a great deal to be said for such a scheme as the noble Lord had foreshadowed&#x2014;namely, that experiment should be made from time to time in training to a better system of farming some of the congests whom it was desirable to plant out. But the Congested Districts Board could do that already, and he would suggest to Lord Monteagle that it was impossible at this stage of this Bill to frame anything like an effective scheme
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0082"/>
<col>151</col>
for carrying into practice the idea that he shared with Sir Horace Plunkett. He did not think an Amendment of the kind suggested would be at all satisfactory to establish a system such as the noble Lord desired.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00539"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said that as the noble Lord accepted Lord Ashtown's statement he would not labour that point. He was quite with Lord Monteagle with regard to this suggestion for allowing congests to learn something of farming before they were put on a farm, because that was what it amounted to. Sir Horace Plunkett was an old friend of his own, and he thought the idea was a most excellent one. Lord Atkinson said it was impossible to put this in the Bill. On another clause they had been for an hour and a-half listening to the possibilities of putting into this Bill enormous things of a nature which commended themselves to the noble and learned Lord, but when Lord Monteagle proposed a very moderate suggestion he was immediately met by Lord Atkinson with the statement that it could not be put into the Bill. Of course it could be put into the Bill if their Lordships chose to put it in, notwithstanding the words of the noble and learned Lord. He hoped Lord Monteagle would, if their Lordships considered it right, deal with this matter at a later stage in the Bill, when he would be able to meet the criticism of Lord Atkinson, who seemed very anxious to object when anybody got up to speak upon any other subject but his own particular scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00540"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think there will be general agreement that anything put forward by my noble friend on the Cross Benches, Lord Monteagle, is worthy of the respectful consideration of the House, and more particularly when it is backed by the long experience and devotion to his task of Sir Horace Plunkett. But at the same time I am bound to say that I regret that if this matter was to be considered it should have come before us at the antepenultimate
<col>152</col>
stage of the Bill in this House rather than at an earlier stage, when we could have considered it a little more fully. In spite of what has been said by the noble Earl, Lord Mayo, I am inclined to agree with the noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Atkinson, that this is not precisely a fit subject for this Bill, for the reason that I do not know what there is to prevent the Congested Districts Board from starting an experimental farm of this kind and training certain people on it, and it is not our business in an Act of Parliament to direct a Board possessed of wide powers as to the allocation of particular sums which they should spend on particular objects of this kind.<lb/>
In speaking of an experimental farm for these purposes you have to be careful in what sense you are using the words. An experimental farm is used for the purpose of cultivation and the results of a particular year's work go far beyond the particular area of the farm itself. Certain experiments are tried in growing crops produced by particular manures, or in growing crops under special conditions which are of permanent value, but I do not see how the so-called results of an experiment of this kind would have any effect on anybody but the particular set of people who might he under it at the moment, and therefore to speak of it as an experiment seems to me to be a misnomer. You are trying on a very small scale something which you think ought to be done on a larger scale. I do not deny that to plant a number of migrants, men who have been only used to a very special kind of small cultivation and that sometimes of a rather intermittent character, upon land of an entirely different kind, and to ask them to engage successfully in a different sort of cultivation is expecting too much. If any method of this kind could be carried out on a large scale I should welcome it, but it seems to me that the cost of applying this sort of education to anything like the whole body of people, whom you propose to migrate would be altogether prohibitive. And bearing in mind what I said as to the small value of the proceeding as an experiment, I confess I am not very hopeful of any large results following from it.<lb/>
With regard to what fell from the noble Lord opposite, Lord Ashtown, as to the proper solution of congestion being the establishment of industries, I certainly agree with him, and I would welcome such a
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0083"/>
<col>153</col>
thing beyond anything else. Far better, if you could do it, to multiply the industrial classes in Ireland, than to multiply the agricultural class. There are quite enough fanners in Ireland already. I think we should all, speaking generally, agree that there are not enough people engaged in industry. That, of course, is a subject which deserves the close attention both of Government and of those who embark in any private enterprise of the kind, because it is quite clear, whether it is a question of quarries or anything else, that unless it can be put on a commercial basis it would be useless to attempt to open out the country in that way on a large scale. I am afraid I cannot advise the House to insert my noble friend's Amendment in the Bill, partly for the technical reason that his early clause involves the special allocation of money, and also on the ground that I think this experiment, if it is to be tried and if it is right to call it an experiment, must be tried by the bodies concerned on their own responsibility with the large public funds at their disposal. I hope my noble friend will not think that I am lacking in sympathy with his proposal, but I do not think it would be wise at this stage to insert the clause in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00568">He said he considered this clause one of the most important, because if it were their Lordships' desire that congestion should be relieved in the West it was essential that the congested districts in the West should pass under the control of the Congested Districts Board and that the untenanted land in Connaught should be ear-marked for the relief of congestion. If they perpetuated the existing practice whereby a landlord might contract to sell his congested estates to his tenants the result would be that the Congested Districts Board would be unable to intervene to relieve congestion on that estate. The tenants would become the owners of their holdings and it would be found impossible, as it had already been found impossible by the Congested Districts Board to come to an agreement with each individual tenant that he should waive his interests in his particular holding and submit to all the holdings in the estate being lumped together, pooled, and so redistributed that each tenant might obtain a holding within a ring fence. Therefore unless these estates were sold to the Board it was practically impossible that congestion within the particular district could be relieved. In the same way, unless they ear-marked the untenanted land in the West of Ireland for the relief of congestion anything like migration of tenants and the redistribution of their holdings amongst those who remained would become equally impossible.</p>

However that might be, however their Lordships might regard that point, one conclusion was certain&#x2014;a conclusion come to with complete unanimity by the Dudley Commission.

was the finding of the Dudley Commission. He (Lord Langford) admired very much the labours of that Commission, and, more especially, the labours of the noble Earl who presided, but he could not forget the fact that the Dudley Commission did not in any way represent the landlords of Ireland. He would go further and say that anybody who saw the witnesses and heard the very pointed way in which questions were put, both in examination and cross-examination, could come to no other conclusion than that the idea of compulsion was put before them in such a manner that they could not help answering the questions in a certain way. This large Commission went into the West of Ireland with a great deal of advertisement, and in Ireland they knew very well from experience what inspections and what Commissions meant. The whole countryside was agitated and said, "What are we going to get out of tills?" That was exactly the condition of things. Although the noble Lord quoted the Commission he did not follow the Commission in all its findings. One of the findings of the Dudley Commission was that the landless man should be put aside, the special point being that the migrants should come first. The noble Lord could not deny that.</p>

He believed the clause was not in the Bill in the first instance&#x2014;that it was a new clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00579"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is a Government clause. It is Clause 60 in somewhat different terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00580"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member> said the Government also did not act quite on the findings of the Dudley Commission and had got a little bit wide of the mark. It was a monstrous clause to try and put into the Bill. As owners in Ireland they did deserve a little pity and sympathy. By this clause they were once more to have their hands tied behind their back.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00581"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member> regarded the clause as impracticable. In Galway half at least of the land was not fit for division, and it was perfectly hopeless to expect
<col>160</col>
to divide it. It had a soft sub-soil on which no heavy beast could live during the winter, and stock had to be moved to the West to escape it. As for trying tillage, he himself had tilled for twenty years and had only obtained a good harvest in two years. He did not think it would pay any one to grow corn. He was afraid the members of the Dudley Commission knew very little about agriculture. He was cross-examined by them and it struck him that they knew nothing about it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00582"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> failed to see where the clause inflicted hardship on landowners. There was a real case made out for such a provision. The effect of the clause would be to prevent a landowner selling direct to his tenant. Surely the landowner might expect to get as good a price from a Board purchasing from him as from a tenant? Any one who was interested in the relief of congestion in the West of Ireland would know that there was a real need for such a provision. Travelling through the congested districts they would find cases where congested estates had been sold direct to the tenants with the result that congestion was stereotyped for ever. They would find an estate which had been sold to the Board and which had been improved, as also had the condition of the people living on the estate; and close by an estate which had been sold direct to the tenants without any Government Department coming in to help the tenants, who lived on in a state of congestion. He maintained that a case had been made out for such a provision as that proposed by Lord MacDonnell, and hoped their Lordships would not believe there was any real hardship in asking owners not to sell in such a way that tenants might not be benefited by the intervention of a public Department.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00583"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said landlords were to be absolutely precluded from selling their land, except to the Estate Commissioners. It was not only a question of congested estates, but dealt with untenanted land. That might apply to places like the Plains of Boyle in Roscommon where there were hundreds of acres of grass land with no sort of congestion. A landlord was to be deprived of the right to dispose of such land as he thought fit and was to be absolutely prohibited from selling, except to the Commissioners. Then they were told there was no hardship to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0087"/>
<col>161</col>
the landlord&#x0021; It was the most extraordinary proposal of which he had ever heard.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00584"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord, Lord Langford, expressed some doubt as to whether this provision had appeared in our Bill originally. As a matter of fact, it appeared in a far more acute form. Not only did we say that no congested estate should be sold but that no estate should be sold, and we founded that on the opinion expressed in the Report of the Dudley Commission&#x2014;namely, that if all the land in the available area could be secured it would not suffice to provide those who are now holders in the congested districts with an economic holding. The view noble Lords take of this clause is a good test, I will not say of their sincerity, but of the reality of their professions that the one thing in the world they desire is to see the congest put upon the land. We have heard a great deal about the landless man and of the danger of his getting an acre, but hitherto we have been under the impression that there was a real desire among noble Lords opposite to secure all the available land for the congests. What does this clause actually say? It does not say&#x2014;it would be very unfair if it did say&#x2014;that the Congested Districts Board would be entitled to tell a landlord that he must hold his land up indefinitely because it might, at some time or other, be wanted for the relief of congestion. That, obviously, would be an unfair thing to do. What it says is that he must not part with his land without giving to the Congested Districts Board the option of taking it, and the Board can say at once whether they want it or not. It is quite true that there is a great deal of land in these congested districts which is quite unfit for cutting up for the purposes of congests. Not only is there some of the fine grazing land which is too good, but also that class of land which looks to a casual visitor the most hopeless kind&#x2014;land where pasture is intermixed with rocky soil which looks as if it would not feed a goat. At the same time it has admirable qualities for the purpose of a large farm but is quite unfit to be cut up. The Congested Districts Board would at once say that that kind of land is not what they want.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00585"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member><membercontribution>: They asked me to sell it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00586"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord
<col>162</col>
must settle that with the noble Earl below him (Lord Shaftesbury), who was probably concerned in the transaction. There being this great problem to solve, where is the hardship to the landlord in the Congested Districts Board having the refusal of the land? I quite agree that if the Board, said "We cannot give you an answer now, but we will give you an answer at some future time," then the landlord would have an excellent case for the appeal which my noble friend provides. The noble Lord opposite said this is a "large order." Of course it is, but then this is a Bill of very large orders. It is a very large order for the taxpayers to provide &#x00A3;25,000,000 for the relief of landlords and tenants in Ireland in whom they have no material interest whatever, only a friendly and a moral interest. Therefore when we are told this is a large order I quite agree, and I reply that this Bill is full of large orders. We should regard as a serious matter the possibility of landlords within the congested districts, in view of all that has passed in this debate, rushing forward to dispose of their land by direct sales; and all the informed opinion in Ireland is, as I believe, in support of the proposal of the noble Lord in this matter. I trust, therefore, that your Lordships will agree to re-instate the clause in this form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00587"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said their Lordships had affirmed the principle of compulsory purchase. In a particular case the Congested Districts Board was authorised to call upon the Estates Commissioners to purchase a particular estate. All that was asked was that in respect of an estate in regard to which the Congested Districts Board was entitled to exercise its right of compulsory purchase, the owner of that estate should not dispose of it without applying first to the Congested Districts Board to buy it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00588"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: This clause was, I believe, deliberately rejected by your Lordships in Committee, and I cannot help saying that I think it rather unusual in cases of this kind to endeavour to obtain the restitution of the clause on Report stage. Of course, it may be shown that the clause dropped out <i>per incuriam</i> or something of that kind. The clause is one which would involve very considerable hardship and injustice. What it says is not merely that the Congested Districts Board are to be given the opportunity 
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0088"/>
<col>163</col>
of buying a congested estate or untenanted land, but that no transaction concerned with congested estates or untenanted land can go forward at all without the consent of the Congested Districts Board, who are therefore in the position absolutely of blocking any transaction of the kind. When you come to deal with untenanted land, surely it is a very serious thing that the whole of the untenanted land in these areas is to be, so to speak, tabooed, and excluded from the advantages offered in respect of untenanted land in other parts of the country.<lb/>
There is also this to be borne in mind, that we have considerably extended and amplified the definition of a congested estate. My noble friend behind me moved last night to reduce the &#x00A3;10 limit to &#x00A3;5, and I ventured, with great deference, to deprecate the course which he pursued. Of course I fully recognise there was something to be said for the smaller limit, but the effect of that has been that we have now brought within the definition of congestion a very much larger area than was ever contemplated before, and we are asked to say, with regard to the whole of that large area that these estates and untenanted lands are to be excluded from</membercontribution></p>

I should also like to ask this question in passing: If there are really cases of extreme congestion, where the holdings are so much below the economic level that the owners of them are unable to earn as decent livelihood upon them, would it not be the case that the Land Commission would decline to allow the transaction to go forward, that they would decline to declare the estate to be an estate in the technical acceptation of the term? I think that is really, in part at any rate, an answer to the point which was made by the noble Lord on the Back Benches (Lord MacDonnell), when be dwelt on the great evil of stereotyping these congested estates by allowing them to be transferred to the occupying tenants before the Congested Districts Board could have an opportunity of improving the size and condition of the holdings.</p>

He said that at the present moment in the scheme of Lord Atkinson there was no provision for inspection for ascertaining the price which the vendor would be willing to take. Objection had been raised, he thought, by the Leader of the House about the Congested Districts Board possibly suggesting a price and then the Estates Commissioners having to inspect and themselves put a price upon it. He understood the noble Earl to say&#x2014;he did not know whether he was correct, but that was how he understood it&#x2014;that the Estates Commissioners would have to buy at their price and that the Congested Districts Board would have to find the money, which was not quite a reasonable proposal. But he (Lord Dunboyne) did not think that was the case. As he understood the procedure, the Congested Districts Board would make a request to the Estates Commissioners. The Estates Commissioners, if they thought fit, would buy the land and pay for it out of the money which would be allocated in the funds to be set aside for purchase. It seemed to him that the money for purchase would come out of that sum and not out of what might be called the Congested Districts Board fund proper, which fund was appropriated for the purpose of improving estates and doing sundry other things in connection with the Board. What he had done in his Amendment was to provide for inspection of the land by the Congested Districts Board so that they might ascertain from the vendor&#x2014;not that they themselves should name the price&#x2014;but that

they should ascertain from the vendor at what price he would be willing to sell his land. In that way the difficulty would be got over of their offering a price and possibly the Estates Commissioners offering a different one. Unless the Congested Districts Board had the power of inspecting the property and ascertaining the price which the vendor would be willing to accept, of course it would be very difficult for them to formulate a scheme and get the necessary particulars that would be required by the Estates Commissioners before they would be able to deal with it. He thought the Amendment he had suggested would meet the difficulties which appeared to him in the clause as it now stood.</p>

I do not follow what the noble Lord said with regard to the procedure as between the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners. Does the noble Lord mean that the suggested procedure is that the Estates Commissioners are to buy on the statement of the Congested Districts Board without forming any independent opinion of their own as to price?</membercontribution></p>

whether it would be for the convenience of the House that I should deal with the other Amendment now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00598"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: No, I think we had better deal with this Amendment as it stands. That does not remove the fact that there will exist two separate sets of inspection and valuation, one on the part of the Congested Districts Board, a preliminary one, and the subsequent one by the Estates Commissioners. The noble Lord must remember this, that the Estates Commissioners have no power&#x2014;I do not know that any power is given in this Bill&#x2014;to buy an estate which they cannot dispose of without loss. That power is only given to the Congested Districts Board. What is the process in the noble Lord's mind by which the Congested Districts Board are to become the possessors of an estate on uneconomic terms? The noble Lord referred to the million of money which was going to be provided and which the Estates Commissioners were to have. But that is partly for their own purposes, for the purchase of untenanted land in the manner they have been buying it hitherto. There is nothing in the Bill, and no arrangement is laid down, so far as I can see, by any of the schemes, for their buying land in this way and handing it over to the Congested Districts Board for the purpose of creating holdings. I confess, although the noble Lord's Amendment is all right so far as it goes, it does not seem to me to make the whole transaction either easy or simple or even clear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00599"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said the first part of the Amendment was perfectly harmless. It merely provided that the Congested Districts Board might, with the consent of the owner, inspect land. He did not think it was necessary to make a statutory provision for that. There was no objection in the world to the Congested Districts Board going to a man and asking him how much he would take for his land after inspecting it with his consent. The last two lines of the Amendment, however, seemed to him to be extremely dangerous, because they provided that the refusal of the landlord to consent to inspection or to state the price which he would accept was to be sufficient ground for the Congested Districts Board applying to have compulsory powers put in force. It would
<col>168</col>
be perfectly consistent with the Amendment that there was some other land equally suitable which the Congested Districts Board could obtain. Yet because the owner refused to take their price they were to have this power of moving by compulsion. Though the owner of white acre might have land quite as good, the Congested Districts Board were, if the owner of black acre refused to take their price, to rush in and apply for compulsory powers. That was what the Amendment said, at any rate. Of course it was true the clause provided that the Board were to be satisfied that land suitable and sufficient for the purpose could not be got voluntarily; but there seemed to be an inconsistency in saying that on a mere refusal on the part of the owner the Board might apply to have compulsory powers enforced. Part of the Amendment might do no harm and might facilitate matters, but the latter part would be dangerous and afford a justification for the Board applying for the application of compulsory powers when there might be half-a-dozen other estates as suitable to be had without any compulsion at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00600"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether the noble Lord who moved this Amendment would think it well to accept the suggestion that he should move the first part of it&#x2014;that is, down to the word "land." The effect of that part of the Amendment would, I take it, be to permit preliminary inspection by the Congested Districts Board with the consent of the owner of the land, which would enable them to formulate an initial offer of some kind. But the latter part of the noble Lord's Amendment mixes up two things which should be kept apart&#x2014;the procedure to be adopted in the case of voluntary and that in the case of compulsory purchase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00601"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Undoubtedly that is so, because the clause deals only with compulsory purchase.

It seemed to him that when the Amendment was read with the context in the clause there was a perfect safeguard; but if that was not the case he would be willing to accept the suggestion of the noble Marquess to end his Amendment at the word "land."</p>

It seems to me to be a meaningless thing, as I said before, to state solemnly in an Act of Parliament that when a man agrees to have his land inspected he may do so. Supposing a man declines to have his land inspected. How are the Congested Districts Board to have an opportunity of acquiring any data by which they can demand to purchase that land compulsorily? It seems to me that, even if the statement as to the price which he would accept need not be left in the clause, the refusal to consent ought to lead to some further proceeding being taken.

<title>PART IV.<lb/> Compulsory Purchase.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00611"><b>47.</b> Where the Congested Districts Board are of opinion that it is desirable to acquire land for the purpose of relieving congestion in any portion of a congested districts county, by adding to the holding of any proprietor or tenant of a holding therein of a rateable value of less than ten pounds, such parcel or parcels or land as will, when added to such holding, raise the rateable value thereof, so far as the same can at the time of such addition be reasonably estimated, to the sum of ten pounds, or by providing a holding for a person who has surrendered his holding for the purpose of relieving congestion, and are satisfied that land sufficient and suitable for that purpose cannot be acquired on their behalf by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price, they may submit to the Land Commission a scheme setting forth the lands which they propose should be acquired compulsorily for the purposes aforesaid on their behalf, the extent, nature, boundaries, and condition thereof, and the names of the person or persons by whom the same owned, occupied, or used and enjoyed, the mode in which it is used, worked, or cultivated, together, as far as reasonably practicable, with the names of the person or persons to whom as a tenant or proprietor, or as tenants or proprietors of a holding or holdings of less rateable value than ten pounds, they propose that a parcel or parcels of the said lands should be sold, and the rateable value of such holdings, and also the names of the person or persons, if any, who has or have surrendered his or their holdings as aforesaid, and the nature, extent, situation, and rateable value of the same, together with the rateable value, so far as the same can be reasonably estimated, of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0092"/>
<col>171</col>
parcel or parcels of the said lands which they propose should be sold to each of the above mentioned persons respectively, with such further and other particulars as may be proscribed. An authentic copy of such scheme, signed by the secretary of the Board, shall be lodged in the offices of the Land Commission in the time and manner prescribed, together with a statement under the hand of the aforesaid secretary, setting forth the facts which, in the opinion of said Board, establish that the land sufficient and suitable for the aforesaid purpose cannot be acquired by voluntary purchase at a reasonable price.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00612">He said he did not for a moment imagine he would be able to persuade their Lordships to alter the decision arrived at by a large majority only a week ago. As one who imagined that the question of compulsory acquisition of land would not be entertained unless the Government made out a strong case in its favour he must confess that that decision came upon him both as a shock and a surprise, and this seemed to him a good opportunity of reviewing the altered situation which had arisen therefrom. If he might be allowed to use a simile, it occurred to him that the Committee stage of this Bill was somewhat like a long and arduous march along a narrow path beset on each side by pitfalls and morasses. As long as daylight lasted their Lordships walked warily and securely, but, as the shades of night fell, a will-o'-the-wisp appeared pointing in the direction of universal compulsion, and this phantom form seemed somehow to have the features of the noble Earl opposite, and their Lordships were thus enabled to resist its blandishments. But, later on, another phantom spirit appeared who bore a striking likeness to the noble Marquess who had so often and ably led them to victory, and the majority of their Lordships blindly followed into the morass of limited compulsion. There, he thought, they were still floundering, bereft of baggage and a portion of their valuables, only praying that when once they reached firm ground they might find they had some clothes left on their back.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00613">But, forsaking metaphor, he could not help thinking that they would have been wiser in following the noble Earl, because if the system of compulsion for the relief of congestion were once admitted it seemed to him that the wider the space over which the power could be exercised the better. It appeared to be a misfortune to confine the power to the poorest part of the country, with the result that almost all, if not all, the grass land in Connaught
<col>172</col>
would be compulsorily acquired, because he thought the Congested Districts Board were rather a greedy body. The result of this would be that by the splitting up of these grass lands the grazing industry would be exterminated in that part of Ireland, and the small tenants would be deprived of what he believed would be the greatest help to them in their new sphere of life. He wondered if some noble Lords were congratulating themselves that so far part of Ireland was exempt from this provision. He did not think this satisfaction would last for long. They had been told already that the amount of grass lands in Connaught was not sufficient to relieve half the cases of congestion, and they must remember that in addition to the other half of the congests there were also those friends of His Majesty's Government, the cattle-drivers&#x2014;he begged the noble Earl's pardon, he meant the landless men&#x2014;who would clamour even more strongly to be given some share. He felt convinced that it would be impossible in the long run, once this principle of compulsion had been allowed, to prevent it extending all over Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00614">They had been trying, so far as he could see, to make this compulsion as little obnoxious as possible and to try to find some means by which the owner who was compulsorily expropriated might obtain a fair price for his land. But they had still to hear from the noble Earl what was the basis on which he proposed that price should be fixed. They knew it was one of the chief blots of the Act of 1881 that no indication was given as to what was to constitute a fair rent. Numerous Royal Commissions and Committees had reported on that question. He was sure the noble Earl knew them better than he did. There were four Reports of Select Committees of the House of Lords, the Fry Commission, and various others, and they all dwelt on that defect of the Act. He thought it would be of the greatest importance if some definition could be put in as to what was the value to be given to land. He had asked the noble Earl the question several times but had not been able to obtain an answer, and he ventured once more to ask him on what basis it was proposed that the land should be valued. Was it to be on the value to its present owner, or the value it would have for the purpose to which the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board proposed
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0093"/>
<col>173</col>
to put it? There was a feeling abroad&#x2014;he did not know with what truth, although it seemed to him to be grounded on a certain amount of fact&#x2014;that the only reason for which compulsory powers were required was in order that the land might be obtained at a price below its value; and he would like to hear from the noble Earl that this was not the case, because it would be a great consolation to many of them who now felt very nervous as to what was going to follow.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00615">He remembered the debates on the Evicted Tenants Bill. There were two expressions which were almost <i>anathema</i> to the noble Earl. One was the reference to the Land Clauses Act and the other was "compensation"; but he was delighted to see the noble Earl had become a convert to that, for on the only Amendment he had moved on the Report stage the noble Earl had put in the words "full compensation." If some such words could be inserted to show what was to be given to the owner for the land taken from him he was sure they would feel that they had really obtained a more or less satisfactory solution of the difficulty. He dared say all their Lordships saw the cartoon in last week's <i>Punch</i>, where the charwoman of their Lordships' House was discussing political matters with the charwoman of another place, and he could not help wondering what would be the feelings of the noble Earl if it were proposed to acquire compulsorily his house in London for housing these ladies and their friends at a price they would be willing to give for it. Would he not much rather, if his house was to be acquired compulsorily, that the price to be given should be that which it would obtain in the open market? Perhaps the noble Earl would say there was no open market in Ireland, but he thought he could find purchasers for grass land if the privileges given to the small tenants were only extended to the graziers, in which case they would be able to sell at twenty-four and a half years' purchase on the rents now paid. He would appeal to the noble Marquess (Lord Lansdowne), who had felt himself bound to come to a compromise on the question of compulsion, to make it quite clear before this Bill left their Lordships' House that, whether it was lost or not, he for one would not be a party to any arrangement which would enable those who were going
<col>174</col>
to purchase the land directly or indirectly to be the judges of what the price to be given for that land should be. It would be absurd of him (Lord Oranmore) to recapitulate the arguments he had used against compulsory purchase, so he need not trouble their Lordships with them again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00616">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out Clause 47."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Oranmore and Browne.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00617"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said he would like to draw their Lordships' attention to the way in which Lord Atkinson's scheme was put on their Lordships' Paper. The scheme appeared for the first time on October 12. They had no intimation of such a scheme being put forward, and they had no time to debate it properly. It was brought on in that way, no doubt, for the best possible reasons. He proposed to follow the example of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, and take as the basis of the discussion the scheme in the Bill. The noble and learned Lord's scheme provided that if the Board were satisfied that lands sufficient and suitable for the purpose could not be acquired on their behalf by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price they might submit a scheme to the Land Commission. He would like to ask the noble and learned Lord on what basis the Board were to arrive at the conclusion that land could not be acquired at a reasonable price? Was it on the basis of what a reasonable price was, or was it on the basis of expediency? The clause also provided that after the Board had gone into a scheme, an authentic copy was to be lodged in the offices of the Land Commission. The Board had formally declared themselves satisfied that the land was necessary for their purpose, and also that it could not be got voluntarily at a reasonable price. No one could question in any way their decision on this latter point at any time. Then the Congested Districts Board came to their decision without inspecting the land, because they had no power to inspect it; nor had they offered a price because they had no power to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00618">With regard to Clause 48 of the noble and learned Lord's scheme, the Judicial Commissioner, together with two Estates Commissioners, had to inquire into the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0094"/>
<col>175</col>
merits of the scheme and, if necessary, proceed to acquire the land compulsorily. Then the Estates Commissioners had to publish a notice in the <i>Dublin Gazette</i>. He should like to know who in the West of Ireland ever saw the <i>Dublin Gazette</i>. They might as well paste the notice on the walls of Pekin for all the knowledge that would be had about it in the West of Ireland. The scheme went on to provide that similar notice was to be served as soon as might be on the owner or any one interested immediately after the publication in the <i>Dublin Gazette</i>, and before the expiration of the time allowed for objections the Estates Commissioners might send inspectors to see if the land was suitable. It seemed that no consideration as to the reasonableness of taking the land could enter into the report of the inspectors. It would be seen, according to this scheme, that there was no method of inquiry even suggested. There would be no production of evidence, and the procedure would be wholly one-sided. All that the three members of the Estates Commission had power to do was to see whether a case on first appearance had been made by the Board that certain lands were necessary for their objects. They had a right to look into the scheme, but they had no power whatever at this stage to say that it was an improper scheme to be carried out. Even if the three Commissioners were satisfied that the scheme was an improper one, compulsory powers must take effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00619">There was compulsion from beginning to end in the scheme. The three Commissioners were then to determine whether the land was suitable for the purpose for which it was sought to be acquired? This information as to the suitability of the land was not to be obtained for the guidance of the Estates Commissioners until after they had publicly given notice of the scheme. This notice could not be published until they had <i>prima facie</i> approved of the taking of the land. It was difficult to understand what possible inquiry was contemplated before the decision on the <i>prima facie</i> case was arrived at, even if the suitability of the land was not to be considered. The Bill said that if no objection had been made by any of the persons interested, or any such objection, if made, had been withdrawn, the Estates Commissioners might make an
<col>176</col>
order that on payment into the Bank of Ireland of the compensation for the lands taken, the land should vest in the Land Commission. That was the money paid for the property to be acquired. He must point out to the noble and learned Lord that no provisions were made for the allocation of this compensation, or as to the cost of making the title and the shifting of the charges. No doubt to the noble and learned Lord these were practically airy nothings. He (Lord Mayo) maintained, however, that these were not flimsy statements, although they came from him. They were facts which appeared in the noble and learned Lord's scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00620">If an objection were made it was to be heard in this way&#x2014;and if he was wrong he should be corrected, because it was very hard when the two noble Lords were discussing their rival schemes across the floor of the House to arrive at a knowledge as to what this Court was to be&#x2014;if there was an objection to the scheme it was to be heard by the Judicial Commissioner, one Estates Commissioner, and a Judge of the High Court. On paper that was a most formidable Court, but it was unlikely that the Estates Commissioner would stultify himself or that the Judicial Commissioner would do so by deciding in favour of an objector and thus undoing what had been done. It was also plain that the third member of the tribunal, the Judge of the High Court, could not possibly resist the opinion of his two colleagues who were fortified by the reports of their inspectors in this matter. The only points on which an objection could be made were the suitability of the land and the reasonableness of taking it. The price would not be objected to, because it could not be fixed until after the order of this tribunal and also of the Court of Appeal&#x2014;that was to say, if the objector did appeal. With regard to the Court of Appeal, in the noble and learned Lord's scheme an appeal was to lie from any decision of the tribunal on any question of law or mixed question of law and fact. Now the only points of law that occurred to him were either that the land did not belong to the man whom it was sought to compel to sell, or the question of a demesne. As to the question of appeal on facts, the Court of Appeal had no machinery whatever to enable them to deal with the question of facts.</p>

himself to compulsion pure and simple, because he had had an opportunity of laying before the House his views with regard to the noble and learned Lord's scheme. His reasons for doing this were, first of all that they had had no opportunity whatever, in consequence of the way this scheme was put on the Paper, of properly examining it. The Division took place and they were beaten; but they must remember, of course, what took place in the House of Commons, where compulsion in the Bill was resisted to the utmost by the Unionist party. He would like to ask the noble and learned Lord (Lord Atkinson) whether he was of opinion that his friends in another place were wrong, and whether he was of opinion that compulsion was so necessary that their Lordships, without having had proper means of discussing the subject, should be compelled to accept it. He (Lord Mayo) felt very strongly on this point. Lord Atkinson and Lord MacDonnell had occupied a great deal of the time of the House in discussing the merits of their respective schemes, both of which contained compulsion. Their Lordships had had the spectacle of two noble Lords who had not the smallest stake in the country in which he (Lord Mayo) lived discussing how and in what manner the property of Irish landlords was to be taken from them compulsorily. Some noble Lords thought that compulsion was necessary for certain districts in Ireland, but he and many others contended that there was enough land at present in the hands of the authorities, if they had money to pay for it, to deal with congestion as it should be dealt with. Compulsion, however, had been forced upon them, and he supposed they had to put up with it; but the action of the noble and learned Lord was to him one of the most extraordinary in his long experience of Ireland, and he could not understand the reason of it. Lord Atkinson was asked to attend the deliberations of noble Lords from Ireland which always took place before Bills of this importance came up for consideration, but he did not respond to the invitation. That action he should designate as akin to that of the "snake in the grass" and a snake was a live thing from which the people of Ireland recoiled.</p>

I candidly say that I dislike compulsion as much as they do. I am entirely opposed to the system of general compulsion, but I have been of opinion for a long time that it is difficult to resist the demand for a carefully limited and restricted form of compulsion&#x2014;compulsion restricted to cases where it is to be used for the purpose of relieving congestion, and where it is to be exercised subject to adequate compensation to be given to those who suffer by it, and only upon condition that the necessity for compulsion is to be decided by a competent and impartial tribunal. I believe that the Amendments which have been inserted in the Bill by Lord Atkinson hold out a fair promise that those conditions will be fulfilled.<lb/>
The forty-seventh clause of the Bill as it now stands makes it perfectly clear that compulsion is not to be exercised except in cases where it is a necessity to relieve congestion, and the following clauses set out machinery which provides appeals and which does not err for want of proper safeguards. If noble Lords should come forward with suggestions to make the safeguards more satisfactory, by all means let them put those suggestions forward and if they are reasonable safeguards I will give them my support. Lord Oranmore for example may be able to suggest to the House some means of making it perfectly clear that the question of value is to be determined in the mode that he recommends. On that point I shall be glad to co-operate with noble Lords; but when they insist upon the complete exclusion of the principle of compulsion I regret that I must part company from them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00629"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord somewhat transgressed the rule laid down by Lord Lansdowne that it was not expedient to discuss afresh on the Report stage matters which had been dealt with and disposed of in Committee. I make no complaint of that, because the subject is undoubtedly one of first importance. The noble Lord opposite objects to this very carefully limited and guarded form of compulsion contained in the Bill. Both Lord Lansdowne and I have been described
<col>180</col>
as phantoms who have been mistakenly followed through the morass. I do not know if the noble Lord himself can by any stretch of imagination be described as a phantom, but, if so, I can only hope that should he divide the House again noble Lords opposite will not follow him through the Lobby. But he is not a transient and embarrassed phantom, because we hope he may long continue to contribute to Irish debates in this House with the same skill and confidence he has exhibited hitherto.<lb/>
In one point I find myself in marked agreement with the noble Lord. In my opinion if the principle of compulsion is to be admitted at all, noble Lords opposite have made a great mistake in limiting the principle to the congested districts. It is quite true that it is within those arbitrary districts that compulsion may be most needed; but the comparison he drew is a fair one. So far as compulsion can be said to inflict any degree of hardship on the landlord, the landlords in those districts are no more responsible for congestion than are the landlords in other districts. Historically and economically congestion is not the fault of a man who owns land in Connaught, and if there is any degree of hardship inflicted upon those landlords it ought to be shared by the whole of Ireland. I believe that our plan of making compulsion universal is right.<lb/>
The noble Lord who moved the Amendment asked upon what principles land ought to be bought. The question will arise on an Amendment the noble Lord has put down to a schedule of the Bill. That has reference to the bonus, and upon that arises the question upon what principles the price of land is to be calculated when it is taken. I say without hesitation that in the case of parcels of untenanted land the calculation should be based on the fair annual value of the land to the owner. Obviously it could not be based on the possible use to which the purchaser could put it. On the other hand, it would not be fair to assume that the fair annual value to the owner necessarily represents a given number of years purchase of the rent he may be receiving at the time. That applies to all purchases, and one may be worth more than another. For instance, a great newspaper, bringing in apparently an absolutely fixed and certain income, is only valued for sale at three and a-half or
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0097"/>
<col>181</col>
four years purchase. In selling land in Ireland as in selling anything else, the degree of certainty is a factor to be taken into consideration, and subject to that the price must be representative of the fair annual value to the vendor.</membercontribution></p>

He thought the idea that an Estates Commissioner, who in the first instance had considered the scheme, should be appointed one of the members to decide the question was analogous to a Judge of first instance being called upon to sit as a Judge of the Court of Appeal to decide an appeal from his own ruling. That he regarded as a very objectionable procedure. When they remembered that in Ireland the work which occupied the King's Bench Court and the Court of Appeal was of a most trivial character in comparison with the work of the English Courts, and that matters of such magnitude as for instance the dealing with an estate the value of which ran into six figures would be performed in a perfunctory manner, they must agree that they ought to have a strong Court of three judicial members.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00661"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said this Amendment must be considered with an Amendment in the name of Lord Dunboyne to be taken later. The object of the two Amendments was to strike out the provision contained in the Bill as it stood, under which the compensation was to be awarded by a single arbitrator, and to suggest a scheme under which it should be awarded by two arbitrators and an umpire, to be provided by the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland for the time being. Lord Midleton had referred earlier to his
<col>186</col>
experience of a case connected with the War Office, where two arbitrators had worked in agreement; but if the noble Viscount expected two arbitrators in the West of Ireland&#x2014;one appointed by the Congested Districts Board and the other appointed by the owner of the land&#x2014;to come to an agreement such as might obtain in the War Office, he would be bound to be most bitterly disappointed. In these cases the two arbitrators would light and have to appeal to the umpire. He (Lord Atkinson) thought the Amendment would give a wholly unnecessary and most disturbing addition to the tribunal. In every case the arbitrator was to be appointed by the Lord Chief Justice. He had the utmost admiration for the Lord Chief Justice, but he was not sure that that gentleman was brought into contact with men suitable to arbitrate in such matters. The Board of Works were constantly in contact with such people and would be equally independent, and their choice would doubtless be more satisfactory.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00662"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> desired to say a few words in vindication of the character of arbitrators in Ireland. He thought the noble and learned Lord had done a great injustice to those gentlemen when he reflected upon their impartiality in the matter of arbitrations in the West of Ireland. There was an almost universal consensus of opinion on the part of all classes of Irish people as to the fair conduct of arbitrators. This was a question of dealing with the money of the taxpayers and not merely a question between landlord and tenant. It dealt with money to be found by a public authority in the legitimate and fair purchase of an estate, and he could not believe that two men would take views necessarily as asunder as the poles. But, even if that were so, it fortified their case in asking for an umpire. He certainly thought that the whole gist of Lord Atkinson's speech supported the Amendment of Lord Dunboyne, and showed that in the case of an estate worth &#x00A3;50,000 or &#x00A3;100,000, its distribution should not be allowed to rest on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of one man. He hoped the Amendment would be carried to a Division.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00663"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> said Lord Atkinson had dealt with his second Amendment which had not yet been moved. If it could be dealt with in that manner he was willing to debate it. He could not see any reason why if land was taken compulsorily in

<col>187</col>
Ireland it should not be treated on the same footing as land in England. The Lands Clauses Act provided for two arbitrators and an umpire. That was a very fair tribunal, with which people were content; and he did not see why the people of Ireland should be restricted to one arbitrator. In his view the umpire should be appointed by the Lord Chief Justice. There were two Bills now before their Lordships' House&#x2014;the Town Planning Bill and the Development Bill. In those Bills should any cases of dispute arise an umpire was to be named by the Lord Chief Justice; and he would suggest that in this Irish Land Bill an umpire should be appointed by the Lord Chief Justice in the event of the arbitrators disagreeing. He desired to to move his second Amendment in conjunction with his first.</p>

<col>189</col>
Secretary in the House of Commons. Lord Atkinson now proposed to omit that provision and to rely upon the possibility of getting the extra ten per cent He (Lord Ashbourne) was not so sure about getting the ten per cent. In recent Acts of Parliament provisions had been inserted that on compulsory sales there was to be no special allowance given because of compulsion, and in this Bill when it came to their Lordships' House there was a positive statement that no extra allowance should be given because the sale was compulsory. That, however, had been deleted. It was a big hope to expect that if they surrendered the possibility of the bonus they could rely with any certainty on getting the ten per cent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00680"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> was of opinion that the question of the bonus in the case of untenanted land was valueless. In all cases the twenty-six and a-half years purchase which would be given would be not twenty-six and a-half years purchase of the value of the land but of the value the Estates Commissioners put upon it, and if that was done it excluded the vendor from any bonus.</p>

I think it is hardly to be assumed that self-respecting public bodies would attempt in that way to evade an obvious duty put upon them by the Act. It is true that where a high rent is obtained for land and a large number of years purchase is obtained as well the untenanted land would not be subject to bonus, but I think it is not reasonable to assume that a trick of the kind described would be played by a public body. As regards the point at issue between the two noble and learned Lords opposite, I have no advice to give further than to say I hope it will not end&#x2014;in fact I may safely say my right hon. friend in another place will take care it does not end&#x2014;in a landlord not only getting the bird in the hand but also the two birds in the bush, because that would clearly be improper.

It was proposed by their Lordships to omit it altogether from the Bill, and the result of the omission would be seriously to curtail the extent of untenanted land on which it was necessary the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board should rely for the relief of congestion. He believed Lord Atkinson had an objection to the new clause, but he had endeavoured to meet that by the first few words "subject to the provisions of Section 50, Clause 4." With the addition of those words he understood that the clause would be acceptable to Lord Atkinson, and that their Lordships would consent to its restoration in the Bill.</p>

He said that Section 1, subsection (2), of the Congested Districts Board (Ireland) Act, 1901, provided that "Every such notice [that was, the notice issued by the Congested Districts Board to a tenant] shall contain an undertaking by the Board that they will within the period mentioned in that behalf in the notice or so soon thereafter as practicable provide the tenant with a new holding on the same or an adjacent or neighbouring estate." The preservation of these words in the section would clearly prevent the migration of

<col>193</col>
tenants to a distance. It was essential, according to that section, that untenanted land should be found for tenants in the immediate vicinity of the estate on which their holdings had previously existed. Obviously no large scheme of migration could be carried out under those circumstances. The Board undertook to provide for the tenant a holding equivalent in so far as value was concerned, and in every respect similar to the holding which it took up, and if the tenant was dissatisfied with such holding he had his remedy in a civil Court.</p>

His object was to gain some idea on what basis the Treasury were going to act. He thought the noble Earl would agree that the Treasury was a difficult Department to get money out of, and they ought not to put the Department in any temptation to restrict the bonus. After all it might be a matter of privilege; but it was for Parliament to decide the bonus that was to be given in these cases. To leave the matter to be decided by the Treasury after the passing of the Bill was hardly treating their Lordships fairly. He would like to suggest that the decision should, as in other cases in the Bill, be given by an umpire appointed by the Lord Chief Justice.

I said then that the Treasury view was that in this matter of the bonus the scale should represent the fair value to the landlord of what he was parting with. It is impossible to lay down a scale embodying anything like an average of rents received during a given number of years in order to get at the actual value. You are obliged to take the case on its merits, and the circumstances must vary between one case and another. I put aside the question which the noble Lord raised on a former occasion of an actual attempt to evade the obligation to pay any bonus at all by fixing an absurdly low price and an enormous number of years purchase as being entirely out of the question.

land in question, or might be derived from it. Admitting as I am inclined to do that the language proposed by my noble friend is perhaps needlessly rigid, would it not be well if we adopted words to the effect that in the case of the purchase of a parcel of untenanted land regard must be had in calculating the number of years purchase to the rent or annual sum which has been paid on the average?

I do not see any Amendment on the Paper dealing with the question to which I wish to refer, and possibly it is not one which your Lordships would think it wise to deal with by way of Amendment to the Bill. It has reference to a statement which was made, and which gave great satisfaction to myself and to many who are, like myself, interested in the prosperity of agriculture, by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill at the close of the proceedings on the Second Reading. I asked the noble Earl on that occasion whether he could give us an assurance that His Majesty's Government intended to make provision, in accordance with the undertaking given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the other House, that a quarter of a million, or one half of the Development Fund, would be assigned to the purposes of agriculture. Those purposes, as your Lordships are aware, are more precisely described in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of Clause 1 of the Bill which is now under the consideration of your Lordships' House. I may say that representations have been made to the Government by the most influential associations in the country interested in agriculture, such as the Lincolnshire Farmers Union, the Land Agents Society, the Surveyors Institution, the Central Chamber of Agriculture, the Farmers Club, the Agricultural Organisation Society, the Dairy Farmers Association, the Fruit Growers Association, the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester, the Rothamstead Experimental Station, the Agricultural College at Wye, the Horticultural College at Swansea, and the colleges at Cambridge and Newcastle, all earnestly petitioning before the Bill passes into law that your Lordships should see that some provision is inserted in it which will carry out the pledges we now understand His Majesty's Government have given.</membercontribution></p>

He would be glad if the noble Earl could inform him what precise meaning he attached to the words "or through a Government Department" at the commencement of the Clause. The word "through" was very ambiguous. Did it mean with the consent of the Government Department, or was it merely using the Government Department as a vehicle or channel for the advances?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00748"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: What is proposed is this. If any association of persons wish for an advance it has to go through a Government Department, and the Government Department are obliged to send it on though they may not approve of the scheme. They cannot hang up the scheme; they must send it to the Commissioners; but, of course, with the sending on of the scheme they would send their report as to whether they thought it advisable or a good or bad or indifferent scheme. The words are that the Treasury may make advances to a Government Department or through a Government Department to a public authority, college or institution, or association of persons or company not trading for profit. I hope I have made it clear that it must go through the intermediary of the Government Department, who send it on to the Commissioners, so that a person has a certainty of his scheme being considered by an authoritative body.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00752"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: That is so.

<col>204</col>
that his Amendment must be taken in connection with another Amendment which he had placed on the Paper to be inserted at the end of the clause providing for the particular cases with which he desired to deal. He did not at all wish that advances should be made generally to companies trading for profit, but he had had under his own control when he was at the Treasury the question of advances for light railways, and in deciding whether advances or loans should be made under the Light Railways Act for the construction of light railways this matter always had to be considered. It was reasonably easy to obtain some security from the promoters of a light railway that it should be made, but it was by no means so easy to obtain any security after it was constructed that it should be properly worked and maintained. He gathered that the intention of the clause was that in any case of an advance the application should be made by a public authority, and the case he wanted to deal with was where a public authority being a county council or a county borough council desired the construction of a light railway or tramway within its area, or it might be a grant for the construction or improvement of a pier or harbour. The public authority had to make the application for the advance; but could it under the Bill obtain from the Commissioners either a grant or a loan to a railway company or to a harbour authority for the purpose of the construction of the light railway, pier, or harbour? It would be obviously of great advantage in such a case, in fact it would be almost a necessary thing, that there should be some real security that the railway, pier, or harbour should be worked and maintained in the future; and what he hoped the Government might be willing to do would be to allow the Commissioners to make the advance in such a case although it might be made direct to a harbour authority or to a company trading for profit, provided the advance was applied for by the local authority for the benefit of the people in the locality. This matter had been raised in another place, and one of the representatives of the Government indicated that the Government were disposed to look favourably upon applications of that kind. As the Bill stood, however, he very much doubted whether such an advance could be made and any security obtained for the proper working and maintenance

either of the light railway or of the harbour or pier. He moved the omission of h words in this place with a view of the insertion at a later stage of the subsection of which he had given notice.</p>

What the noble Viscount proposes to do is to leave out the words "not trading for profit," and then, if I may be permitted to refer to his later Amendment, as the two hang together, he proposes to put in, "No advance shall be made to any association of persons or company trading for profit, except to enable a public authority to secure within its area the construction, maintenance, and working of a light railway by a railway company, or of a pier or harbour by a Harbour Board or Harbour Commissioners." As the noble Viscount said, Sir Samuel Evans in another place moved an Amendment which was almost practically the same as that of the noble Viscount's, but in view of the general opinion of the House it was withdrawn. In those circumstances I can leave it entirely and absolutely in the hands of your Lordships, saying for myself, although I do not press it, that there may be difficulties in regard to this clause to which I need not allude which might make it difficult for the House of Commons to accept it. With that proviso I will make no opposition to the Amendment, but leave it entirely in the hands of your Lordships to take out the words "not trading for profit" and to bring in the next Amendment, which, I think, carries out what the noble Viscount wishes.</membercontribution></p>

In the past, he said, there had been a great deal of wild talk about afforestation, and much confusion of thought arose from the fact that no one knew the amount of land that was suitable for the purpose. It seemed to him only logical that before money was actually spent on afforestation there should

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00769"><member>LORD LOVAT</member> said he could not agree to that course. His Amendment went to a survey of the whole extent of land that was suitable for afforestation. Lord Derby's Amendment only referred to the planting of certain lands which had been found after inquiry suitable for afforestation. He thought it was very necessary to make the inquiry indicated by his Amendment. If their Lordships read the Report of the Erosion Committee they would find that they had the very foggiest idea of the quantity of land available for afforestation, some people suggesting two and a-half million acres and others suggesting nine million acres. No scheme could be carried out without first ascertaining how much land was available. On that point, as he had already said, the most divergent views were entertained, not only as to quantity, but as to the altitude at which trees could be grown, and so on.</p>

the effect that this purpose should he defined by Order in Council, that the Order should lie on the Table of both Houses of Parliament for thirty days during the session, and that if either House presented an Address to His Majesty against it no further proceedings should be taken on the Order. In ordinary circumstances he should be prepared to give way to his noble friend, but on this occasion he felt bound to adhere to his own Amendment and to ask the House to accept it. He doubted whether there had ever appeared in any Bill a clause containing such wide words as those which he moved to omit from this clause. He very much doubted whether even the noble Earl in charge of the Bill could give them any definition as to how many fads, as he might call them, could be roped into that net. He understood from an Amendment he saw lower down that it would be perfectly possible, not only to buy land under which rich minerals were but to work those minerals; and if they were to take it to an absurd conclusion, there was absolutely nothing in the wording of the clause which would prevent any Minister if he sat on one side of the House from subscribing to some Free Trade union, or if he at on the other side of the House from subscribing to a Tariff Reform league, both being claimed for the purpose of promoting the economical development of the United Kingdom. He ventured to suggest to the noble Earl in charge of the Bill that the words provided too large a scope, and he therefore hoped the Committee would accept the Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00784"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that he put his Amendment on the Paper first because he did not think His Majesty's Government would accept the Amendment of his noble friend, Lord Derby, and secondly because he did think that there was some reason for giving the Government of the day the power of adding to the objects which might be aided, provided always that the control of Parliament was retained. The words as they stood in the Bill enabling the Commissioners to make advances for any other purpose calculated to promote the economical development of the United Kingdom were so vague as to be almost absurd. Practically Parliament would be asked to deprive itself of all control over the action of the Commissioners in dealing with the money which might be placed at their disposal, and therefore he suggested that any fresh purpose in addition to those which appeared in the Bill should be defined by Order in Council to be laid before Parliament from time to time, with ample opportunity for either House of Parliament to express an opinion in opposition to such a scheme if it desired to do so. Personally, he could see that the feeling of the Committee was rather in favour of the Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Derby, and he did not wish to press his view as against that of the noble Earl.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00785">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00786"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved to amend subsection (3), which provided that "no advance shall be made for any purpose which might be carried out under the provisions of the Small Holdings and Allotments Acts, 1908, upon any terms or conditions different from those contained in that statute except for some special reason which shall be stated in the annual
<col>210</col>
report of the Development Commissioners," by omitting the reference to the Small Holdings Act and substituting the words "any statute." As their Lordships were no doubt aware, the subsection was inserted in the course of the passage of the Bill through another place. The object of the subsection as it stood in the Bill was not to allow the advances which were permitted under the clause to run athwart the provisions of the Small Holdings Act. That Act, as their Lordships would remember, was passed with every sort of precaution. Certain elaborate conditions were inserted, which it was not material for him to enter into, and upon the strength of those conditions the Small Holdings Act was sanctioned. The House of Commons thought, and no doubt their Lordships would be of opinion that they were quite right in so thinking, that now that it was proposed that advances should be made under this clause such advances ought to be subject to the same conditions as those under the Small Holdings Act, because it was evident that if those conditions were good in the case of the Small Holdings Act they must be equally good in respect of advances made for small holding purposes under this Bill. But the principle which the House of Commons had established in the subsection ought not to be confined to the Small Holdings Act, because the same argument held good in the case of any other Act. For instance, he would ask their Lordships to consider for a moment the Light Railways Act, to which attention had been called once or twice. There were provisions in that Act for advances for the purpose of making light railways, provisions which had been very largely availed of in the working of that Act. As much as &#x00A3;200,000 had been advanced under the Act for the making of light railways. Those advances were limited under the Act by a great many conditions which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, must be assumed to be sound, and if they were sound they were good not only for the light railways but for advances under this Bill, and of course the argument might be extended to other Acts of Parliament. In a word, if the conditions under other Acts of Parliament for these special beneficent purposes were good, then they ought to be embodied in respect of advances under this Bill. His broad proposition was that the principle which had been assented to by the House of Commons in respect to the Small Holdings Act, in subsection (3),
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0112"/>
<col>211</col>
was a general principle of wide application, and ought to be applied to any Statute.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00788"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> wished to point out that the House of Commons had put in a provision in the Bill especially affecting the Small Holdings Act, which was quite a new Act only just beginning to get into working order, and therefore they might reasonably be expected to think that that Act should have a trial first. The noble Marquess had referred to the Light Railways Act, and had told them that Parliament authorised advances to light railways only under certain very strict conditions. Some of those light railways had been successful and some had not. There were districts in which light railways were desirable, but, owing to the poverty of the localities, advances could not be obtained under present conditions. Would it not be reasonable that the Development Commissioners should consider such cases with a view to granting additional advances?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00789"><member>THE EARL OF JERSEY</member> quite agreed with what the noble Lord opposite had said. There was no doubt whatever that some of the conditions imposed by the Government of the day in the Light Railways Act caused that Act to be less useful than it might otherwise have been. One of those conditions was that no money should be granted by the Treasury unless the light railway was worked by an existing railway company, the effect being that light railways were placed entirely in the hands of great railway companies. He need hardly say that the result of that was not very beneficial to the light railways, and after ten years of that Act he thought everything went to show that it would be a good thing if the conditions could be somewhat lightened. He could not possibly agree, therefore, with what the noble Marquess had said.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00790"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: There seems to be a difference of opinion about this, and that rather strengthens us in the view that the course taken in the House of Commons was the right one. The noble Marquess's Amendment is practically bringing back the Amendment that Lord Robert Cecil moved
<col>212</col>
in the House of Commons. The noble Marquess wishes to include the Light Railways Act in this clause, and that has been violently objected to by two noble Lords who have expert knowledge on the subject. Therefore, although I did not think at first that it was a matter of very great importance, I am of opinion now that we should stand by the words of the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00791"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> thought his noble friend the late Chairman of the Light Railway Commission and the noble Lord opposite had hardly sufficiently considered the words as they stood in the Bill, that "no advance shall be made for any purpose which might be carried out under the provisions of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908, upon any terms or conditions different from those contained in that Statute except for some special reason which shall be stated in the annual report of the Development Commissioners." If such a case arose as his noble friend behind him and the noble Lord opposite had in their minds, and the locality could not provide the sum required by the Light Railways Act, the Commissioners might themselves make the advance, merely inserting their reasons for so doing in their annual report to Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00792"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> thought that the matter was a rather more important one than it appeared to be considered by some of his noble friends. The doctrine apparently laid down was that whenever an Act of Parliament had been sufficiently long in operation to need some amendment, that amendment was not to be carried out by an amending Act but by putting unlimited powers into the hands of certain Commissioners. He spoke with no particular knowledge of light railways, and he dared say noble Lords were perfectly right in what they had said; but what they had said seemed to him to be only a reason for amending the Act of Parliament. The clause did not refer to light railways only, and it would mean giving a general roving commission to the Commissioners to modify Acts of Parliament as they pleased whenever Acts of Parliament had been in force long enough to have become practically obsolete. It was putting into the hands of bureaus of different sorts and kinds duties which had hitherto been carried out by Parliament. That seemed to him to be a very bad principle to establish, and he thought they ought to protest against it.</p>

If the Commissioners thought that they could assist a light railway by giving a grant which was not obtainable at present, there would be no harm in their doing so; but the Amendment would act as a warning to the Commissioners not to touch light railways.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00794"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> repudiated the suggestion that his Amendment would warn the Commissioners from touching light railways.

The Commissioners would have the indirect influence brought to bear upon them that if they were not to decide that a particular undertaking was of sufficient importance to lay before Parliament and it turned out to be so, they could be called to account for that; but their Lordships would observe that it was only a very mild influence which was brought to bear upon them by the proposed new subsection.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00805"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I should like to call the attention of the Committee to the words "magnitude of the undertaking" in the noble Earl's proposed new subsection. If it was really a big scheme the Treasury would have to go to Parliament for the money, because the Development Commissioners have only altogether &#x00A3;2,500,000 to spend in five years, so that the most they could spend in a year would be half a million. They could not tackle a scheme of any great magnitude with that small amount of money, and would have to go to Parliament with any large scheme. If noble Lords will look at the words of Lord Camperdown's proposal, they are "if a majority of the Commissioners consider that their proposals should be laid before Parliament they shall forward a draft recommendation to the Treasury." That means, of course, that the minority are opposed. If they cannot make up their minds about the merits or the demerits of a particular scheme, their obvious duty, I should have thought, would be to refuse to sanction it, and knock it on the head at once. But it seems to me that

With regard to the noble Earl's remark that the minority would be opposed to the scheme, there was always a minority in every case, and if the majority thought that the recommendation ought to be laid on the Table of Parliament, why should they not make the necessary motion? He asked their Lordships to accept the proposed new subsection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00809">On Question?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00810">Their Lordships divided: Contents, 99; Not-contents, 38.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00811">Clause 1, as amended, agreed to.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00812">Clause 2 agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00813">Clause 3:</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00814"><b>3.</b>&#x2014;(1) For the purposes of this Part of this Act there shall be established a Commission consisting of five Commissioners, to be styled the Development Commissioners and to be appointed by the Treasury, of whom one to be appointed by the Treasury shall be chairman.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00815">(2) Subject to the provisions of this section, the term of office of a Commissioner shall be ten years. One Commissioner shall retire every second year, but a retiring Commissioner may be reappointed. The order in which the Commissioners first appointed are to retire shall be determined by the Treasury. On a casual vacancy occurring by reason of the death, resignation, or incapacity of a Commissioner, or otherwise, the person appointed by the Treasury to fill the vacancy shall continue in office until the Commissioner in whose place he was appointed would have retired, and shall then retire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00816">(3) There shall be paid to not more than two of the Commissioners such salaries, not exceeding in the aggregate three thousand pounds in each year, as the Treasury may direct.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00817">(4) The Commissioners may act by three of their number and notwithstanding a vacancy in their number, and, subject to the approval of the Treasury, may regulate their own procedure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00818">(5) The Commissioners may, with the consent of the Treasury, appoint and employ such officers and servants for the purposes of this Part of this Act as they think necessary, and may remove any officer or servant so appointed and employed, and there shall be paid to such officers and servants such salaries or remuneration as the Commissioners, with the consent of the Treasury, may determine.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00819">(6) The salaries of the Commissioners and the salaries or remuneration of their officers and servants and any expenses incurred by the Commissioners in the execution of their duties under this Part of this Act to such amount as may be sanctioned by the Treasury shall be defrayed out of the development fund.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00820"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he had given notice of a verbal Amendment to leave out the words "part of this" in the first line of the clause with the view of raising the very important question whether a Road Board should be separately established, or whether the duties of the Road Board should be carried out by the Development Commissioners&#x2014;whether, in short, one or two authorities should be constituted under the Bill. It was rather difficult, he admitted, to raise this question now, because they did not know what duties their Lordships would impose on the Road Board; and therefore he would ask the noble Earl in charge of the Bill where he thought the question could best be raised. He would be quite willing to pass by his present Amendment, which was really almost a verbal one, if in the opinion of the noble Earl the point could be raised on another clause.
<col>218</col>
It did not seem to him to be advisable to decide whether there should be a separate Road Board before their Lordships had decided what the duties of such a Board were to be, and it might be their Lordships would decide that the power of making new roads, and of making them nearly a quarter of a mile broad, was not to be entrusted to the Road Board. If their Lordships so decided, the Road Board would be simply a body authorised to make grants to local authorities for the construction of new roads or for the improvement of existing ones, and he submitted that it would be quite unnecessary to constitute a separate body for that purpose. That work might be done either by the Local Government Board or by the Commissioners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00821"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I should almost think, if it suits the noble Viscount, that it would be as well to take the whole question at once on this Amendment, which is the first of a series of Amendments the object of which is to amalgamate the two bodies. I think the Committee should clearly understand that the question before your Lordships is to do away with the Road Board, to increase the numbers of the Commissioners, and to tack the powers of the Road Board on to the Development Commissioners. If your Lordships understand that that is really the question before you, I think perhaps it would be the most convenient and the best place to take the discussion at once, so as not to have any confusion, on the Amendment the noble Viscount now proposes to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00822"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that in spite of what the noble Earl had stated, he thought the discussion of the question would be rather prejudiced until they knew what the duties were which the Road Board had to perform. He would prefer, therefore, that his Amendment should be passed by at the moment, letting the clause stand so far as he was concerned in its present state, and when they came to Clause 7, which constituted the Road Board, to move the postponement of that clause until they knew what the duties were that were to be cast upon the Road Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00823"><member>LORD BELPER</member> thought that the suggestion of the noble Viscount ought to be adopted, as their Lordships did not know
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0116"/>
<col>219</col>
what the powers of the Road Board were or what might be done under the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00824"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I understand the proposal to be that we should pass by all the noble Viscount's Amendments until we come to Clause 7.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00825"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he proposed to postpone Clause 7 until their Lordships had settled what the duties of the Road Board were to be.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00826"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I confess I should like to understand how we are to do it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00827"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member> said he thought he understood exactly what the noble Viscount proposed. The noble Viscount had several Amendments on the Paper, one, for instance, being that two of the Commissioners should be selected for their special knowledge of the construction of roads, and so on, and, as he understood, he did not intend to move any of those Amendemnts at present, and when they came to Clause 7 the noble Viscount intended to move that that clause be postponed and that their Lordships should consider Clause 7 later. Then their Lordships would come to the powers of the Road Board contained in Clause 8, and on that clause the noble Viscount proposed to raise the whole question as to whether the Road Board and the Development Commissioners should be amalgamated in one body.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00828"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> agreed that that was his proposal. He understood that it would be possible for their Lordships to postpone Clause 7 and take Clause 8 and settle the duties of the Road Board, and then go back to Clause 7 and consider whether there should be a Road Board at all, it being understood that various preliminary Amendments should, if necessary, be inserted on Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00829"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member> moved an Amendment vesting the appointment of the Commissioners in the Crown by warrant under the sign manual, instead of in the Treasury. He said that one object of his Amendment was for the purpose of endeavouring to elicit from His Majesty's Government some idea of the relationship which was to exist between the Treasury, Parliament, and the
<col>220</col>
Development Commissioners. He had put down a series of Amendments which on the one hand would have the effect of considerably strengthening the Commissioners, and on the other hand would place them entirely under the control of Parliament. He candidly confessed that he was sufficiently old-fashioned to believe that anything which derogated from the effective control of Parliament over the finances of the country was a thing to be deprecated. He regretted that he appeared to be in a minority in holding that opinion nowadays. It seemed to him that the whole trend of modern legislation was to create new Government Departments and bodies which in some mysterious manner stepped between the vote of Parliament and the control of the finances of the country. He wanted to know what the precise relationship of the Development Commissioners was to be to the Treasury.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00830">It seemed to him that the idea of the Bill was that there should be a minimum of Parliamentary control combined with a maximum of Departmental responsibility, and it was a little difficult to understand why it was necessary for the purposes of the Act that such a body should be created at all. If these great schemes were to be carried out he much preferred that duly prepared and well-considered estimates should be placed before the House of Commons, that the House of Commons should have full opportunity of expressing their opinion upon them, and that the money should be expended according to the instructions of Parliament. The House of Commons had apparently seen fit to dispense with the control of a sum of two and a-half millions of money which was to be spent over a series of years. The control as to how that money was to be allocated and how it was to be spent seemed to him to be almost entirely taken away from the House of Commons. They wished to know what the real views of the Government were as to the functions and the duties of the Development Commissioners; and if they were to have an independent body at all, he hoped their Lordships would agree that it was better to have a body which was really independent. He had no wish to find fault with the procedure of appointment by Treasury Minute; in fact, he had had the privilege of holding an office the appointment to which was by Treasury Minute, and he would be the last person
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0117"/>
<col>221</col>
to suggest that in many cases that was not the most suitable procedure. But here a body was being created with, as it were, an odour of independence but composed of persons who, from the very nature of their appointment, could not fail to be more or less servants, of the Treasury, dependent upon their wishes and upon their views.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00831">For the purpose he had indicated, he had ventured to place upon the Table of their Lordships' House a series of Amendments identical with those moved by Sir William Anson in the House of Commons, and he hoped if they were carried that they would result in making the body a really independent one. Although the body might be composed of exactly the same individuals, yet, with all respect to Treasury Minutes, he ventured to say that a body of men created and appointed, as he suggested, by His Majesty, with all the dignity and formality of a Royal Commission, would be a far stronger and more independent and capable body than a body which would be recognised as merely a Departmental Committee appointed by the Treasury. The language he had adopted in the series of Amendments which he had suggested was practically that which was utilised now, as he understood, in the appointment of Judges. There was a further precedent for his suggestion. Under the Charitable Trust Acts practically the same procedure was adopted, and he failed to see any reason why a body which was to have such vast and comprehensive powers and the control of such large sums of money, which, although limited at present to two and a-half millions would be bound to increase largely if the procedure continued, should not be appointed with all the dignity and formality that he suggested. Such a body would be far more capable of fairly and adequately carrying out such a work than a body which must be more or less liable to Parliamentary influence. He did not say that there was anything wrong in Parliamentary influence being brought to bear in certain circumstances, but in the case of such a body as the one in question there would be the greatest possible objection to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00832">If the Government could not see their way to accept his Amendment, would they, at any rate, give him some idea of what their views were as to the relationship the
<col>222</col>
Development Commissioners would bear to the Treasury and to the Houses of Parliament? Even if they did not accept this proposal he would like to ask them a question with regard to one of the further Amendments he had placed on the Paper. If the scheme of the Government was adhered to, would it be possible for a paid member of the Commission to retain a seat in the House of Commons? There was some doubt expressed in the House of Commons on that subject. As far as he had been able to read from the reports of their proceedings, the Solicitor-General had expressed the opinion that a paid Commissioner would not be able to do so, but it was not an absolutely decisive opinion. He thought, as far as policy was concerned, that there ought to be a specific agreement that a paid Commissioner under the Bill ought not to be entitled to sit and vote in the House of Commons. He did not know whether it would be necessary to move words to carry that into effect in the Bill, or whether it was covered by the existing law. He would like to know the view of His Majesty's Government with regard to it, and would withdraw his Amendment on the point if necessary. Meanwhile he would move the first Amendment standing in his name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00833">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 3, lines 25 and 26, to leave out 'there shall be established a Commission consisting of,' and to insert 'it shall be lawful for His Majesty and his successors by warrant under the sign manual to appoint.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Duke of Devonshire.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00834"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: This point was very well thrashed out in the other House of Parliament. On Report, Sir William Anson moved a similar Amendment to that which the noble Duke has now moved, and there was a very long debate about it. The feeling of the House was very strong in favour of the present arrangement, and on the division the figures were, I think, 148 to thirty-two. There really seems to be hardly any necessity in this case why the appointment of these Development Commissioners should be treated in exactly the same way as that of Judges of the High Court. Of course, there can be no strong objection to the proposal of the noble Duke, though, as the House of Commons have declared their opinion with regard to it after a long debate on the subject, the Government would prefer to retain the words in the Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0118"/>
<col>223</col>
The noble Duke asked what was the view of the Government as to the duties of the Development Commissioners. I am sure the noble Duke does not wish me to detain the House by going into that question again. I made it as clear as I could in my speech on the Second Reading. But I must join issue with him at once when he says that though there was an odour of independence about them&#x2014;I think those were the words he used&#x2014;yet they would be the servants of the Treasury. I can assure the noble Duke that they will not be servants of the Treasury of any sort, description, or kind. They will be chosen for their integrity and honour, and they will be, what they were chosen to be&#x2014;the servants of the public at large. Perhaps they would not have the same dignity and formality and strength in their appointment as a Judge of the Crown appointed by His Majesty, but they would have the same dignity that most Commissioners created under similar circumstances would have. I cannot for one moment admit that these independent and honourable men would be in any way subject to Parliamentary influence or pressure. No man with any self-respect could undertake a business of this kind with any idea of suffering from Parliamentary influence; at any rate, not the men whom we hope to see filling these positions; and though there is no great objection, of course, to the proposal of the noble Duke, yet I hope, considering the expression of opinion of the House of Commons on the matter, that your Lordships will permit the clause to remain as it is.<lb/>
There was one more question the noble Duke asked&#x2014;whether it would be possible for a paid Development Commissioner to be a member of Parliament. The noble Duke has an Amendment dealing with that on the Paper. Perhaps I might answer the question now, as it has been raised. There is no possibility of any man holding a position of this sort being a member of the Commons House of Parliament. If he was a member of the House of Commons at the time he would have to resign his seat from the moment of accepting his appointment, because he would be holding an office of profit under the Crown, and since the days of Queen Anne no person holding an office of profit under the Crown can retain his seat in Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00835"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: This would not be under the Crown. It would be under the Treasury.</membercontribution></p>
<col>224</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00836"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The matter has been looked into, and this is held to be an office of profit under the Crown.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00837"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: On what ground?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00838"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry I am not in a position to argue the legal aspect. All I can say is that I am briefed, if I may use that expression, by the highest legal authority in the country to say that a man who holds the position of a Commissioner holds an office of profit under the Crown. That is all I have to say, except that the Government do not wish this Amendment to be carried. But, of course, having made our protest, we should offer no opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00839"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said there was an obvious convenience in the proposal of his noble friend to make the Crown the source of the appointment, because that would confer certain jurisdictions and powers which would not otherwise be conferred. If a person was appointed by pleasure of the Crown it was as high a tenure as could well be asked for, and, as long as he conducted himself properly, the pleasure would not be determined. But there might be public grounds which made it desirable that it should be determined.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00840"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> said that before the Committee accepted the Amendment he would like to know from the noble Duke opposite whether the other Amendments standing in his name were consequential or not. For his own part he had no very strong feeling one way or the other whether the appointment was by Commission established as in the Bill or by warrant under the sign manual of His Majesty, but he saw what he took to be a consequential Amendment on the next page to the effect that the Commissioners should hold office during good behaviour. This was a new thing, and it might be rather difficult to get five men who were really good at the business. The office of a Development Commissioner was going to require a special kind of man, and at the end of ten years, the term of office specified in the Bill, they would be able to find out whether a Commissioner ought to be retained or not. But by the Amendment of the noble Duke they were going to put in five men who were to hold office under the proposal perhaps for life; and in a few years time they might have a body of very old men, two or three of whom had shown their incapacity to do the work.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0119"/>
<col>225</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00841"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> confessed that he had not realised that the Amendment of the noble Duke behind him did imply that Commissioners appointed under the Bill should hold office for life. He was disposed to agree with the noble Lord opposite that if that were so it would be an objection. He had seen things himself in the constitution of the Railway Commission which induced him to think that tenure of office for a certain number of years was better than tenure for life. Whether the Commissioners should be appointed by the Crown or by the Treasury was another matter, and he gathered that His Majesty's Government had no very great objection to appointment by the Crown.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00842"><member>LORD WELBY</member> pointed out that an appointment by the Crown would practically mean an appointment for life, whereas an appointment by Treasury Minute would necessarily mean retirement at the age of sixty-five.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00843"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member> preferred that the Crown rather than the Treasury should have the appointment, but he quite appreciated the point that had been raised. He was quite prepared, therefore, to withdraw his future Amendment in that respect and have a limited number of years inserted instead.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00844">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00845"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved an Amendment providing that the names of the Commissioners should be inserted in the schedule. He said that on the Second Reading he ventured to ask the noble Earl in charge of the Bill whether he would be good enough to state on behalf of the Government the names of the Commissioners before the matter passed out of the control of Parliament. The noble Earl was kind enough to make a very sympathetic answer. He said it was not at all an unreasonable suggestion, and he would consider whether it was possible or not to comply with it. He thought that the easiest way of giving the noble Earl that opportunity was to move the Amendment in the form in which he had put it down, but it would be absurd to press it if the answer of the noble Earl was not a favourable one. If, however, it was favourable, he would ask their Lordships to insert the words in the clause, and then it would naturally follow that the names of the Commissioners would be stated in the
<col>226</col>
schedule. The control of very large sums of money, amounting to millions of pounds, was to be placed in the hands of these Commissioners, and their powers, even after the Amendment their Lordships had made to the first clause, would be very wide reaching. Such powers as those no doubt could be properly wielded by certain men and only by certain men; there were very few men who were really qualified to exercise them, and it would reassure their Lordships' minds very much if they knew who the Commissioners were to whom such enormous powers were to be entrusted. They were hardly giving any directions to the Commissioners as how they were to use their powers. They were in the position, he was going to say, of almost absolute monarchs, but certainly in a position of enormous independence. Of course, if they knew the names of the Commissioners they might be prepared to trust them with even greater powers.</p>

<quote>"In page 3, line 26, after the word 'Commissioners,' to insert the words 'named in the Second Schedule to this Act.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Marquess of Salisbury.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00847"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: When the noble Marquess raised this question on a previous occasion I said the demand was certainly not an unreasonable one, and I am still of the opinion that it is reasonable to ask the names of these men who, as the noble Marquess says, are to have such large sums entrusted to them, and whose powers are to be so far-reaching. There is one great difficulty about this, however, and it arises from the very fact which the noble Marquess himself mentioned. He said, and said truly, that the Commissioners must be very exceptional men and that it would be very difficult to find men so qualified. I quite agree; and that being so it would be most undesirable to make any hurried choice. I know that from the experience I had in the case of the Small Holdings Commissioners whom I was permitted to appoint. There were an enormous number of applicants, and had I been obliged to come to Parliament and hurriedly give names, instead of being able after careful consideration to give the names of those men whom I was fortunate enough to secure, the consequences might have been very disastrous. I have thought this thing over and consulted with the powers that be, and at the present moment it is absolutely impossible to give
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0120"/>
<col>227</col>
the names of the Commissioners, especially as, if the noble Viscount's Amendments are carried, the duties of the Commissioners will be to a great extent changed, and a different class of man, of course, would have to be appointed. I am therefore grateful to the noble Marquess for offering not to press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00848"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that if one of the Amendments on the Paper was carried the office of Commissioner would be made even more important than it was at the present time, and that was an additional reason for his noble friend desiring to know the names of the Commissioners before proceeding with the Bill. When he knew the House of Commons a good many years ago that House never would have parted with a Bill of this kind without knowing the names of the Commissioners who were to be placed in so important a position as the Commissioners proposed by this Bill. Nowadays there seemed to be a change of opinion, but he would venture to press upon their Lordships, in the interests of both Houses of Parliament, not to part with the Bill before they knew who the Commissioners were to be. The appointment was one of grave importance, and these men would be entrusted, practically without any control, to carry out very responsible duties. The least the Government could do was to inform Parliament of the names of the Commissioners proposed before the Bill became law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00849"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> said the noble Viscount proposed to move an Amendment later which would give the Commissioners control of all the roads. How could the Government give the names of the Commissioners when they did not even know whether they were going to have the control of the roads or not? It also seemed to him that the names of the Commissioners who had control of the roads would be different from those who had not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00850">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00851"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> moved to amend subsection (4) so that it would read "The Commissioners may act by three of their number, 'of whom one shall be a paid Commissioner,' and notwithstanding a vacancy in their number, and, subject to the approval of the Treasury, may regulate their own procedure." He said that he was in some difficulty with
<col>228</col>
regard to his Amendment, because it might have to be modified if the duties of the Commissioners were altered; but what he had to say might apply to one state of affairs as well as to the other. He thought that in public bodies generally the salaried officer almost always attended to the business in question, and from the nature of things was likely to be more conversant with the work than one who was not in that position. There might be arguments for and against his Amendment, but considering the extremely important nature of the work entrusted to the Commissioners and the great necessity that the public interest should be guarded as far as possible, he asked their Lordships to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00869"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member> moved to leave out subsection (4), which empowered the Commissioners to frame schemes with a view to their adoption by a Government Department or other body or persons to whom an advance might be made. He regarded the subsection as a rather dangerous extension of the policy of giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Commissioners. Every apprehension that was entertained on that side of the House applied to the clause with very much greater force because it changed and enlarged the whole character of the Commissioners. At the beginning of the Bill they were to be a judicial body, and in that character had very large powers indeed; they were able to range over the whole gamut from (<i>a</i>) to (<i>g</i>) as provided in the first clause of the Bill; and now for the first time they were told that they ought also to have the power of framing and initiating schemes on their own account. Their Lordships would be constituting a new body over whom as a Parliament they would have practically no control whatever, except some <i>ex post facto</i> discussions of their proceedings.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00871"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has moved to leave out subsection (4), which gives the Commissioners power to frame schemes. I do not possess the apprehensions that the noble Lord appears to have, and this really seems to me to be a very useful provision. The noble Lord said that the Commissioners were a judicial body. That is true in the ordinary sense of the word, but they ought to be given power, as they are in the Bill, to frame schemes as well. I may say that this proposal was very carefully gone into in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0122"/>
<col>231</col>
Grand Committee in another place. There was a long debate about it, and it was very carefully thrashed out and eventually carried by a large majority. The Commissioners have a right, as we all know, of modifying a scheme; but supposing that the body bringing forward the scheme would not accept the modification, and it was a good scheme in many ways; surely it ought not to be made impossible for the Commissioners to take up such a scheme and put it forward with the modifications and safeguards suggested by them. The Commissioners naturally would have to obtain Treasury sanction. I need not point out that the advance would not be made to the Commissioners <i>qua</i> Commissioners. The advance, of course, would be made to the Government Department concerned. I really do not think that there are the dangers in the clause that the noble Lord seems to think, and I hope he will not press his Amendment, as I am afraid I am unable to accept it as it stands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00872"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> agreed with the noble Earl that if the Development Commissioners were to be amalgamated, as the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, proposed, they must have power of initiation as well as power of administration. He was inclined to leave the subsection in.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00873"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> pointed out that it was quite possible, when the Commissioners got together, that they might very much prefer to initiate their own schemes than to adopt those put forward by the various bodies cited in the first clause and for whom the Bill was devised. Personally he would prefer to see the subsection cut out, so that the Commissioners might remain a reference body and not an initiating one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00874"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will, of course, deal with the subsection on its merits, but if we were to inquire into its history I do not think the result of our inquiries would be quite so reassuring as the noble Earl in charge of the Bill would have us believe. I am advised that this subsection formed no part of the original scheme of His Majesty's Government, but that it was introduced at a thinly-attended meeting of the Grand Committee and was accepted on that occasion by His Majesty's Government. It seems to me to be a very dangerous excrescence on the scheme of the Bill.
<col>232</col>
The Commissioners, as we understand, are to be, primarily at any rate, an advisory body, but this subsection as I read it confers upon them powers of initiation entirely distinct from the advisory functions which are naturally attributed to them. What would be the effect of the subsection? I think something of this kind, that the Commissioners under the subsection would be in the position of having their own scheme referred to themselves; they would initiate a scheme, that scheme would be referred to themselves for approval, and then recommended by themselves. That seems to me to be a very illogical and irregular arrangement and foreign to the principle of the Bill. I therefore will very gladly support my noble friend in deleting the subsection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00875"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: This matter is not quite so important a one as some noble Lords opposite seem to think, and in my opinion the somewhat gloomy apprehensions of my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale will not be realised. I do not think the matter is one of the first importance. I think the subsection would be useful in this way, that after a certain number of years have passed and the Commissioners have examined a vast number of schemes of different kinds coming from different Departments and acquired a mass of knowledge which no individual Department possesses, they might be, and I think ought to be, in a position to formulate certain schemes, and particularly schemes which might overlap the work of several different Departments. I quite follow the objection which the noble Marquess who has just sat down has taken, that it does seem somewhat anomalous that the same body should at the same time be reviewing schemes and conceivably making schemes of their own. On the other hand, considering what the standard of the body will be, and bearing in mind, as I have said, that these gentlemen will be in the possession of an amount of knowledge which nobody else in the whole country will possess, I think the power would be a useful one and I should not myself dread its being abused.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00876"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said the power proposed to be given to the Commissioners was quite foreign to the purpose for which they were to be created, which was that of an advisory body. To take the very first
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0123"/>
<col>233</col>
purpose of the Bill for which money might be advanced by the Development Commissioners to a Government Department&#x2014;agricultural education; it was quite clear that the scope of the Bill only put the Commissioners in the position of a go-between between the money they had and the Agricultural Department. The Agricultural Department had full knowledge of all the circumstances; they knew what money was required for the purposes of agricultural education and would draw up a scheme accordingly. If the Commissioners were not satisfied with that scheme, they might themselves draw up a scheme totally at variance with the one recommended by the Board of Agriculture. That was quite outside the duties for which the Development Commissioners were appointed, and he could not understand&#x2014;although, of course, being a very responsible and clever body they might be able to make a good scheme&#x2014;why such a power should be given to them when they were really an advisory committee and nothing else.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00877"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> quite recognised that their Lordships looked with a great deal of suspicion on the Bill and the quarter from which it came, but he did venture to suggest that they had allowed their apprehensions to get the better of their business considerations. Even if the subsection were omitted, the Commissioners would not be prevented from giving the tip to a Government Department that, from the knowledge they had gained, a certain scheme was desirable. Under the subsection as amended the Commissioners would frame schemes and merely recommend their adoption by a Government Department. From an ordinary business point of view was it wise that people who had special experience should sit idle without power to turn their special knowledge to account? Whether the subsection were left in the Bill or struck out would make only a technical difference.</p>

He said that much additional expenditure had been thrown on various counties as a result of the motor traffic over their highways, and before aiding the construction of new roads the State ought, from the money obtained by taxes on motor vehicles and petrol, to make grants to local authorities to assist them in repairing the destruction which had taken place in their roads through motor traffic.

<image src="S5LV0004P0I0126"/>
<col>239</col>
to an Amendment standing in his name on the same subject, in which he proposed to use the words, "and an advance made to a highway authority for the purpose of such maintenance shall be based upon any additional rate per pound rendered necessary by reason of motor traffic." He fully agreed with all that the Earl of Derby had just said, and would not press his Amendment if it met with no support from the Committee. But he would point out to their Lordships that although the abnormal expenditure caused by motor traffic on the roads might be equal in two districts, the amount which had to be raised per pound in rating to meet that expenditure might vary in the two districts very considerably. He bad in mind some of the impoverished districts in the Highlands. Tourists who paid nothing towards the rates and who had no connection with those districts did considerable damage to the roads, and it required very little damage to the roads in some districts to make the rate per pound go up by shillings; whereas in another district the same number of pence per pound might cover the same damage. He thought that in allocating any money or advance on the principle that the noble Earl had just suggested regard should be had, not only to the expenditure of the district, but also to the capacity of the ratepayers of that district to bear the burden. He had, therefore, suggested in his Amendment that an advance made to a highway authority should be based upon the additional rate per pound rendered necessary by reason of motor traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00918"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> said they had had an undertaking from the Government in the House of Commons precisely to the opposite effect of this Amendment. The Chancellor of the Exchequer when he was speaking about this scheme particularly stated&#x2014;and he had his words spoken on the 16th of June&#x2014;that he did not propose that any money should be spent on ordinary road maintenance. To take money from a special class and spend it on a road used by all classes of vehicles would be a manifest injustice. Reference had been made to Highland roads, many of which had fallen into disuse, but it would be in the competence of the Road Board to make special grants to get better material or to add to the width of the roads, and in that case it would be an advantage; but to insert
<col>240</col>
a clause, as the noble Earl wished to do, to make maintenance a charge on the funds of the Road Board would be, he thought, a great mistake. The roads had been brought up already to a very much better state, and not only motor traffic but many other kinds of traffic had increased. If they put in the word maintenance, the money for maintenance would only come from the light motors, and not from the heavy motors, which they all agreed did more damage than any other form of motor traffic. For instance, they might have a road entirely ruined by traction engine traffic, or by the running of motor omnibuses. Neither of those classes of vehicle, according to the decision in another place, would pay towards the funds of the Road Board. The inclusion of maintenance would be a breach of the agreement that the Government had entered into, which was that the Road Board should keep in view the fact that all this money came out of one special class of vehicles and should be used for the widening of roads, the diminution of dust, and the other objects set forth in the Bill. On these grounds he was sorry that he could not agree with his noble friends on the Front Bench.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00919"><member>LORD LOVAT</member> said there seemed to be an understanding, judging from the noble Lord's speech, between those who wished for rapid running on the roads and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which indicated the existence of a sort of alliance between road-hogs and a predatory Chancellor. He failed to see why their Lordships should make themselves in any way a party to that agreement. He desired to put the point of view of the two parties who were mostly concerned in the road&#x2014;firstly, the ratepayer; and, secondly, the non-road-hog motorists who used the local roads. With regard to the ratepayer, he would divide the districts into two. First, those which had big trunk roads through them; and, secondly, such districts as those which the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, had quoted in the Highlands, the roads of which a large number of motor tourists used for a short period of the year. Over the trunk roads there was undoubtedly a very large number of cars running, not on six days of the week only, as was the case with ordinary traffic, but on the seven days of the week. It was a traffic which contributed nothing to the public purse or to the local authority.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0127"/>
<col>241</col>
Then they had in far-away parts motors which used the roads for two or three months, as in the case of the Highlands, and used many roads which were otherwise never used at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00920">He would give them a concrete case&#x2014;that of a road leading from Inverness to Perth, a road which ten years ago for a distance of about twenty miles had absolutely no traffic at all. Bridges were broken down and grass was allowed to grow in the road, because no one travelled over it. That particular road now had to have a very large sum expended upon it, because in one month there was an average of seventy-nine motor cars passing on that road in a day. That had, of course, added enormously to the local rates of Inverness and of Perth. There was a petition, he believed, handed the other day to the Chancellor of the Exchequer which showed that the cost of the roads of Perthshire had gone up by nearly thirty per cent., and the whole of that was ascribed to increased motor traffic. In the same way in Inverness-shire there were three or four roads upon which hitherto there had been practically no traffic, but now they had to be kept up entirely for motorists. Surely they had a right to expect, before any grants were given for the making of roads or the rounding off of corners, that they would get a grant to pay the local authorities for the damage actually done to the roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00921">The rounding off of corners was really to suit the individual motorist, who wished to swish round the corner at top speed. The local man would have to pay more for the road, because all the motorists would then be running at a very much higher rate of speed, and would therefore do more damage to the surface of the road. Then the question would be raised as to how this damage was to be assessed. It was a point which was very often raised on this particular question as to how they were going to assess the damage done by motor cars. It was perfectly simple. The damage could be assessed on the principle of what was known as extra ordinary traffic. Many noble Lords had no doubt paid in this way in the case of cutting down woods or in connection with collieries. There was excessive traffic over a certain portion of a road and it was assessed, and the individual who caused the excessive traffic had to pay the difference. He had known cases
<col>242</col>
where the cost of roads had caused the rates to leap up twenty-five and thirty per cent., and he thought that the motorists ought to pay out of this grant those differences. He supported the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00922"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> referred to the statement of the noble Lord who had just spoken that in the Highlands there was a very large traffic that did not pay anything at all to the roads, and said he lived in a district of South Wales where they had to a less extent the same thing. But they had to remember this, that though those tourists did not pay anything directly to the rates, undoubtedly they brought an immense amount of money into the district. It was certainly true, in the county in which he lived, that little places by the seaside that practically never saw a tourist before, now did see tourists who came in their motor cars, and though the roads suffered to a small extent, there was a great deal of money brought into the districts, and in those places this traffic was not regarded unfavourably. At the same time, he would like to see the motor fund large enough to give grants where the local authorities suffered from the wear and tear of motors, but at present the fund was a small one and nine out of ten people would say that the first consideration was to deal with the dust nuisance. Tar ought to be laid down in every town and village, and for two miles outside the towns and one mile outside the villages. It had been calculated that &#x00A3;400,000 would be required for this purpose throughout the county and the Road Board might contribute &#x00A3;200,000 towards that amount. It was admitted that where tar was laid down the roads undoubtedly lasted much longer, and it was not only a benefit to the public in the summer but an actual economy in the winter. If the Road Board had power, as it would have undoubtedly under this Bill, to contribute largely to reduce the dust nuisance, he thought that the Road Board, and the motorists through the Board, would contribute largely to remedy one of the greatest grievances against motorists. The second object for using this money was the question of corners. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Lovat, spoke as if the rounding of corners was going to increase the speed of motorists enormously. In some cases that might be true; but, after all, the motorist did
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0128"/>
<col>243</col>
not want corners rounded off so that he could go more quickly round them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00923"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, he does.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00924"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> said he was afraid the noble Lord suspected motorists wherever he saw them. He had not the privilege of being in the House last week when the noble Lord spoke on this subject but he read his speech with great interest. It seemed to him (Lord St. David's) that if they put this question not only to motorists but to everybody who drove a vehicle on country roads, they would want corners not rounded off, but cut down. A motorist liked to know whether there was a cart coming round the corner, but the carter was much more anxious to know whether a motor car was coming round the corner. He thought that some noble Lords misapprehended the wishes of motorists in this matter. What they desired was not to be able to go quicker round corners, but that the corners should be cut down so that they should not be endangering their own lives, and still more, the lives of anybody else. If some of the worst corners in the country were cut down there would be in a very few years, and possibly months, a very marked diminution in the number of accidents. Subject to what he had said, he agreed with the noble Lord opposite that it would be only fair that grants should be made for the maintenance of roads. Lord Montagu had said that there would be cases where the owners of light motors, who at present were the only people taxed, would be called upon under this Amendment to provide for damage done by an entirely different vehicle. He had a case in mind on the road to Fishguard. On that road they had a very large number of motor cars. They had Irish and American motor cars and other tourists' motor cars going through the country, and they all ran on the same road and did a certain amount of damage. But on that road as a whole there was nothing like what was known as a motor track&#x2014;they all knew what a motor track was&#x2014;except in one particular place. There was a little bit of the road in Breconshire along which a motor omnibus ran all the year round. It was owned by the railway company and was run in the public interest between two points not well served by the railway, and where that motor omnibus ran there was a well-defined track all along the road. Under the Amendment
<col>244</col>
it would be rather unfair that a fund contributed to in the main by the owners of light motors should have to pay for damage obviously done in a particular place by one heavy vehicle. Any one who motored along the road to Fishguard could see that spot for himself. Subject to that he agreed with the noble Lord opposite that it was unfair that the owners of motors who lived in a town should run over the roads of the county and contribute nothing whatever towards them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00925"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he was not quite sure what the conclusion of the noble Lord's speech was, and whether he was going to vote for or against the Amendment. He agreed with most of what the noble Lord had said, but the conclusion brought to his mind was that they ought to support the Amendment and not oppose it, Lord St. David's had said with truth that the most important thing to do with the roads was to cover them with a treatment of tar, and the noble Lord thought that was secured by the Bill without the Amendment. He (Lord Salisbury) did not think it was. It was quite true that to cover the road with tar in the first place was included in the words of the Bill as it stood, but once the tar had been laid on the road, the maintaining of that tar application could not be paid out of the money of the Road Board. That would be ordinary repair, and the cost would have to be found by the ratepayers, He lived in a county where they suffered acutely through the wear and tear of the roads by motor cars. When motorists got to Wales or Scotland they could not get any further, and therefore there might be something in the noble Lord's plea that a great deal of money was brought by motor cars into the country. But, unfortunately, motorists rushed through Hertfordshire in large numbers, not, as Lord Lovat very rightly said, on six days of the week but on seven days, and the cost of their roads had gone up enormously entirely owing to the motor cars. They did not want what Lord Montagu seemed to suggest, payment for increasing their road accommodation, at least, not in the first place. What they wanted to-day was to be repaid the loss which they now sustained and which they ought not to have sustained by motor traffic. That was obviously an equitable proposition. They desired to maintain their roads in the highest condition of efficiency. Most of their Lordships who ran motors in the neighbourhood of London would agree
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0129"/>
<col>245</col>
that the local authorities had succeeded in maintaining their roads in as efficient a condition as possible, but it had cost them an enormous sum of money, and they did think they were entitled to receive part of the money drawn from the motor cars. If he might give a word of advice to his noble friend who represented in their Lordships' House what he believed was called the "motor interest," he thought they would be wise not to resist this just demand and thereby endeavour to conciliate public opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00926"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> said that although motorists were desirous of conciliating public opinion in every possible way, yet he had never discovered how a motorist could do it, and he had never seen public opinion conciliated. They had had from the noble Lord below the Gangway opposite what he took it would be called by the anti-motorist Press a reasonable and temperate statement of the case for the public. The noble Lord began by saying that the roads he was speaking of in the Highlands were traversed by cars from a distance which contributed nothing to the rates. The noble Lord undoubtedly meant contributed nothing to the local rates. He did not suppose that the, noble Lord suggested that owners of motor cars did not contribute both to Imperial and local taxation, just as other people. He lived in London and contributed to the maintenance of the streets, and did not complain of it. Shoals of travellers in cabs, principally from the North, passed his door, and why should the noble Lord, because he lived in Perthshire, complain of him when he visited Perthshire? Surely it was an advantage that roads should be made, and he should have thought it was also an advantage that roads should be used, but one would not have gathered that from the speech of the noble Lord. One thing the noble Lord said was that before this shocking advent of motor cars, which caused such terror to the local inhabitants, these roads had not been used at all. What were roads made for? Were they made in order to be looked at or shown upon a map? What object was there in making a road except that it should be used by road traffic in going from one place to another? The noble Lord had said that these roads were so bad that they had fallen into disuse, and that the bridges had been broken down and the grass allowed to grow on the roads. He thought he understood Lord Lovat also to say that there was now a constant stream
<col>246</col>
of motor cars passing along the same road. Surely the question came naturally to one's mind, Why had that road been repaired and why had those bridges been put right for traffic? The local authority were free to leave the road in a state that it was not fit for traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00927"><member>SEVERAL NOBLE LORDS</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00928"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> said that noble Lords said "No," but he heard no suggestion that the local authority had neglected their duty; but if they had neglected their duty all these years, all that the motor traffic had done had been to bring them to a sense of their duty. If the local authority were liable to be indicted for having neglected their duty, the noble Lord could not blame motorists for bringing them to a sense of that duty. Then it was said that these roads were kept up entirely for motorists. Why? Was it not the case that the population desired to have these visitors upon their roads? Motorists brought a good deal of money into these districts. Did the noble Lord think if he polled the people of Perthshire as to whether they would have motors there or not, they would vote anything but in the affirmative? If the noble Lord thought that, why did the local authorities keep up those attractive roads which brought large numbers of motorists into the country? It might just as well be argued that because somebody did not reside and pay rates in a seaside resort he should not be entitled to use the esplanade or promenade. Arguments of that kind suggested a policy of a community making a road only for the inhabitants. That was not the system on which we worked in this country. Local authorities fully recognised that it was their duty to provide and maintain roads not only for ratepayers but for visitors. There was a case in the Potteries where two large towns fairly close to each other were connected by a road maintainable by the county council. The traffic there was entirely the traffic of the towns, but the road had to be paid for by the county. He had always admitted that a county which had to incur a large expenditure for a road of that sort might naturally feel it had some grievance; but the remedy for that sort of thing was to place the main roads under the control of a larger body or to make them national roads. If they were to make the individual motor car pay, why not make the other
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0130"/>
<col>247</col>
individual traffic pay? Large traction engines, which were not to be taxed one iota, did more damage to the roads than all the light cars had ever done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00929">The Amendment was that these taxes were to be used for the maintenance of the roads. He suggested that that in itself was not a reasonable proposition; but there was a stronger reason against considering any Amendment of this sort at this stage. The noble Lord poured scorn upon what he described as an alliance between road-hogs and a predatory Chancellor. But the road-hogs, as far as he knew, were distinguished members of the Automobile Club who had not previously been so named, and the bargain amounted in effect to the Chancellor of the Exchequer saying that he was going to take a certain specific tax from a specific class of the community for a specific purpose. The Amendment suggested, as the proper development of that, that the taxation should be taken from the specific class, but that it should be allocated to quite a different purpose. That would be contrary to the whole spirit of the arrangement, and he hoped the noble Lord would not insist upon his Amendment</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00930"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> denied that any body of motorists had any right to make a bargain with Parliament. That their Lordships were to be influenced in their decision on the assumption that a voluntary body, which chose to take up an expensive amusement, extremely obnoxious to their fellow-countrymen, had entered into a bargain with the Government was the most extraordinary argument he ever heard. They were sometimes told that their Lordships' House was out of sympathy with the people, that they I did not know what the people said or what the people thought that they did not know the people's grievances or what they wanted. He had always repudiated that accusation, but he must say that when he heard debates such as they had had that night he did not wonder that people outside held that opinion. And the most extraordinary part of it was that the speeches to which he referred came from the opposite side of the House, which usually arrogated to itself a knowledge of the wants of and sympathy with the people. Lord St. David's had told them what he regarded as the great grievance of the motor traffic&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<col>248</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00931"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member><membercontribution>: The public grievance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00932"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> agreed; the grievance of the public in consequence of the motor traffic. According to the noble Lord, the main grievances were dust and comers. Dust was a horrible nuisance, and a great pecuniary loss to those who lived by the sides of the roads. As to corners, he was rather sceptical. He did not think that the carter whom the noble Lord spoke of as going round a corner in great terror would be in that terror if motor cars always went, as they should, at a proper pace round corners. Then as to the great benefit derived from tourists, he thought that was entirely a matter of chance. No doubt in some parts they did good, but in other parts that was not the case. He entirely corroborated what fell from Lord Lovat. He lived in the North of England in a very thinly-populated county. He granted that some of the inns on the high roads benefited by motor traffic, but what happened to the whole of the rest of the thinly-populated district? The real grievance of the present condition of affairs was the rising rates throughout the country. Farmers who were miles away from the road had to pay rates increased by a traffic from which they derived no advantage and never would. That was the universal cry. It had been suggested by Earl Russell that the cars or their owners contributed to the rates just as other people. Yes, but they did about three times the damage others did. The truth of the matter was that there was here a new development of a new form of locomotion, which had imposed not only dangers and inconveniences but a considerable annual loss upon the people of the country. It seemed to him but justice that those who had been responsible for producing that state of things should contribute to the relief of the excessive burden which their pursuit had imposed upon the country. He must say that it was a great pity that in that House motorists should show such little sympathy and such little understanding of where the shoe pinched their fellow-countrymen, though in their individual capacities he was sure they were as unselfish as any of the community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00933"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> said that at the risk of adding to what the noble Duke had described as the mischievous character
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0131"/>
<col>249</col>
of this debate, he desired to say a few words. Like his noble friend he, too, lived in the North of England. He lived in a county which was supposed to have many amenities as regarded its scenery and peculiar unkindness as regarded its climate, but still a great many people came there in motor cars. He could not say he agreed with the noble Duke. He liked motor cars, and he believed other people liked them. They brought a certain current of life to lonely districts, and there was a willingness to share the money which the motorist was supposed to lavish in his progress through the various counties of England. But it was felt at the same time that those who ran their motors over the roads added a deal to the expenses of the locality, and he had considerable sympathy with Lord Derby's Amendment, though from its wording he thought it went rather further than he could wish. From the way the Amendment was worded, it seemed almost a direct instruction that the maintenance of the roads should be found out of moneys specifically granted for other purposes. He did not now whether the point could be made clear in any other way. He would like it more clearly expressed that the advances would be only "towards" the maintenance of these roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00934"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> said that if the noble Lord's Amendment was adopted he thought it was only just to the case as it stood to-day that they should insert the words "light motor car traffic," because at the present time it was not proposed to tax any commercial vehicles or traction engines, and these did an enormous amount of damage. He was sure the noble Earl did not wish to ask light motor car traffic to pay for the damage done by heavy motor car traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00935"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: I put "motor traffic" in and I hope it will stand, and that it will result in the taxation of these heavy motors of which such complaint has been made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00938"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that was practically Lord Lovat's Amendment, if their Lordships would look at the words on the Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00939"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member> said his Amendment had this object in view, that the Road Board, in addition to making advances for new roads and for improving existing roads, should also have the power of making advances to those districts where on account of abnormal motor traffic abnormal damage was done to the roads. The Amendment did not compel them to give such advances, but if they thought that in a particular district this money could be justly applied towards meeting the additional expenditure involved by motor traffic, then he proposed that they should have the power to give such money. He did not see that the noble Lord's suggestion would really alter the sense of his Amendment. His Amendment did not provide that the Road Board should pay the whole of the increased cost, but that they should be able to make a grant towards it. It, however, the noble Lord opposite would like him to put in the word "towards," he did not see that it made any difference, and he would gladly accept it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00941"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> asked the noble Earl who moved the Amendment whether he would accept the suggestion about the light motor car traffic? He thought the noble Earl rather liked the idea that the heavy motor car traffic should pay, but as their Lordships' House had no power to make it pay, and the light motor car traffic was finding the money, it was only reasonable that it should be protected in this manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00942"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> confessed that the Amendment as it stood on the Paper did go rather beyond what he desired, because it would give the road authority power to make a grant for the maintenance of roads in ordinary circumstances. No doubt there was a proviso that the Road Board were to have regard to the additional expenditure incurred, but he did not think that his noble friend or their Lordships desired that in a case where there was no extra
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0132"/>

ordinary expenditure a grant should be made for maintenance. He again suggested that these words would meet the position, "or towards meeting the extraordinary expenditure incurred by the highway authorities on the maintenance of roads in consequence of motor traffic."</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00944"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member> said the noble Viscount's suggestion entirely carried out his wish, and he would be glad to substitute it for his Amendment. He therefore withdrew his Amendment, and moved it in a new form, which would make the subsection read as follows: "The Road Board shall have power, with the approval of the Treasury, to make advances to county councils and other highway authorities in respect of the construction of new roads or the improvement of existing roads or towards meeting the extraordinary expenditure incurred by the highway authority in the maintenance of roads in consequence of motor traffic."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00945"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: We have had a very interesting discussion on this clause, and I think the first thing I ought to say is that His Majesty's Government do sincerely recognise the very liberal way in which they have been met by the motorists of the United Kingdom. The motorists have come forward in a very generous way. They have cheerfully accepted a very heavy taxation for public purposes, and I think not only the Government but the country generally ought to recognise the way in which motorists have so generously faced the position. I need hardly say that any alliance between His Majesty's Government and motorists would be as much repudiated by motorists as by the Government. We all agree, of course, as to the hardships which have been so eloquently put forward by Lord Lovat and others; but, as Lord Ribblesdale said, the question really is that the noble Earl, Lord Derby, wishes advances to be made from the Road Fund for the maintenance of roads in consequence of motor traffic. That is what we have got to decide, and if I may respectfully say so all the other points raised are more or less side issues. What this Amendment really means, if it means anything at all, is a grant to the rates. That is the sole and only object of the Amendment. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has on several occasions pointed out that this is not a measure for the relief of rates. It is no more a measure for
<col>252</col>
the relief of rates than it is a Right to Work Bill. I made that as plain as I possibly could in my speech on the Second Reading, and I hope your Lordships will not lose sight of that. It is not a measure for the relief of rates, and it is not a measure to provide work in bad times. The road problem is an absolutely different problem altogether, and ought to be treated in a different way; and if I may venture to say so, this proposal is not the right way of facing it. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in Committee in another place, if this money is used for this purpose it will be thrown away. But still under the Bill the ratepayers will to a certain extent benefit, because it allows money to be spent towards the improvement of existing roads. The Board will be able to assist, as has been said, by making grunts for cutting off corners and making gradients easier, and so forth. There was one question asked that I think I ought to answer. It was whether tar sprinkling, which is of such enormous importance to the unfortunate dwellers on the roadside, would come under the category of the improvement of roads. I think there is no doubt about that, because in Clause 8, subclause (3), you will find these words&#x2014;
<quote>"For the purposes of this Part of this Act the expression 'improvement of roads' includes the widening of any road, the cutting off the corners of any road where land is required to be purchased for that purpose, the levelling of roads, the treatment of a road for mitigating the nuisance of dust," etc.</quote></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00947"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Quite so; but as I read it road sprinkling can be safely done under Clause 8, subclause (3). In these circumstances and as the Amendment is simply and solely a grant to the rates, it would be impossible for His Majesty's Government to accept this provision.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00950">Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00951">[<i>The sitting was suspended at a quarter to eight o'clock and resumed at a quarter past nine.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00952"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> moved to leave out the words which gave the Road Board power "themselves to construct and maintain any new roads." He wished to make it quite clear that he did not at all desire to do what Lord Montagu of Beaulieu objected to&#x2014;namely, deprive the Road Board of initiative in this matter. He spoke of the Road Board as it now stood in the Bill, but he referred to any authority who might be entrusted with this part of the Bill. As the Bill originally stood, the Road Board was entrusted with very great powers with reference to the making of new roads. The idea then was that the Road Board should, as it were,
<col>254</col>
map out the country and propose some great new roads such as from London to York, or from London to Exeter, and that these roads, when made, should not be general highways, but solely main ways for motor traffic. Motors were to be allowed to go at any speed they liked over those roads. It was a conception of an entirely different kind, he was glad to say, from anything that now existed in the Bill. That proposal was rejected in spite of Party ties, by the commonsense of members in another place, and they had now a very truncated form of the power originally proposed to be conferred on the Road Board. This power was solely for the construction and maintenance of new roads, which were to be ordinary highways, used like other highways for ordinary traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00953">He did not think it was advisable or
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0134"/>
<col>255</col>
necessary to confer such powers on the Road Board. In the first place, he doubted whether they had, or would have, means at all sufficient for this purpose. They were already bound by the clause as it stood, and by the Amendment to which their Lordships had just agreed. In the first place, before they constructed or maintained any new roads, they had to make advances to county councils and other highway authorities in respect of the improvement of existing roads and towards the extraordinary cost of maintenance in consequence of motor traffic. Therefore, out of their &#x00A3;600,000 a year, there would necessarily be but a small amount that could be devoted to this purpose, and that amount was carefully confined under subsection (2) of this clause, to one-third of the estimated receipts of the Road Board for any year. It could not, therefore, in any way exceed &#x00A3;200,000, a year. Some persons, as he had observed in the Press that morning, had a very extended idea as to the possibilities of the construction of new roads by the Road Board. They had suggested, for example, a new road round Brentford, new roads to connect London with the North and West or South of England, and other proposals of that kind, which could not be carried out except by expenditure far in excess of anything that could possibly be available to the Road Board under this Bill. Practically confined as the Road Board were to a maximum of &#x00A3;200,000 a year, all that they could do under this Bill in the construction of new roads would be to construct a few new roads in country districts where land might be reasonably cheap, and where such new roads would certainly be less wanted than in more populous areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00954">Now, was this the best way of improving the roads in England? He did not believe it was. If the Road Board took upon themselves to plan out a new road through the district of local authorities who did not approve of that road they would be from the beginning in practical antagonism to those local authorities, who would say "If you make this road you will make a road we do not require; you will impose on us (under the Bill as it stood) the liability for the future maintenance of the road; you will increase our rates to that extent, and you will do it against our will." He did not believe in the efficiency of that
<col>256</col>
kind of compulsion. What he did believe in was the power of the purse, which was really provided by subsection (1) of this clause. If the Road Board desired a new road to be made through the district of any local authority all they would have to do if, as he proposed, paragraph (<i>b</i>) were left out, would be to communicate in the first place with the local authorities concerned, and suggest to them that a road should be constructed between such and such places. If the local authorities were willing to undertake the work, the Road Board could under the Bill give them a grant towards the cost. The county council, necessarily and rightly fortified as it would be under the Bill with the power of compulsory purchase of land, would be able, aided by this grant, to construct the new road infinitely more to the satisfaction of the people concerned and infinitely more efficiently and cheaply than the Road Board could construct it. Every road authority had at its command a surveyor and a staff experienced in the construction and maintenance of roads, who would be able in such circumstances to give their services for this work; but the Road Board or the Commissioners, whoever their Lordships might decide upon as the authority under this part of the Bill, would have to form a staff of the kind for themselves at great expense, and, as he said, at an absolutely unnecessary expense as compared with the procedure he had just indicated. Surely before they gave a central board of this kind authority to construct roads against the wishes of the local authorities, they ought to try to see whether they could not persuade the local authorities to do the work themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00955">If anybody looked back at the history of the roads of England for the last twenty years and compared the state of those roads at present with the state in which they were before county councils were instituted, he would realise the extraordinary improvement that had taken place. He ventured to say that in no country in the world had the state of the main roads progressed more than in this country in the last twenty years. Could they say, then, that these county authorities which had already done so much were not likely to rise to what was necessary in the future, and, aided as they might be by the central authority under this Bill with grants from
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0135"/>
<col>257</col>
the Imperial Exchequer, do all that was necessary for the improvement of the roads? All he contended was that they ought to try thorn first. If, having tried them, they found that the work could not be done, then Parliament might interfere and place greater powers, as some persons now desired, in the hands of a central road board; but, considering what had been done and the willingness of the county authorities to aid in this work of improvement, surely they ought to pause before placing in the hands of a central authority of this kind powers which were already so well exercised by the local authorities. The noble Earl the Lord Steward knew a new-road in the county in which he (Viscount St. Aldwyn) lived, Gloucestershire, towards which a very large grant had been made by the county council. There was no hesitation in granting what funds were necessary for the construction of that new road. He believed the same was the case all over England. Let them give the county councils what they would have under this Bill, compulsory powers for the purchase of laud at a reasonable rate, and they would make as many new roads, with the aid of a giant from the national Exchequer, as could possibly be desired.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00956">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 6, line 27, to leave out the words '(<i>b</i>) themselves to construct and maintain any new roads.'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount St. Aldwyn.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00957"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount proposes an Amendment the effect of which would be to deprive the Road Board of the power of constructing new roads. In the powerful speech he made he said that you ought to try the local authorities first. But we must remember that in old days all the main trunk roads of the kingdom were made by turnpike trusts under Act of Parliament, and, in view of the national importance of these roads, I think the noble Viscount would be the first to agree that it would be impossible to allow one single authority to upset a scheme, though, of course, as I said before, the Road Board would go in the first place to the local authority and see what could be done to obtain the sanction of that authority. London is, of course, different from the country districts, but all those who have been on the London County Council know what terrible difficulty there was with the tramways owing to the borough authorities
<col>258</col>
refusing to allow the tramways to go through the areas of their different jurisdictions, and even when permission was given, conditions were exacted which enormously increased the cost of the undertaking. If that was done in London, although I agree that the conditions are dissimilar, I really do not see why it should not be done in the country; and therefore if we are ever to have these big roads in any particular district where they are wanted, would it not be much better to have some central authority to make them? I repeat that it is not in any way intended under the Bill to make it the first duty of the Road Board to construct great trunk roads, and to rush wildly into any great expense. The noble Viscount also pointed out the difficulty that might arise on account of the small amount of money there was to spend. One-third of the &#x00A3;600,000 is the limit under Clause 8, subsection (2), and therefore. I think that would be a guarantee that no immense expenditure would be run into. Though, of course, the money is a small amount, at any rate a beginning might be made towards carrying out a very big scheme which might be of great national importance. Then, of course, there are the safeguards which I have already pointed out, that before approving the construction of a new road the Treasury have to consult the Local Government Board, and objections raised by any highway authorities will be considered. I think under these conditions the objections of the noble Viscount are not perhaps as serious as he makes out. As this Amendment strikes really at the root of the whole Bill, it would be impossible for His Majesty's Government to accept it, and I must, therefore, ask your Lordships to adhere to the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00958"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> said he had listened with the greatest interest to the noble Viscount, and he was glad to hear him say that he would not object to the Development Commission or the Road Board, or whatever authority was appointed, having the power of initiative. That, to him, was a most welcome admission; but in moving this particular Amendment, the noble Viscount was, as the noble Earl opposite had said, striking at the very essence of the Bill. Perhaps it was not generally recognised that in this country there had been no main road construction since 1837. While Governments of every country in Europe had encouraged
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0136"/>
<col>259</col>
the making of new roads, this country, with its enormously increasing traffic, and a traffic which had become much more rapid in character, had stood still. Not a single mile of main road had been made for something like eighty years. He would take the concrete case which the noble Viscount mentioned&#x2014;that of Brentford. He would assume for the sake of argument that some day this Road Board had the desire to make a road from the corner of Goldhawk road to Hounslow, where it joined the Southampton, Exeter, and Bath roads. If the Road Board, after consultation with the Local Government Board and having exhausted all the means of persuasion and pecuniary inducements failed to induce the local authority to make the road, the Road Board ought as a last resource to make the road itself. If the noble Viscount's Amendment were passed it would be entirely at the mercy of some small district council between these two points&#x2014;a matter of some six miles apart&#x2014;to block the progress of that road for an indefinite time. They had had experience of that in other directions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00959">He would recall a case in the Midlands. The want of a main road between Birmingham and Wolverhampton had become very great indeed. The result had been that a circuitous route had had to be used for years, a bad road along which horse flesh had toiled uphill and down. Only recently the two great towns had agreed with the authorities in between so that they were able to construct a trunk road. That was just the sort of case in point. He was informed that it had taken fifteen years to get the agreement through. Under this Bill the Road Board, after having exhausted all other means to make a new road, could construct it themselves. He could quote a number of other instances of short cuts between main roads which were in a similar condition; but it seemed to him that if the Development Commissioners or the Road Board were really to have any effective power and to be able to resist what he would call, without offence, the blackmailing of the smaller councils, they surely ought to have the power to construct new roads without appealing to other bodies. It must be remembered also in this matter that if the Road Board constructed these roads it would be out of money provided by one special kind of traffic, and that, although only one special kind of traffic was to pay for these roads, they were to be usable by the public at large,
<col>260</col>
to be subject to the general highway law, and a speed limit was to be imposed. These roads would be made really at the expense of the motorists largely for the benefit of the public at large. Motorists would contribute, moreover, in perpetuity, out of the special taxes falling upon them, towards the upkeep of the roads when made.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00960">He could not see any great danger or anything revolutionary or Socialistic in the construction of roads at the expense of motorists for the use of the general public. To refuse roads made at the expense of one class of traffic for the benefit of all classes was to look a gift horse in the mouth. If the roads were going to be made out of the rates, the representatives of the ratepayers on the county councils would have the right to object; but under the circumstances he could see no reason for taking away from the Road Board or the Commissioners the power to make new roads. He had been recently in France studying some questions in a more or less official sense, and he could assure noble Lords that the desire of every civilised country in Europe to-day was to improve the facilities of roads. In the case of Vienna, Paris, and Berlin roads were to be constructed at the expense of the whole community; whereas the roads proposed to be made under the provisions of this Bill would be wholly constructed and largely kept up by taxes raised on one special class of traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00961"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member> said it seemed that this kind of enterprise was eventually bound to become a very serious burden on the rates. By Clause 10, subsection (2), where the highway authority to whom the advance was made was a county council the new road, when constructed, would be a main road and in any other case would be a highway repairable by the inhabitants at large. No matter from what source the money was derived in the first instance, this kind of enterprise would in the end become an additional burden upon the ratepayers. Their Lordships had no doubt listened with great interest to Earl Russell's speech, in which he pointed out that if they did not pay rates in one part of the country they did in another. That was a very old argument, and in a certain sense it was rather a plausible one; but those who used motor cars did not correspond with
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0137"/>
<col>261</col>
the ratepayers, the majority of whom did not own motor cars. It was the non-motor owning portion of the community who felt the burden of the rates much more than those who owned motor cars, and upon whom eventually the burden would fall for all these new roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00962"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> pointed out that by subsection (2) of the clause under consideration the new authority had the power to contribute towards the maintenance of the new roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00963"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member> said he did not contest that proposition for a single moment; but there was the fatal phrase in subsection (2) of Clause 10, "inhabitants at large." The noble Earl, Lord Carrington, had said that motorists had behaved extremely generously in this matter. He would not at all question their motives but he most humbly and most respectfully desired to register a protest against the argument of which they had heard so much lately, that because a particular section of the community who indulged in a particular kind of pastime contributed, whether by arrangement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer or not, some money towards the general taxation of the country, that that money should <i>ipso facto</i> be ear-marked for a particular purpose, and that they should stretch the maxim that "he who pays the piper calls the tune," and, having paid this money, should consider that they had a right to engineer and direct the public policy in matters of this kind. He could assure the noble Earl that if he would join with the rest of the community in making roads passable both for motorists and everybody else he for one would support him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00964"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he did not like to allow the debate to pass without saying a few words. The noble Viscount had undoubtedly raised a most important point by his Amendment. This was not only a question whether the Road Board should have the power of making a new road or not; if this power were taken out of the Bill the noble Viscount proposed to do away with the Road Board so far as it was to be a road authority at all, and to have no board with administrative powers as to roads. In fact, any money that the Commissioners had to dispose of would be handed over to the county councils
<col>262</col>
to spend on improvements to their own roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00965">He thought the noble Viscount had missed one point which was of some importance with regard to the future development of roads. In the last few years there had been a marked change in the traffic on the roads, and it was likely that in the next few years there would be a still greater change. Those who had studied the question were convinced that there must be some system of roads besides that now in existence&#x2014;that there must be national trunk roads not paid for out of the rates but out of State funds. He was not merely giving his own opinion or the opinion of those who acted with him on the County Councils Association. Earlier in the year there was, as many of their Lordships might be aware, a road conference attended not only by all the road authorities in the kingdom, but also by those whose business it was to keep up the roads and by representatives of all the classes of people who used the roads. It was natural in such a large body as that, sitting for two days, that there must have been a great many differences of opinion, but to his mind it was extremely satisfactory that there were certain points on which there was a general agreement. One of the first of the resolutions passed by a very large majority was that the classification of roads should be undertaken by some Government Department and that they should be classified under two heads&#x2014;primary and secondary roads; the former to be supported mainly out of a grant given by the Government. The point that ran through all the discussions which resulted in those resolutions was that there must be some system of roads beyond the system of local roads supported by local authorities. If they had an opportunity to start any system of that sort he very much doubted whether it would be wise on their part to take action which would at all events prevent it having a fair trial.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00966">He could quite admit what the noble Viscount said as to its not being likely at present that there would be any very great trunk roads constructed throughout the whole of England; but what he thought likely was that if there were a road authority, and that authority consisted of gentlemen not only of ability but also of experience and thoroughly conversant with local conditions and local government,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0138"/>
<col>263</col>
a great deal might be done in the direction of carrying out the resolutions passed at the road conference, because use might be made of existing roads to some extent by making new pieces of road from one to another. There might be opportunities to a central authority of making through roads from great centres of population, but which no local authority had any chance of carrying out. If these roads were carefully thought out and well laid down they might not only be of great advantage to through traffic, but might relieve local roads of a great part of their traffic, and by that means a saving in the rates might be effected. Was it wise to look a gift horse in the mouth if they had an offer of a sum of money paid by the central authority not only to improve existing roads&#x2014;and he understood that the sum given for that purpose would be handed over entirely to the county councils and the work would be carried out by them&#x2014;but for making new roads which might be of advantage to the general traffic of the district? He himself hesitated about taking such a responsibility as would be upon them if they refused to give a trial to such a system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00967">The noble Viscount had stated his case, as he always did, with the utmost moderation and ability; but he (Lord Belper) was bound to say that he could not go quite as far as the noble Viscount in thinking that if a grant were made by the Government to a county council for a large road in their county, they would be willing to find the rest of the money to carry it out. His own opinion, founded on his knowledge of the funds of the county councils at the present moment, was that they would not feel justified in casting a greater charge on the rates than they were absolutely obliged to do. For that reason, at all events, if an offer were made to throw the whole cost upon a central fund they ought to accept it. The noble Lord who spoke last was entirely mistaken with regard to Clause 10. If the money were contributed by the Development Commissioners to the county council for making the road it would become a main road and would be repairable at the expense of the county council; but if the Road Board themselves made a new road they would be responsible for the whole maintenance of the road.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00968"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Oh, no.</membercontribution></p>
<col>264</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00969"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he believed he was entirely right in that; indeed, they had had a deputation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer upon this very question of the maintenance of the roads. Where the new road had been made by the county council, either with a contribution or full payment from the Government, the Chancellor of the Exchequer consented to insert a clause which was now in the Bill&#x2014;namely, subsection (2) of Clause 8, to the effect that "in making advances to highway authorities in respect of the construction of new roads, the Road Board may&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00970"><member>SEVERAL NOBLE LORDS</member><membercontribution>: "May."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00971"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he was perfectly aware of the word. That was the point. He did not think it was quite reasonable to say that in all cases it should be done; but the Road Board "may, where they think it desirable, also contribute towards the cost of maintenance of such new roads." In the case of a road constructed by the Road Board, he ventured to think&#x2014;and the noble Earl opposite would make it clear if he were wrong&#x2014;that that would be a trunk road, and that the expense would be borne by the road authority themselves, because the road would go through the districts of a great many local authorities, and it would be impossible for one local authority to undertake the work. If he were right in that contention, so far from its being a disadvantage for the Road Board to make the road themselves it would be a distinct advantage; and in the opportunities he had had of discussing this Bill with gentlemen who were thoroughly conversant with the matter he was assured that there was not the slightest idea either of interfering with the county council in the management of, or the carrying out of any improvements to, their own roads; nor was there any intention of putting any cost upon the county councils unless it was in respect of the roads they made themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00972"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: It does.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00973"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said that was the contention; but he did not think it did. Under those circumstances he hesitated to support an Amendment which he was afraid would have the effect at all events of preventing this experiment from being tried upon the roads, and which experiment, if carried out with judgment, might prove of great advantage to the country.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0139"/>
<col>265</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00974"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> said he was not quite sure that he correctly understood the noble Viscount who moved the Amendment, and he would like to ask him one or two questions. If the noble Viscount got rid of the words which he proposed to omit by his Amendment, he assumed it was in the mind of the noble Viscount to get rid of Clause 7 altogether.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00975"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00976"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> said he understood that the noble Viscount's chief argument against the Road Board was that from the nature of things at present it would not be able to do very much; that it would have very little money to do all the great things expected of it, and that those things could be very much better done if the Commissioners allotted them to others such as the county councils. The question he desired to ask was whether, when he spoke of the insufficiency of the funds at the disposal of the Road Board, the noble Viscount contemplated that they would have to acquire the land on each side of the road. He quite realised that if they had to buy 220 yards on each side of the road, it was only in the outlying districts that anything could be done. Very little could be done anywhere else with the funds at the disposal of the Road Board, though he thought his noble friend below him looked at it very fairly when he said they could not do very much harm if they could not do very much good.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00977"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he should be very happy to answer the noble Lord so far as he could. Of course what he had in his mind was the Bill as it stood. He did not know whether the Government would agree to the omission of the remarkable provision which would enable 220 yards on each side of the road to be taken by the Board. He had considered the matter from the point of view of the Bill remaining as it was, and he might say, further, that he could not agree with his noble friend Lord Belper that if a road were constructed by the Road Board it would necessarily be maintained in future by the Road Board. No doubt it might be so maintained if the Road Board desired it; but in Clause 9, subsection (1), were these words "Every road constructed by the Road Board under the provisions of this Act shall be a public highway, and the enactments relating to highways and bridges shall apply to such
<col>266</col>
roads accordingly." Surely those enactments involved a liability on the rate-payers to keep the road in repair. Of course, if His Majesty's Government were to tell him that they were prepared to agree to the omission of the provision enabling the Road Board to take a width of 220 yards on each side whenever they made a new road, and were also willing to make it compulsory on the Road Hoard either to maintain the roads constructed by the Road Board or to give such grants to the county councils as would enable them to maintain those roads, he would be quite willing to reconsider his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00978"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> asked if he was to understand that the noble Viscount went so far with him as to say that if these expensive fringes were out of the Bill he would see no objection to the Road Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00979"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I should like to discuss that a little later.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00980"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> asked if the noble Viscount had directed his attention to the first part of Clause 9, which said, "For the purpose of the maintenance, repair, improvement and enlargement of or dealing with any road constructed by the Road Board, the Road Board shall have the same powers (except the power of levying a rate) and be subject to the same duties as a county council." The duties of a county council with regard to roads was to keep them in repair, and it seemed perfectly clear in Clause 9 that if a road were constructed by the Road Board that Road would have the same powers and duties as a county council, and therefore the road would be a highway repairable by the Road Board and not by the county council.</p>

But the Bill seemed to be quite clear in the opposite direction. The paragraph which their Lordships were now discussing ran, "themselves to construct and maintain any new roads." Subsection (2) read as follows: "In making advances to highway authorities in respect of the construction of new roads, the Road Board may, where they think it desirable, also contribute towards the cost of maintenance of such new roads." That was the very point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00985"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: But it is an entirely different thing. In one case the Road Board make the roads, and in the other they advance the money to the county council to make roads of their own.</membercontribution></p>

Could he take it from the noble Earl that His Majesty's Government would make it clear in the Bill that wherever the central authority made a new road they would be entirely responsible for its maintenance?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00987"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I point out to the noble Marquess where that is provided for. Clause 9 says that, "For the purpose of the maintenance, repair, improvement, and enlargement of or dealing with any road constructed by the Road Board, the Road Board shall have the same powers (except the power of levying a rate) and be subject to the same duties as a county council have and are subject to as respects main roads." That is the liability to keep in repair.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00989"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My impression was that the words were put in in order to make it clear that these roads were not to be kept for a particular class of traffic&#x2014;that they were not to be motor

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00990"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked how the noble Earl got over the argument that the enactments relating to highways made it the duty of the local authority to repair them. If every road constructed by the Road Board was to be a public highway and the enactments relating to highways were to apply to such roads, it appeared to be contradictory to the first part of the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00991">LORD said he rather agreed with Lord Belper. Clause 8 seemed to refer to roads apparently to be constructed by the county council, aided by grants from the Road Board. In that case the Road Board might subscribe something towards the maintenance of the roads. Clause 9 dealt with a different kind of road&#x2014;namely, roads constructed entirely by the Road Board; and in that case the I expense of maintenance fell entirely on the Road Board. It seemed to him that the two clauses were quite distinct.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00995"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he had placed an Amendment on the Paper in the earlier part of the Bill for the purpose of combining the Road Board with the Commissioners, but he quite admitted that in doing so he had in view the possibility that their Lordships would omit the power of the Road Board to construct and maintain any new roads. The retention of that power no doubt, had to some extent, weakened his argument for the amalgamation of the two bodies; but he would move at this point to leave out "Board" in order to insert "Commissioners," with
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0141"/>
<col>269</col>
the object of ascertaining the views of there Lordships on the subject. As he had placed the Amendment on the Paper he thought at any rate he ought to give their Lordships an opportunity of debating the point. His object was to avoid the unnecessary multiplication of authorities of this kind. This was not the only case in which there seemed to have been a desire on the part of the present Government to multiply central boards for the performance of duties which had hitherto been performed&#x2014;and he believed on the whole satisfactorily performed&#x2014;by local authorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00996">There appeared to be a sort of notion prevalent in high quarters at present that the elected local authorities were incapable of properly performing their duties, and that they must be not merely supervised but compelled to perform those duties, by pressure from some central authority. He had had experience a long time ago of Irish Government, and he thought anybody who had that experience would be aware that if there was one thing more denounced than another in connection with Irish Goverment it was the multiplication of boards in Dublin Castle. He trusted a similar process was not to be repeated in England. If a new authority was to be constituted, for the sake of economy, if economy was any object to anybody nowadays, they should endeavour to place as many duties as possible under one board. The first part of the Bill proposed the appointment of Commissioners who were to be men of high standing and very considerable ability and experience to carry out a very varied list of duties. They had to consider the necessities of agriculture and all kinds of matters connected with that great industry; they had to consider forestry and the reclamation and drainage of land, rural transport, harbours, inland navigation, and fisheries. It would not be very much to add to this wide and varied list of work which was to be considered by the Commisisoners the question of grants to local authorities for the construction of new roads, and even administrative work in what he would submit were the rare cases in which it would be necessary and possible for this body to construct new roads themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-00997">It had certainly been admitted in the course of the debate, and it must be
<col>270</col>
admitted by everybody who considered the possibilities and the amount of funds which would be at the disposal of this body, whatever it was, that the construction of new roads could be carried on by them to a very small extent, and therefore it would not be necessary for them to engage for that purpose any considerable permanent staff. He knew there had been a feeling in certain quarters associated with the motor industry that there ought to be, in the authority dealing with these matters, some special representation of the great interests in which they were concerned. He entirely agreed, but that representation could be given equally on the Commission as on the Road Board. Could it be said that men of the great ability and experience necessary for Commissioners would be incapable of all administrative work simply because under the first part of the Bill their main duties would be rather judicial than administrative? He did not believe it. He believed it would be perfectly possible for the Commissioners as constituted under the first part of the Bill, with the addition of a couple of members specially qualified by experience either in the construction or in the use of roads, to carry out the work. He would gladly see words inserted to enable the motor industry to be represented on the Commission. He believed it would be perfectly possible for such a body to perform satisfactorily all the duties which were imposed on the Road Board by the second part of the Bill. There would be also the great advantage that they would have one Department instead of two Departments. They would have one Department, perhaps, with a couple of additional members, possibly one of them paid, which would be a small matter, and they would avoid all the expense connected with the staffing and housing of two Departments. He believed one Department would be not only more economical than two, but infinitely more efficient. They were by the Bill conferring on two Boards powers with regard to rural transport, and surely nothing could be more inconvenient than to exclude from the power of the Commissioners anything connected with the construction or improvement of roads, although the Bill empowered them to deal with the making of light railways. Thanks to the great extension of motor traffic light railways were much less needed than they were twenty years ago. Practically they were conferring
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0142"/>
<col>271</col>
by this Bill on two Boards powers with regard to rural transport which ought to be exercised by one only, and in consequence of that proposal they had actually to insert clauses in the Bill to require one of the boards to consult with the other before making any recommendation for an advance for the purpose of rural transport. He really thought that that subsection was almost enough to justify his proposal without any further argument.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-00999"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> said the agricultural ratepayer for many years past had been anxious that some of the main roads of the country, at any rate, should be taken over and managed at the expense of the Government. Was there any better chance for the rural ratepayer than this? If a Road Board was once established then those who represented in this country the great industry of agriculture would be far more likely than they ever were before to get the main roads made a national and not a local charge. From the point of view of agriculture, it was very advisable that the Road Board should be started. He could not help thinking that we would have in this country before long a demand for the construction of main roads from quite a different source. He was struck by a report in that morning's newspapers of a discussion the previous night at the United Service Institution on the need for motor traction for the Army. It was now admitted by soldiers that if there ever was a raid in this country the military forces would have to be taken largely, not by rail, but by road; that was a line of argument which was going on at the present time among military reformers. Therefore they were going to have a demand that roads should be made in this country for military purposes, and if those roads were ever to be made it was necessary that there should be a Road Board. He was convinced that a body of men who were not giving their whole time to this business would never be able to do this work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01000">The matter of the roads under this Bill, if attended to carefully, was going to be a
<col>272</col>
business that must take absolutely the whole time of those who attended to it. Some of the members of the Board were to be paid and some unpaid. He thought those who would be unpaid would be very self-sacrificing gentlemen. The work of the Board would involve an immense amount of detail. It was generally agreed that a good many corners of roads ought to be cut off. Supposing the sum of &#x00A3;50,000 was to be at the disposal of the authority to be given every year to local authorities to remove corners. The estimate was that a corner would cost about &#x00A3;50 to remove. As an average sum he thought that excessive, but at &#x00A3;50 a corner the sum of &#x00A3;50,000 devoted to this purpose per annum would mean one thousand corners. That would involve a great deal of detail work for the Board who would have to dole out the money to the local authorities and see that it was not wasted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01001">The other day Lord Willoughby de Broke had called attention to the great nuisance on the roads caused by great trains of trucks drawn by traction engines. They undoubtedly were a great nuisance; but, after all, this traction was connected with business. In going about the country most of their Lordships had seen places where there were large quarries worked, and the stone was conveyed from the quarries to the railway station two or three miles distant by means of these traction engines. The business in which they were employed was advantageous to the landowner, to the labour in the district, and to the industries they supplied. All these cases had to be gone into in detail on their merits. His own view was that if this work was to be done properly it would take absolutely the whole time of the gentlemen in charge, and he did not believe, speaking as a matter of business, that there lived a body of men who could do all the things set out in the first Part of the Bill and also manage in detail improvements all over the country of the main roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01002"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> entirely agreed with the noble Lord who had just sat down. He looked upon the setting up of the Road Board as one of the most essential parts, in fact the most essential part, of the Bill. He looked forward to the Road Board becoming eventually the central highway authority of this country. He hoped to see it eventually the parent
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0143"/>
<col>273</col>
of national roads, paid for not by the local ratepayer but by the nation and the traffic using them. They were starting with an income of &#x00A3;600,000 a year, and this would probably increase to &#x00A3;1,000,000 a year. To hand that over to seven Commissioners, only two of whom would have any interests as regards roads, would be an unsound thing from a business point of view.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01003">The study of roads and traffic was a very special study. For some years past he had devoted a good deal of time to it, and felt that he had just learnt a little about it. No one who had not attended the international conferences that had taken place on this subject and who had not followed the reports of the various commissions and committees that had reported in the last ten years, could have any real idea of the national importance of this question. The railways in this country might be taken as having twelve hundred millions of capital invested in them; the roads had at least three times as much as that invested in them in solid cash. Again, not only did the whole of the traffic using the railways make use also of the roads during some part of its transit, but millions of individuals used the roads who seldom used the railway. Good roads were a great asset to a country. It was quite impossible for this Bill to do any good either from the point of view of improving the roads for traffic, abating dust, or relieving danger if they did not have a Road Board. There was not a single Departmental Committee or Royal Commission from the time of the Departmental Committee on Highways in 1903, of which he had the honour to be a member, to the Royal Commission on London Traffic which had not recommended the establishment of a central highway authority; and even in the case of London, with its comparatively small mileage of roads, a Traffic Board was recommended for the metropolis in order to secure continuous, consecutive, and competent road policy. If the noble Viscount's suggestion were adopted the Bill would be of very little use so far as the highways of this country were concerned, and would make confusion worse confounded in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01004">He urged their Lordships before giving definite support to the noble Viscount to consider how very important the Road Board was. The noble Viscount had
<col>274</col>
named various duties of the Commissioners, which he said could easily be added to by putting the work of the Road Board upon them. He thought that was an argument in precisely the other direction. As the Commissioners were to have so much put upon them already, it was very inadvisable to add a new set of duties of a highly technical nature, and which could not be properly carried out except by an authority appointed <i>ad hoc</i>. Their Lordships would make a mistake if they refused to sanction the appointment of a Road Board, and he was sure the people of this country would regret it in the long run.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01005"><member>THE EARL OF JERSEY</member> supported the view taken by the two noble Lords who had spoken last, and gave an instance in connection with the Light Railway Com-missioners. He said that in the early years of the Commissioners when there was a feeling in favour of light railways, they had from eighty to a hundred applications each year, and it was almost as much as the engineering member of the Commission could do to prepare the plans for their consideration. This Bill when it became an Act would be very popular in the sense I that there would be a great many applications under it. It would be impossible, he was certain, for those applications to be properly considered by the Commissioners under the first portion of the Bill. After ail, it must be borne in mind that the objections presented to applications would have to be considered. The Commissioners would have to go down in many cases and view the spot. He thought it would be quite impossible for sub-departments of the Commission to undertake the duty. He agreed with Lord Montagu of Beaulieu that it was essential in the interest of the public&#x2014;he was not a motorist&#x2014;that they should have a Road Department thoroughly to investigate these matters, to go all over the country, see the spots where improvements could be made, and in some cases perhaps to check the disposition of local authorities to get the money spent in their own districts. But to say all that could be done by adding two members to a Commission which had already very important duties of a different character allotted to them would not be wise on their Lordships' part. Therefore, he hoped the noble Viscount&#x2014;although he was sorry to differ from him on matters of country life&#x2014;would see his way to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0144"/>
<col>275</col>
withdraw the Amendment; and give to the country districts the only chance they had ever had to improve and widen their roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01006"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> hoped the House would support the Amendment. Nobody was more keenly alive than he was to the great necessity of keeping the roads in this country in order, because, apart from what had been already said, they would see as the roads went on more and more traffic diverted from the railways on to the roads, and therefore it behoved all authorities, whoever they might be, to keep the roads in as good condition as possible. It seemed to him that the object of this Amendment was to do what he was sure all would wish to do, and that was to avoid the misuse and the useless and unnecessary expenditure of public money. The proposal of the Government was practically to start two entirely new Government Departments with their various expenses and salaries, and he did not think it had been proved to the satisfaction of their Lordships that the work proposed to be done could not be done quite as well by the Commissioners with perhaps a slight addition to their number. It could not be denied that the country was already fully equipped with roads, and he could not help thinking that the question of new roads, although important, might be rather a small one. It might be desirable here and there, perhaps, to construct new roads, but he thought the instances would be very few and far between, and in that case he did not see why the question of new roads should not be undertaken by the same Department as the Commissioners would preside over. In any case, he thought, where there was a question possibly of making a new road in any district or of improving an existing one, it was surely a question of which local authorities could judge for themselves equally as well as the central authority in London, and without putting the country to the very serious expense of an extra Department.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01007"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I think it must have struck every one of your Lordships who listened to the carefully-reasoned speech of Lord Zouche what a mercy it is that this question, which is one of immense importance, is in no way a Party question. It is simply a matter of administration, and simply as a matter of administration
<col>276</col>
it has been very calmly reasoned on both sides. The matter in my opinion is of the greatest possible importance. It is almost impossible to exaggerate its importance. The proof of that is the great interest it has aroused, not only in Parliament, but also outside, and, though I do not want to put it too high, I think I can fairly say that public opinion is on the whole in favour of two boards and against the idea of the two boards being rolled into one. We have heard to-night a powerful speech by Lord Belper, who spoke on behalf of the Association of County Councils and is in favour of two boards, and I may claim as being on our side <i>The Times</i> newspaper, which I suppose I may say under its new management represents a very large body of public opinion. The London County Council also, I believe, is in favour of two boards. Lord St. Aldwyn laid down the maxim that one board would be more efficient and economical than two. That would be so in most cases; but there are exceptions to every rule, and I venture to think that this case is an exception, and that two bodies are needed to carry out the provisions of the Bill as they should be carried out.<lb/>
The noble Viscount asked whether it could be said that the Commissioners would be incapable of administrative work. Most certainly not; but the work which the Commissioners will have to do and the work of the Road Board are essentially different. The former will be a consultative and semi-judicial body, while the Road Board will be an executive body in part at any rate, with the power under the Bill to construct and maintain new roads. For this purpose they will have to acquire land compulsorily in some cases&#x2014;I hope not in many&#x2014;but an order will then have to be obtained from the Commissioners. The adoption of the Amendment would entirely upset that arrangement, which is a great protection to landlords. I happen to be a landlord myself, and I have a sneaking kindness for anything that is put in the Bill that may be a protection to myself and my fellow landlords. I should like to point out that the qualifications of these two bodies are very different. It is true that under the proposal of the noble Viscount two members of the Commission, which is to be increased if he has his way from five to seven, are to be road experts, and if the work is to be left to them there is no real advantage in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0145"/>
<col>277</col>
merging the bodies. It would be only two members as against five.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01008"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: The whole staff.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01009"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: That is economy. That is not my point. If the work is to be done well it would be hardly worth while skimping the expense. Many a ship has been spoilt for a ha'porth of tar, and I should recommend that if the work is to be thoroughly well done the money would not be wasted by paying well for it. If the work was left to the two expert road commissioners there would be no advantage in merging the two bodies, and if it was not they would be out-voted by people who admittedly had no special knowledge of roads or traffic. There is only one thing more I should like to say, although I am almost afraid of mentioning the subject. Motorists, though we hear they are very unpopular, have met the Government in the most fair way. I know that is received with merriment, but it is a fact, and we ought to acknowledge it. There is no suggestion whatever, good, bad or indifferent, as to these roads being motor roads only. They are to be public highways, and as the motorists have met us fairly I think we ought to meet them fairly. They are entitled to consideration. I have only to impress upon the House as respectfully as I can the absolute importance of this clause, and to say that the Government look upon the clause as vital, and hope it will be allowed to remain unchanged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01010"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said there was one point in the noble Earl's speech with which he was prepared to agree, and that was that economy was not the only point to be considered in this matter. If it was clear that the Road Board would be more efficient for its purpose than the Commissioners, added to as he proposed, then be quite admitted that additional expenditure would be justifiable. It was not his opinion that this would be the case, but he recognised that it was a point which might fairly be argued. In the course of the debate on the Bill opinions had been expressed against his proposal. There was one school, he believed, who expected that the institution of a Road Board would lead to the assumption of the cost of maintenance of the main roads of the country by the State. He thought his noble
<col>278</col>
friend Lord Jersey, was a little influenced by that opinion, and certainly his noble friend Lord Belper was so influenced earlier in the evening. It might be that in days to come some Chancellor of the Exchequer would arise who would be prepared to undertake that liability, but he had certainly not had experience in the past of any Chancellor who would do so. He did not believe if they instituted a Road Board they would ever get the State to undertake so great an expenditure as that which was now discharged by the localities on the maintenance of the main roads. Still, he felt there was a great sympathy with the Road Board on that ground, and he quite admitted the force of that feeling.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01011">Then there was the case of the motorist. His noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu had placed that forcibly before the House. He hoped his noble friend would pardon him for suggesting that motorists were rather selfish in the matter because he (Viscount St. Aldwyn) could not trace in his noble friend's speech a feeling for anybody except the motorists. His noble friend alluded to the way in which His Majesty's Government had been met by the motorists. He hardly knew what his noble friend meant. Was the meeting on some backstairs? Where was the agreement arrived at? He need not add his voice to the protest made on that side of the House against the idea that their Lordships could in any way be bound by any agreement of the kind. The additional taxation on motorists had long been due. If the motor industry had been in its present position when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and motorists had used the roads to anything like the extent they did now, he was quite certain he would have imposed additional taxation on them without constituting a Road Board or confining the proceeds of the taxation to the purpose proposed in this Bill. He felt that his argument in favour of the amalgamation of the two boards was weakened by the fact that for reasons to which he had already alluded their Lordships had been induced to agree to the construction and maintenance of new roads by the Road Board. Having that feeling, and bearing in mind the high authority and experience of Lord Jersey, who had spoken against the Amendment, he did not wish to put their Lordships to the trouble of a Division.</p>

<col>279</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01012"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he only intervened to put himself right on one point. If he appeared to express any opinion in favour of the Government taking over main roads he was entirely misunderstood. His view was that there would have to be a new system of trunk roads constructed by the Government, and supported entirely by the Government, but the main roads would continue to be supported as at present by the county councils.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01013"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> wished, before the Amendment was finally withdrawn, to make one observation. The Road Board would be financed out of special taxation on motor cars, and there would be no charge on the public funds.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01024"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> moved an Amendment with the object of ensuring that the expression "improvement of roads" should include the permanent improvement or reconstruction of a road for mitigating the nuisance of dust. He confessed that, looking to the Budget speech, in which this taxation was first introduced to the public notice, and to the subsequent utterances of the Chancellor of the Exchequer he certainly understood the distinct intention was that this fund should be applied entirely for the permanent improvement of the roads and not for mere palliatives such as covering with tar. He rather regretted to see the word "treatment" in the Bill. It was not in the Bill originally, and he believed it was introduced in another place. He was quite sensible to the fact that the attitude of their Lordships, House had not been at all favourable to concessions to motorists, or even to carrying out the understanding that existed, and he did not, therefore, propose to press his Amendment if it was objected to. But he felt that the funds that would be at the disposal of the Road Board might very easily be frittered away, and be expended merely in temporary alleviation of the dust nuisance by such expedients as tar painting, which would have to be renewed two or three times a year. A far more proper method of dealing with the funds would be to apply them to really permanent improvements of the road which would have the effect of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0147"/>
<col>281</col>
mitigating the dust nuisance once and for all. As the amount of money at the disposal of the Board in comparison with the number of miles of road in the country to be dealt with was not very large it would be a pity if the money were wasted, and not put to the best possible use.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01030"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> proposed an Amendment in order to ensure that in connection with the improvement of roads under the Bill the Road Board might make a grant to a highway authority for the freeing of a bridge or the acquisition of a ferry. Obviously, he said, it would be very bad policy on the part of the Road Board to spend a large amount of money in improving a road on both sides of a bridge which was subject to a toll without first relieving the bridge of the toll. Many of their Lordships could no doubt recall instances of toll bridges, and they would agree that in nearly every case had the tolls been taken off
<col>282</col>
before the growth of population took place in the vicinity of those bridges the saving to the public would have been very great. It was obvious that in the case of a road improvement one of the things which it was most necessary to ensure was that the road should not be cut in two, as it were, by a toll-paying bridge, and the same argument would apply in a lesser degree as regarded the acquisition of a ferry.</p>

I hope the noble Lord will be satisfied with that and will not press his proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01033"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said that no doubt a grant for this purpose would have a very beneficial effect, because it was not easy for a county council to give a large sum to free a bridge. Such a grant as was proposed would act as an inducement to those using a toll-paying bridge to contribute to get the bridge freed for the use of ratepayers and others.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01034"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> had some difficulty in understanding in what way the proposal was outside the scope of the Bill, especially as power was given to the Road Board to make a grant to enlarge a bridge. Here the public was in possession of a bridge, with a right of way over it, but there was a certain want of property in the bridge represented by the fact that the people who crossed it had to pay a certain amount of toll. If the bridge were washed away or disappeared from some other cause, there was no question that the Road Board might give a grant to rebuild it. In this case they had a bridge a great part of which belonged to the public, and it was held to be outside the scope of the Bill for the Road Board to give a grant for the acquisition of that portion which was not
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0148"/>
<col>283</col>
in the hands of the public. The object of the Bill was to improve the roads, and the improvement of a road could not be better carried out than by getting rid of what was essentially a hindrance to the traffic. He would not, however, press the Amendment.</p>

He rather gathered in the course of the discussion that the noble Earl admitted, or at any rate did not deny, that the later words of the subsection were inconsistent with the former words, and therefore he proposed to strike them out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01045"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am very much obliged to the noble Marquess for reminding me on this point. Perhaps, if the noble Marquess will agree, the matter had better stand over until Report. It is quite true that the words to which the Duke of Northumberland took exception as to enactments relating to highways and bridges, which he was afraid conflicted with the words which went before, "subject to the same duties as a county council," might be spared; but I do not think it would meet the views of noble Lords opposite to omit the words saying that every road constructed by the Road Board shall be a public highway, because if they were left out the Road Board would be enabled to make one of the great trunk roads into a motor road only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01046"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> observed that as the Road Board was to maintain the roads it should have the powers of a county council for preventing and removing obstructions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01047"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member>
thought it desirable to repeat that the particular Amendment before the House was only a drafting one,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0149"/>
<col>285</col>
and was moved for the purpose of introducing the second Amendment. If their Lordships would consider the matter for a moment merely as business men interested in the roads, without any question of prejudice against the origin of the Bill, or the motorists who were supposed to be at the back of it, he thought they would agree that it would be proper and useful for the Road Board to have the power of making some sort of regulations with regard to the user of these roads. He did not wish it to be supposed that the words he suggested were meant in any way to enable regulations to be made which would close a road to all traffic except motor traffic, or anything of that sort. Motorists were the first to say that they did not wish to have special roads which would be merely motor tracks; but it was not unreasonable when they were trying experiments that there should be some power to regulate the user of the roads. Some of the roads might be sixty or one hundred feet wide as was the case in Kingsway, and it might occur to the Road Board to lay down portions of the road in a different manner. One portion might be constructed in a way which would be suitable to rubber-tyred traffic, another portion might be constructed in the ordinary macadamised way, and a third portion might be constructed with stone setts for the purpose of traction engine traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01048">It was clearly desirable if they were going to make a road of a special character to have plenty of room alongside for ordinary traffic, and there should be power to apply special regulations. These observations applied to ail main roads which were of sufficient width to admit of discriminating treatment. The Highways Act, which now dealt with roads, was a little out of date. The fact was that when they had a track made up anyhow they did not want much in the way of regulations, but they now had special kinds of traffic, and the roads, therefore, must be dealt with in a special manner. A similar experiment was tried on the Champs Elys&#x00E9;es in Paris, where a special section of the roadway had been set apart for motor traffic only. When they looked at the matter from an engineering and construction point of view, he thought their Lordships would admit that it was very proper for them to adapt the Bill to the way in which it was going
<col>286</col>
to be used for making a road in different kinds of ways for different traffic. As their Lordships knew, a very smooth and hard surface, which was suitable for rubber-tyred traffic, was not particularly safe for horse traffic. It might be desirable, for example, on some particular stretch of road where a particular kind of material was being tested for experimental purposes, to forbid the traffic altogether of traction engines which would destroy the value of the experiment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01049">It was not an unreasonable thing to give the Road Board power to make these regulations, which would be subject to the criticism of Parliament. He understood that the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself was not opposed to some regulations of this sort, and, indeed more stringent regulations were suggested in the first instance, but the matter did not receive adequate discussion in another place. It would be a pity, when they were doing a thing of this sort, to spoil the experiment by not giving the people who were conducting it all the powers they required. He did not suggest that the by-laws should be used to exclude any kind of traffic altogether from the roads, but they might be used for the purposes of differentiation. If their Lordships decided to adopt the Amendment and give the Road Board an opportunity of obtaining this power, he had reason to believe that the proposal would be agreed to in another place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01050">The experiments which would be tried in regard to the best methods for the construction of roads might have the result of saving thousands of pounds to the ratepayers. Lord Willoughby de Broke had already been offered by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill all the 220 yards on each side of the road for the purpose of hacking out to cover. He did not think, therefore, there need be any difficulty in allowing the Road Board to make these experiments in a reasonable manner, and to try to see what could be done in the new methods of road construction and the dressing of road surfaces in order to meet the needs of particular kinds of road traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01051"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> entirely supported what the noble Earl opposite had said. He would like to give an instance of how special arrangements were already made in the case of some roads to meet the needs of particular
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0150"/>
<col>287</col>
kinds of traffic. Until very recently on many of the London bridges crossing the Thames there was a sort of plateway at each side which was designed to carry the wheels of very heavy traffic. Supposing the roads were constructed of dustless material, it would be very destructive to the surface if they allowed traction engines to go down the middle of the road under certain conditions. The idea was merely to allow certain kinds of traffic to be confined to the sides of the road, and powers were only those which were asked for by borough councils with regard to approaches to piers and other places. He thought it might safely be left to the Treasury to see that the regulations did not interfere in any way with the access of the public to the roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01052"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I think your Lordships will agree that the two noble Lords have made out a very good case. I was very much struck with what Earl Russell said about the way in which the traffic was managed in Paris, and I believe in that city the method is a great success. But I would remind your Lordships that this question was discussed in the House of Commons. It was brought forward by Mr. Berridge, and, as my noble friend behind me says, it was inadequately discussed. Yet the feeling voiced by Lord Morpeth and others was so strong against the proposal that the matter was dropped. I think on the whole it must be acknowledged that public opinion at the present moment has not advanced so far in this direction as my noble friend has done. Therefore I should hope that he would not press his Amendment at this stage, though as years roll on he may see his wishes bear fruit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01053"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said the Amendment would really enable the Road Board, with the consent of the Treasury, to prohibit all but motor traffic over the whole of these roads.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01054"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> did not know why the noble Viscount should assume that the Treasury would consent to absurd regulations.

<col>288</col>
that was not a sufficient reason why their Lordships should not consider it on its merits. There might be the greatest possible use for these by-laws, and their Lordships could do no harm, if they took that view, in assenting to the Amendment.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01067"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> moved to omit the following words from the first subsection, "and may in addition acquire land on either side of the proposed road, within 220 yards from the middle of the proposed road." He did not think any one realised the extent of the ground that would have to be taken by the Road Board were this proposal passed. He understood it was calculated that if they took 220 yards for a distance of half a mile it would mean forty acres on each side of the road. Therefore it would mean taking eighty acres for every half-mile, which their Lordships would agree was rather a formidable proposition. There appeared to be a great idea in the minds of some people of allowing public bodies to acquire land, and it seemed to him that under this Bill they were embarking upon a very dangerous policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01068">Another question also had to be considered. If the Road Board were empowered to buy large quantities of land on each side of the road they would have it in their power practically to block the neighbouring occupants from getting to the road at all. He asked their Lordships to consider some of the statements made in the Memorandum which had been placed in their hands to explain the Bill, though how much of it held good now he did not know. The Memorandum stated&#x2014;
<quote>"A new road constructed by the Road Board will be primarily a road confined to motor traffic, and the speed limit will not apply on such a road. The Road Board will, however, have power to allow the road to be used for other kinds of traffic if it sees fit, and may impose charges for the use of the road on traffic other than motor traffic."</quote>
Another paragraph a little later on was to the following effect&#x2014;
<quote>"In addition to the power of acquiring land for the purposes of new roads proposed to be constructed by the Road Board, the Board is given power to acquire land in rural districts on either side of any such proposed road to the extent of 220 yards in depth. This power will enable the Road Board to a great extent to reap the increment in value of lands adjoining the new motor roads due to the construction of those roads, and
<col>290</col>
it is hoped that this source of revenue, as well as the charges for allowing private roads leading to houses in the neighbourhood to communicate with the new motor roads, may go some way towards recouping the Road Board for the expenditure on the construction and maintenance of the new motor roads."</quote>
If that was not an extraordinary interference with the right of every individual who lived in the country to use the public roads without being charged by the new Board for getting to those roads, he would like to know what it was. It was all very well to talk about recouping the Road Board, but he was sure that the ratepayers did not want to have motor roads made and then for a charge to be put on themselves for getting to those roads. Their Lordships ought to remember that there was a great possibility that houses might be built between the occupiers of the land at the rear and the road, thus destroying completely their amenities. It was quite unnecessary for the Road Board to acquire land to such a large extent.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01070"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount allows the Road Board to take land compulsorily for the road, but objects to the 220 yards on each side. The noble Viscount puts a very pertinent case. He said that the communication might be cut off between the road and all the <i>hinterland</i> left in the rear of the strip on each side taken by the Road Board. He argued that if the strip was taken it would be very hard for the landowner to have his land shut off from the road altogether. I may remind your Lordships that that point was brought out by Lord Sheffield the other night, and I frankly admit that it ought to be met. There must be some access to the back land, and if the noble Viscount will allow the matter to stand over I will consider it and see what we can do on Report.<lb/>
It may be well to note what is done on the big roads on the Continent. Naturally it is perfectly impossible to live on the road itself, so it is intended there shall be nothing but these strips immediately alongside the road. On the Continent you will find the streets are driven out at right angles, right and left of the roads, and houses are built. The people, therefore,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0152"/>
<col>291</col>
have all the advantages of living on the main road without any of the discomfort of noise and dust, and the other concomitant horrors to which dwellers on motor roads are liable. Of course, we do not and we cannot permit that national money should be given to develop individual estates. I think everybody in the House will agree that that could not be right or fair. If an estate is developed the owner ought to pay a proper share of the cost of the improvement. On the other hand, we have no wish in any way to interfere with the rights of the landlord. I will make a note of the noble Viscount's objection and bring up the question again on Report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01072"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said it seemed to him that the noble Earl did not at all answer his noble friend Lord Galway. The point was not whether the Road Board should have power to make a road across a man's property or not, but whether, in making the road, they should take a tract of land so wide as 440 yards. He took it that the roads on the Continent which the noble Earl referred to were not 440 yards wide or anything like it. What was the necessity of taking that large area of property when a road was made? The noble Earl's argument with reference to developing a man's property at public expense did not apply; because the present proposal was made only in favour of the Road Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01073">Supposing the Road Board made a new road across some country district and took a piece of land 440 yards wide; they might in that process cut off one portion of the landowner's estate entirely from the other, thus depriving his property of all the amenities it would otherwise enjoy and making it absolutely useless for purposes for which it was now used. As to the suggestion of the noble Earl that roads in the rural districts could be lined with villas and shops, it must be apparent to any one that that was a perfect absurdity. If the Road Board
<col>292</col>
chose to make a road to the property of a landowner, of course they were entitled to some advantage and that advantage should be obtained by making some charge to the landowner for access to the road, or by making him pay something for any improvement to his property, to be ascertained in the manner provided in the Schedule. All that would be perfectly fair; but why this extraordinary provision permitting 220 yards of land to be taken on each side of a road should be proposed except as part of the idea of the nationalisation of land he could not understand.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01074"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: There is no intention to put in the thin end of the wedge of land nationalisation. This is a new idea in this country, and, as is always the case with new ideas, there is thought to be hidden danger in it. In America land has always been bought on each side of the railway. There is really nothing new in the principle of the proposal. I am at a loss to understand the great alarm of noble Lords opposite. It would not interfere with a man's property. On the contrary, a road going through some of our agricultural properties would do an immense deal of good. I should welcome the proposal in the case of some parts of my own property, because it would be developed and increased in value to a very considerable extent. I cannot understand why there should be this terror of this proposal, because if there was any severance of the estate the landlord would be paid at a proper price for that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01075"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said the noble Earl did not see any possible reason why the authority should not hold land. The view which noble Lords on the other side took appeared to be that in the case of local authorities the more land they held the better. There was, however, a good deal of risk of loss to the ratepayers in pursuing a policy of that kind. He would mention an instance of this which was within his own recollection. The London County Council in one case bought land largely on each side of the road in connection with an improvement, with the result that they had now property of the value of six millions which they could not sell. They thought to recoup themselves for the improvement which was effected and bought far more land than they needed
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0153"/>
<col>293</col>
when they made the road. The result was, however, that for years the London County Council had paid &#x00A3;200,000 in interest; and that had been done at the expense of the ratepayers, who were the sufferers by the miscalculation. It seemed to him the idea was that they were to take a great wedge of land through half a county in order that at some future time the Government might reap increment value on it. Their Lordships ought to be informed what was the minimum of land really required for these new roads, and they should not sanction any proposal which might involve a serious loss and which would be burdensome on landowners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01076"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think that a somewhat unnecessary amount of prejudice has been imported into the discussion of this question. The proposal of His Majesty's Government is undoubtedly one way of arriving at the process of betterment. The other way is the one which we had in the Housing Bill, a measure to which the noble Duke opposite referred as being in some way kindred to this Bill. It was strongly disapproved of by noble Lords opposite, and received the kind of treatment to which we are accustomed in the case of such proposals at the hands of noble Lords. The kind of betterment which was to be found in the Housing Bill is disapproved of. This is a different kind. Supposing you do not put something of the kind in the Bill, what happens? You reach this absurd result. Entirely at the public expense a road is made straight from Liverpool to Manchester, or from Birmingham to Wolverhampton. The land up to that time had only the most remote building value, but great blocks of it now become of the highest building value. As regards the land away from the main road, the landlord has to make the roads himself at his own cost, but you give him that splendid frontage for nothing. That seems a most strange and illogical proceeding. It is quite true there may be some other ways of arriving at the same result, and the area capable of being taken would no doubt only be desired to be taken in very rare cases. It must be remembered that it has to be paid for, and in many cases at a very high price. Then in running a road through agricultural districts I cannot imagine that as a rule the Road Board would wish to acquire any land at all. If noble Lords do not like our way of achieving the result which is aimed at they
<col>294</col>
can suggest something else; but we cannot admit that in every case where a road is made entirely at the public expense it is reasonable, in view of the opinions which are held not only by people of extreme Socialistic views but by people of moderate views on these matters, to hand over the whole of the value, which may be enormous, to the landlord without his making any contribution whatever towards the cost of constructing the road.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01077"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> did not want to revive the controversy over the Housing Bill, but there was no one in the House who defended the betterment proposal which the Government put forward in that Bill. It was universally condemned, and yet, though it was not defended by the Government themselves, it was a proposal which the noble Earl taunted the Opposition with not accepting. As regarded the present proposal, what they had to say was that if this were a Housing Bill it would, perhaps, be right and proper that they should consider what the enhanced value of the frontages might be to the landowners. But when one of these roads went through a country district it would if anything tend to deteriorate rather than to advance the value of the land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01078"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Why only through a country district?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01079"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said that in dealing with an urban district the Town Planning Bill was the proper measure to proceed under. In dealing with country districts under the Development Bill the noble Earl must remember the sort of confusion that would result from all sorts of motors rushing backwards and forwards over improved roads. It seemed to him that the result would be worsement, if he might use such a word, rather than betterment owing to the loss that would be caused to the landowner by reason of the spoiling of what would otherwise be a nice building estate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01080"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> could imagine that even where the roads passed through rural districts the frontage value would in many cases be considerably increased. Supposing a special road were made from London to Brighton, the frontages would everywhere be of great value and houses would spring up everywhere on the route.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0154"/>
<col>295</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01081"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: No one would ever dream of building on such a road.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01082"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> said there was no principle of private legislation more clear and certain than that when a town improvement was effected and a new street made the local authority was to have the frontage as well as the road itself in order that the full value given by the improvement might accrue to that authority. The clause was necessary for the logical extension of that principle to suburban and rural districts, and he hoped His Majesty's Government would adhere to their proposal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01083"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> thought when he heard Lord Carrington replying to the arguments of Viscount Galway that he had been convinced by them and was going to consider the question of the road frontages when the Bill came up on Report. But he now understood that all the noble Earl was going to consider was the means of giving access to people who became sort of backwoodsmen by the taking of these strips of land between their property and the road. He was very sorry that the noble Earl was not disposed to go fully into the matter and he rather agreed with the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, that it was gravely to be questioned whether any one who owned land in a country district would, under the circumstances, find his property improved in value by the construction of these roads. When the noble Marquess made that remark the noble Earl the Leader of the House at once interjected "Why only in country districts," leaving it to be assumed that the object of providing for these large strips was to enable land to be bought in urban districts where it would be very expensive and its acquisition would cripple very much the beneficial operations of the Road Board. As he was anxious to see the Road Board entrusted with as much money as possible for what he conceived to be the properly defined duties which their Lordships had more or less settled that it should exercise, he was very much averse to the Board engaging in land purchase operations of a speculative kind which might end disastrously and prejudice its powers, of useful work in other directions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01084"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member> said the noble Marquess opposite appeared
<col>296</col>
to think that no one would want to live near a motor road, and that if a road were constructed through the property of a landowner the result would be not betterment, but worsement. The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, had really given the answer to that argument, because his view was not at all the same as that of his noble friend. The noble Viscount, who was a business man and had experience of property, said it was very hard for the land behind the strips that were taken to be shut off from the roads and that the properties should be deprived of all their amenities. The two noble Lords, therefore, were actually answering one another The question had been asked why the right to acquire frontages should only be given where a road was constructed by the Road Board. The answer to that was that where a road was made by a local authority the cost of construction fell upon the ratepayers, and the landowners in the districts were necessarily rated on a large scale for the improvement. In that case it was fair that the frontages should not be taken from a landowner. But when the road was constructed and frontages were created entirely out of moneys provided by Parliament, surely there was a fair claim on the part of the public that they should be allowed to take at a valuation those pieces of land, which previously had not been frontages at all. He agreed that there would be a great value in those frontages in the neighbourhood of many towns, and when Parliament had given local authorities like the county councils power to take land for betterment purposes he did not see why the power should not be given to the Road Board in the present instance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01085"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> considered that the question of laying out estates and building houses did not arise at all under this Bill. If there were improvements to be effected in that direction the Housing and Town Planning Bill would be available for carrying them out. He objected strongly to any attempt being made to turn the Road Board into a jerry-building and speculative body.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01086"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> said that supposing a road of the kind contemplated in the Bill were going to be constructed by a private commercial syndicate the first thing they would attempt to do would be to get by means of an Act of Parliament a sufficient amount of land on either side of the road to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0155"/>
<col>297</col>
ensure that the scheme would be a benefit to them. The frontages of these roads would in many cases have a great value for shops for trading purposes, and it was an extraordinary proposition to say that if there was an advantage the State, which was making the road, should not enjoy that advantage. He doubted whether the fear of noble Lords as to the worsement and depreciation in value of these strips was so</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01087">Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01088"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> moved to insert in subsection (5), after the words "Schedule to this Act," a proviso to the effect that "the provisions of Part I of the Act prohibiting the compulsory acquisition of the classes of land mentioned in subsection (2) of section five of this Act shall apply to the acquisition by the Road Board of land for the purpose of the construction of a new road." He said that in moving this Amendment he was guided by what had been provided for in Clause 5, which stated that "No land shall be authorised by an order under this section to be acquired compulsorily which, at the date of the order, forms part of any park, garden, or pleasure ground,</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01094"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: This matter was thrashed out on the Small Holdings Bill, where in the case of a home farm it was decided to prevent the construction of a new road through the land adjoining the house, but not to compel the taking a long or inconvenient detour. Clause 5 does not apply to the construction of a road but to the 220 yards which has been struck out of the Bill. The difficulty of the noble Viscount's proviso would be found in an extreme case, such as in a road to be taken across a railway. The Road Board could not get across the line either by a bridge, or a subway, or still less by a level crossing, and that would put a stop to the road altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01095"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> was afraid the Amendment was open to the objection raised by the noble Earl. But there was another objection.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01103"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I hope your Lordships will not accept this Amendment. This subsection goes a great deal too far. We must have the right to purchase land opposite the road, otherwise the road would come to an abrupt conclusion.

In a case where a water company are bound to protect their water supply an easement would hardly be sufficient for the purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01104"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> saw no reason why one public undertaking should give up land to another public undertaking, except by the authority of Parliament. That principle was enforced throughout the Housing Bill. But there was a difficulty in the case where a railway or canal lay in the route of the road. That evidently ought not to stop the road; they might have to go either over or under the railway, and that would be provided for by the word "easement," which, in fact, would provide everything necessary to meet contingencies.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01150"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member>, who had an Amendment on the Paper to omit Clause 18, said that since putting it down he had seen an Amendment by the Marquess of Salisbury which he desired to support. By his Amendment to leave out the clause he did not desire to suggest that regard should not be had to the state of employment; but the direction as it stood in the Bill had been misinterpreted, and might be misinterpreted in the future. He was anxious that
<col>304</col>
the work under the Bill should not be carried out with undue expense. He would not, however, move his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01151"><member>The MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> then moved the omission of Clause 18, in order to insert a new clause providing that, in the execution of any work already approved which involved the employment of labour on a considerable scale, regard should be had to the general state and prospects of employment. He was anxious that nothing should be done by the operation of the Bill which could come under the scope of relief works, which had been universally condemned by the High Court; and with a view to translating the noble Earl's emphatic assurance, given on the Second Reading, into concrete shape, he had tabled his Amendment. If Clause 18 had been struck out the Commissioners or road authority would say that it was intended by Parliament that no notice should be taken of unemployment. Whilst they agreed that there must be nothing in the shape of relief works, it would be well if in the arrangement of the time at which the work should be executed some relief could be afforded to unemployment. He had expressly set out that the approval of the work must be independent to the question of unemployment.</p>

They could be taken for the purposes of forestry or the making of roads without the consent of Parliament, or without anything being given in exchange. It seemed very wrong for that to be done, because in the present state of public opinion no railway company would venture to apply to Parliament for such powers. It was some time since commons had been cut up into ribbons by a railway, and that was simply because public opinion was so decidedly against it. He hoped the Government would not attempt to do what they would not permit a railway company to do.</p>

With the idea I am in sympathy; but does not the Amendment go too far? Take the forest of Brecknock, which has an area of many square miles and is well suited to forestry. Are the public to be shut off from that portion where trees are growing up? The interference would be quite unimportant; because different parts are planted at different times. There would be no intention of preserving it for game, or to interfere in any way with the pleasure of the public, and it would certainly be better and much pleasanter for the public when it is planted. Is it reasonable to say that no common land is to be taken on any terms? The addition of a few feet to a road would not hurt a common.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01246">On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01247"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> moved to amend subsection (1) of Clause 4, which ran&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01248">4.&#x2014;(1) Regulations may be made by the Lord Lieutenant under subsection (8) of section twenty-three of the Act of 1903 for determining the priority in which advances, whether by means of money or of stock, or partly by means of money and partly by means of stock, may be sanctioned; and for allocating as between different classes of sales the total amounts from time to time available for advances; but such allocation shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, preserve the priority in which purchase agreements have been lodged with the Land Commission,</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01249">by omitting the words "but such allocation shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, preserve the priority in which purchase agreements have been lodged with the Land Commission," and inserting the words "Provided, however, that the priority of cases shall, as far as practicable, be regulated by the date at which the proceedings in each case were commenced in the Land Commission, the Land Judge's Court, and in the offices of the Congested Districts Board respectively, and in case of dispute as to such date it shall be referred to the Judicial Commissioner, whose decision shall be final."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01250">He desired to leave out the words in question because difficulties would obviously arise if they were left in, as they would only apply to one class of cases&#x2014;namely, to the class of cases in which there had been a sale direct to the tenants by the landlord. He
<col>316</col>
was informed that though these words created a system which would be perfectly practicable in such cases, the words were not general enough, as they did not apply to all cases. They excluded cases such as those of sales direct to the Land Commission or cases in which the sale had been through the Court of the Land Judge. Therefore he asked their Lordships to omit the words, with the object of inserting the words as printed in his Amendment, which would ensure that, estates being the unit, cases should always date from the first step taken in connection with the sale&#x2014;the first step, that was to say, in filing the cases before the proper authorities. There were various names for this first step. It was known, he believed, as an originating application in the case of a direct sale, as an originating request in the case of a sale direct to the Land Commission, and as a proposal to tenants before the Land Judge in other cases, and so on. The words "regulated by the date at which the proceedings in each case were commenced" would carry out what he thought was the intention of their Lordships in inserting this Amendment on Report.</p>

</member><membercontribution>: So far as the omission of the words put in by the noble Viscount at a former stage and the substitution of others are concerned, we quite agree that the noble Earl's words are more appropriate from his point of view; but I should like to ask him whether he has satisfied himself that the line of proceeding which I think is generally agreed should be taken under our financial proposals is not gravely interfered with by this Amendment. The words which cause me to say this are "as far as practicable." The plan which we had in our minds for the allocation of the various cases under different heads is quite familiar to the noble Earl, and I am sure I need not repeat it, but I do not think that the words "so far as practicable" would
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0165"/>
<col>317</col>
enable the Commissioners to make regulations which would enable cases to be determined not by their priority in the whole list of cases that had been lodged, but their priority in the particular class to which they belonged, and I am sure that noble Lords will see that if you interfere with that classification you destroy the basis on which the division into cash payments, payments in part cash and part stock, and all stock payments, is made.<lb/>
For instance, in a case of this kind you have one vendor, A, who decides to take all cash; B decides to take half cash and half stock. The moment that they reach that decision those two cease to be in any competition because they belong to different classes, and once they have made that decision their relative priority ceases to be at all operative. The noble Earl will understand what I mean. If you maintain the priority between those two on the whole list of applications, you may keep B back, although the Estates Commissioners are quite ready to consider his case, because on the total list he is behind A, although he is on a par with A once you divide the list into different classes. To put the thing another way. Suppose that on the half stock and half cash list there is enough money to make the advance to B in his priority on that list, but there is not enough cash in the cash list to make an advance at the moment to A, who holds a position of priority on the purely cash list; it is not reasonable to ask B to wait until cash can be found to pay A off in cash. Once the different classes have been divided, you must cease to make them competitive with each other; otherwise your system of classification cannot possibly work. And for this reason. I may remind the House once more that the inducement to go either for half stock or whole stock is the fact that a man gets a priority in his class. If he is not going to get that, of course he may just as well wait and take cash altogether. Therefore, we think that the insertion of the words proposed positively endangers the plan of regulations which I have explained to the House, and I hope, therefore, the noble Earl will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01253"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said the words in the Amendment were "Provided, however, that the priority of cases shall, as far as practicable," etc. So far as he could see, the argument of the noble Earl in charge of
<col>318</col>
the Bill was that he did not think the Amendment practicable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01254"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Earl's pardon. It is because it is practicable to take them in their precise order without reference to their classification that I object to the words. It would end by destroying the classification altogether. You cannot say that it is not practicable to do it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01255"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> thought the date at which the proceedings in each case were commenced should be taken into consideration when allocating these moneys. Notwithstanding what the noble Earl had said about A having cash and B taking half cash and half stock, they surely could not leave out of consideration the date at which those cases were begun. He quite followed what the noble Earl had said as to the difficulty of this matter, and that in dotting the i's and crossing the t's rather more latitude should be given to the Estates Commissioners. That he quite understood; but in their opinion the Estates Commissioners had enough latitude already. That was the reason why the Amendment was proposed, and he supported it. The noble Earl had referred to A as taking all cash, and said that if there was not enough cash to pay him, then B would come in and would get his half cash and half stock. He thought that was a reason why they should have the allocation more clearly stated in the Bill. After all, they did not look with very great favour upon stock, but they did look with a great deal of favour upon cash.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01256"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> quite recognised that the Government found this a difficult point and its solution by no means easy; but there was a further element which embarrassed the question&#x2014;namely, that in addition to the matters stated by the noble Earl there was the element of the cash to be found for compulsory purchase. Did that displace any priorities that were on the sub-lists? There were rules at present in existence in reference to priority, and if the Government would print what were their present rules on the subject and take power to change and alter them, the House would know what was in the minds of the Government on the matter, and the Government would be left perfect freedom of action to change the rules whenever they thought it reasonable or right to do so.</p>

<col>319</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01257"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I gather that the noble Earl prefers the words now moved by Lord Donoughmore to the words which are at present in the Bill, without, of course, in any way committing himself to approval of the principle of the Amendment; but he suggests to the House that whichever form of words is adopted, the adoption of them may endanger the basis upon which these regulations will proceed. May I put it to the noble Earl that the worst thing that could happen under this Amendment of my noble friend would be that it would prove to some extent ineffectual for the purpose at which he desires to arrive. The noble Earl's point is this, and I think it is a perfectly good one, that as between these three classes into which the applicants will be grouped it is impossible to guarantee that there shall be priority depending upon the date of the original inception of the proceedings. The applicant may take a passage upon a fast train or a slow train, or a train that goes at a medium pace, and according as he takes a place in the one train or the other, his priority will be greater or less as compared with the priority of others. We all admit that anything like a rigid application of the doctrine of "first come first served" is impossible; but still my noble friend attaches importance to these words because they will be a general indication that so far as is practicable, because that is the reservation which he makes, this principle of priority should be observed. I therefore put it to the noble Earl that the worst thing that can be said about my noble friend's Amendment is that it may not produce such good results as he expects. On the other hand, I think we may say it will be entirely innocuous, and I cannot see why it should in any way embarrass those who will have to give effect to the regulations under this subsection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01258"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: This is the Bill, but the regulations are not in the Bill. What the noble Earl means is "so far as is practicable" within the regulations which may be made. But, if he does not say so, would not anybody whose order of priority was broken have a remedy against the Estates Commissioners, on the wording of this clause? He would say, "I know nothing about regulations. All I see is that the Act of Parliament provides that so far as is practicable I must be taken in my turn, and I am not taken in my turn. It was quite practicable to take me in my turn." If the regulations were in the Bill, the noble
<col>320</col>
Marquess's reasoning would, I think, be correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01259"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Would not the answer be that the text of the Bill laid it down that priority was to be observed as far as practicable, and that that, therefore, completely covered the authorities who framed the regulations and who found that the "first come first served" principle could not be adopted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01260"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It may be so, but I confess I am afraid of the phrase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01261"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> asked whether it would meet the noble Earl's point if he inserted the words "in the making of such regulations." The proviso would then read&#x2014;"Provided, however, that in the making of such regulations the priority of cases shall as far as practicable," etc.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01262"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: If you say that, the regulations themselves would be governed by the direction that there is to be a priority according to time, and you would destroy the three classes. But the point might be met by the proviso commencing, "Provided, however, that subject to such regulations relating to the priority of different classes the priority of cases, shall, as far as practicable, be regulated," etc.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01263"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said he would gladly accept the noble and learned Lord's suggestion. He would also insert before the word "practicable" the word "reasonably."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01264">On Question, Amendment, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01265"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>, in moving his second Amendment to Clause 4, said their Lordships would remember that on Report the noble Earl in charge of the Bill moved an Amendment stating that the regulations were to be laid before Parliament. He desired to go a step further and to provide that those regulations should lie on the Table of this and the other House of Parliament for a certain time, and that their Lordships should have the usual power of moving an Address against anything which was objected to. He did not think it would be necessary to explain the procedure. It was well known to their Lordships.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0167"/>
<col>321</col>
A similar procedure was already provided for by the Government in another part of the Bill. The Government had themselves taken practically the same words from the Act of 1881 which he in his Amendment took from that Act, only they applied the procedure to a different class of cases. The last two lines of his Amendment, "This section shall apply only to cases arising under Sections 1 to 7 inclusive of the Act of 1903," were, perhaps, a little difficult to understand. The object of that subsection was to make it quite clear that certain classes of cases should be excluded which obviously ought to be excluded. There were, as a matter of fact, five such classes. This Amendment was merely an extension of a system of procedure which had been adopted by the Government in another part of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01266">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 3, line 19, after the word 'made,' to insert the words' if Parliament be then sitting, and if Parliament be not then sitting, within three Weeks after the beginning of the then next Session of Parliament; and if an Address is presented to His Majesty by either House of Parliament within the next subsequent one hundred days on which the said House shall have sat, praying that any such regulation may he annulled.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01268"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think I before stated that we do not think this Amendment a desirable one, and for this reason. It may fairly be argued that regulations of this kind should be subject to Parliamentary criticism, but we do not think that they are suitable for direct Parliamentary amendment. The noble Earl will recognise that if you give a power of repealing anything to Parliament, you in the last resort give a power of amendment, because it means by an exhaustive process that the Irish Government of the day may go on proposing regulation after regulation, and one House of Parliament&#x2014;your Lordships' House for
<col>322</col>
instance&#x2014;decides to consider each as it conies, with the ultimate intention and possibly the ultimate result of getting the regulations framed in the way that you yourselves decide. We do not think that these extremely technical points are in reality suitable to Parliamentary amendment, however properly in a conceivable case, if anything which was considered unfair was supposed to be done, they might be subject to Parliamentary criticism. I am aware that the noble Earl sets great store by this Amendment, and I certainly should not propose to divide the House against it. As regards his proposed subsection (3), why, for instance, should compulsory sales under this Act be excluded from consideration in these regulations, and they certainly would be? Neither do I see myself why sales of individual holdings should be excluded, as they would be. They are sold through the Estates Commissioners in various cases. It only shows how difficult it is to get these priorities and all these things into an Act of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01269"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> could not help thinking that the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had exaggerated the part which Parliament was likely to take in consequence of an Order of this kind. If their Lordships would look at the cases in which this power had been given they would find that it had only been exercised in very extreme cases, and he did not think the noble Earl could produce an instance in which either House of Parliament, because it wished that some particular regulation should be made, had gone on negativing regulation after regulation after it had been laid on the Table. It seemed to him that this objection really existed more in the noble Earl's mind than in any practice that had hitherto taken place. It seemed to him that what had just been done rather strengthened the case for the application of this particular form in this particular instance, because the Amendment which had just been accepted provided that subject to the regulations which might be made the priority of cases should be regulated by the date at which the proceedings in each case were commenced. That, of course, placed the whole power in the regulations, and therefore made it more desirable that Parliament should possess the power of at all events inspecting and observing what had been done, while retaining the power to interfere in an extreme case if it should be found that the regulations were not such as in the opinion of Parliament was
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0168"/>
<col>323</col>
just. Of course, it was not desirable that a procedure of this kind should be applied in every case. When regulations were trivial and small, they were not such as to require the attention of Parliament, so far at least as the power of rejection was concerned, and it might be quite sufficient that they should lie on the Table as was now proposed in the Bill; but these regulations being, as they were, very important and likely to produce important results, it was surely right that Parliament should retain power of watching over what was done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01270">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01271"><member>THE EARL OF KENMARE</member> moved to add to Clause 5 the following new subsection&#x2014;
<quote>(5) Any vendor may agree to advances being made in bills or bonds issued under this section as in the case of stock under section three on conditions prescribed by the Treasury.</quote>
The object of his Amendment was to enable vendors who so willed it to accept payment from the Treasury in short notes. Under the law as it stood, even if the Treasury were willing to give these notes to vendors, the tenants for life would not be legally entitled to accept them. It would be of enormous advantage to landlords in a great many cases if they could receive these short notes bearing interest at two and three-quarters per cent. It would be voluntary on the part of the Treasury to give the notes. The Amendment was merely to make the process legal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01272">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 4, line 2, after subsection (4), to insert the following new subsection&#x2014;</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01273">'(5) Any vendor may agree to advances being made in bills or bonds issued under this section as in the case of stock under section three on conditions prescribed by the Treasury.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Kenmare.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01274"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has brought forward his Amendment in a somewhat different form from what he did in the Committee stage. Then he made it compulsory, at the request of the vendor, for the Treasury to issue these bills or bonds. I think the noble Earl has not quite understood why this provision was put into the Bill. It was not done in any way as an alternative method for paying vendors. It was simply done to enable the Treasury to raise money in this way for payments in cash instead of issuing stock for the purpose
<col>324</col>
if the state of the market rendered it undesirable at the time. It is simply part of the arrangement for paying vendors in cash and, therefore, so far as the noble Earl's point is concerned, the vendor would gain nothing, because as soon as the transaction is actually concluded he gets his cash, and he cannot get anything, either bonds or bills or anything else, until the transaction is concluded. One reason which would make it undesirable from the Treasury point of view to issue these bills or bonds to the Land Commission is that their price, as the noble Earl very well knows, varies markedly and rapidly, and the probable duration of the bills thus issued would, as I understand, be not more than a year, although power is taken to issue bills or bonds for a longer term. I am therefore given to understand that the Treasury would not agree to the noble Earl's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01275"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said it was difficult to follow the noble Earl's view. It seemed to him that the matter was hardly understood. If the duration of the bond came into the matter at all it came into it in the question of whether or not the Treasury should issue the bonds, but apparently the Treasury thought it desirable or His Majesty's Government would not have introduced the power into the Bill. If the power was once introduced into the Bill, he failed to see why the Government should not take full advantage of the obvious pecuniary benefit they would get from the issue of the bonds. If they issued these bonds, it would be because they got a higher price in the market for them than for stock. Take the present position. The two and three-quarters per cent. Irish Land Stock stood at eighty-five; the two and three-quarters per cent. Government obligations on these short bonds stood at ninety-eight or ninety-nine. The Government might think it undesirable to issue such bonds at all, but if they did think it desirable, they certainly would not desire to put a larger amount on the market than they could help, and every bond which was accepted by the vendors relieved the market to a certain extent. All that his noble friend asked was this. The Government intended to issue stock instead of cash in a certain number of cases, but the Government proposed to deprive themselves of the power of issuing a bond which would be more acceptable to vendors than stock, and at the same time would least depreciate
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0169"/>
<col>325</col>
their own security. Seeing that the whole matter was permissive and that the Government would not issue bonds unless they found that it was thoroughly safe, he thought it was most unwise to debar themselves from the advantage of being able to issue them to Irish landlords in place of issuing cash. He hoped the noble Earl would reconsider his objection to the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01276">On Question, Amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01277"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> moved the insertion of a new clause after Clause 5. This was the point which the noble Earl was good enough to say he would reconsider if the Amendment were placed in as a permissive Amendment. The object of the new clause was to enable the authorities to accept payment in stock where they were willing to do so; and having in view the fact that a large number of transactions between landlords and the Government had to be made at present in cash although the landlord might be forced to accept stock, it certainly would seem desirable, in respect of the obligations which he had to the Government, that he should be in the position, if the Government accepted it, to tender stock in place of cash.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01278">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"After Clause 5, to insert the following new clause&#x2014;</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01279">'4. Where a vendor, under future purchase agreements receives payment in stock instead of in cash, all charges, duties, incumbrances, and redemption prices of quit-rents, tithe rent-charge, or other superior interests payable out of the purchase-money to the Crown, the Land Commission, the Commissioners of Public Works or any Public Department, may be received and paid in stock upon the like terms as payment in stock was received by the vendor, and it shall be lawful for the Land Judge, and the Judges of the Chancery Division, and for any trustees, in respect of any sums payable out of the purchase-money into Court or to such trustees, to accept payment in stock on the like terms as payment was received by the vendor.'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Midleton.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01280"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I have been in communication with the Treasury on this point. The point, I take it, of the noble Viscount is this, that it may at some time be so undesirable from the view of the Exchequer to flood the market with stock which has to be turned into cash for the purpose of paying off a charge, that the Treasury would actually prefer that the Crown should be paid off in stock rather than in cash. I am given to understand
<col>326</col>
that the amounts which at any one time could be put on the market for this purpose are not such as to run the risk of disturbing the market in the manner which the noble Viscount appears to fear. The noble Viscount has on this occasion not laid any stress on the words "for any trustees," which are of a rather wide nature. He proposes that it shall be lawful for the Land Judge and the Judges of the Chancery Division and for any trustees in respect of any sums payable out of the purchase money into Court or to such trustees, to accept payment in stock on the like terms as payment was received by the vendor. That is giving to trustees a power to accept a security of less value than cash, and it certainly does seem to me to be a remarkable provision to place in an Act of Parliament. Therefore so far as the mere question of payments to the Crown is concerned, we do not think that the power is worth having, and so far as the question of payment to trustees is concerned we object to it as being altogether removed from precedent in any Act of Parliament which we can remember.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01281"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said this had been argued several times on his initiative and on that of other members of their Lordships' House; but he could assure the noble Earl that it was a far larger question than the Treasury seemed to think. They might not have many cases in view at the moment under which they expected that there would have to be sales for redemption but these superior interests were found in connection with the Irish land system in an infinitely greater degree than noble Lords living in England, Scotland, and Wales would be accustomed to. He had made careful inquiries into the matter and had come to the conclusion that superior interests amounting to as much as twenty-five per cent. of the gross rents represented merely an average state of affairs in connection with an Irish estate and an estate on which there were no mortgages whatever. He would have thought, therefore, that it was most desirable that some such enabling power as was given in this Amendment should be inserted in the Bill, and he confessed it was with very considerable regret that he heard the decision of the Government that they were going to force this stock on the market, because he thought it would do them indirectly a great deal more harm than this concession if accepted.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0170"/>
<col>327</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01282"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said quit rents was a very old charge and were redeemed at the enormous price of twenty-five years purchase. Tithe rents were redeemed at twenty-two and a-half years purchase. If they had to pay cash and take stock and to sell stock to pay these charges, it really was not quite fair. He hoped the noble Earl would see his way to accept the Amendment, even if all words were deleted after the word "vendor." That would do away with the difficulty which the noble Earl had raised with regard to trustees.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01284"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member><membercontribution> said the words which he proposed to omit from the beginning of subsection (2) of Clause 12 were superfluous, and, being superfluous, were apt to be mischievous. For instance, a voluntary agreement entered into with the Congested Districts Board would not be made "at the request of the Land Commission," and as such would not come under the provisions of the clause at all.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01286"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: As the clause stands, the kind of case which is intended to be met is as follows. The landlord has agreed with his tenants to sell on certain terms. Then the Land Commission inspect the estate, and, owing to its particular circumstances, find that it would be one which they consider would be suitable to be sold to them or to the Congested Districts Board, with a view, say, of distributing untenanted land, and the improvement of holdings, and so on. Then they inform the vendor of this and ask him to sell to them instead of selling direct to the tenants. Then the vendor, hearing this, makes a new arrangement with the Estates Commissioners. It would be very hard upon everybody concerned if that new arrangement had to be carried out on terms less advantageous than the old agreement. Therefore, this clause says that when, at the request of the Land Commission, this change is made and the sale to the Commissioners is instituted, the terms shall be the old terms. Why should a vendor who has entered into an agreement
<col>328</col>
with his tenants be allowed to change his mind and sell to the Land Commission, not at their request, simply because it may suit him better to do so? It seems to me that the fact that the Land Commission have asked for the land is a justification for breaking the original agreement: but if they have not done so, I confess it seems to me hard that the agreement should be in any way broken.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01288"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> called attention to the existence in the clause of the words "or the Congested Districts Board," which appeared to him to be out of place in the Bill as it now stood. The clause ran "Where a vendor, at the request of the Land Commission, enters into an agreement with the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board," etc. The vendor would no longer, under the Bill as it now stood, enter into an agreement with the Congested Districts Board. It seemed to him, therefore, that the words "or the Congested Districts Board" and also the words "or board" later on were out of place.</p>

If the clause was passed in its present form a state of confusion would arise in the case of agreements signed by vendor and purchaser, which, although they formed valid contracts between the parties, could not for some good reason be lodged in the Estates Commissioners' Office. There were cases of deaths, of boundary difficulties, title, etc., which had sometimes prevented this taking place, and there was hardly an estate where there were not such cases. If the words "entered into" were used instead of "lodged with the

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01293"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry again to have to say that I cannot agree to the Amendment of the noble Earl opposite, because, as the noble Earl, I think, will see, the financial operations of the Bill depend in a marked degree upon the distinctions which it has been felt necessary to draw between pending agreements and future agreements. As the clause stands, pending agreements means agreements lodged with the Land Commission on or before the 15th day of September of this year, and the words apply to agreements for direct sales entered into between landlord and tenant. The only definitely ascertainable date, as it seems to me, that you can find is the date of lodgment. How is it possible to ascertain at what date in many cases the agreements have been really entered into? Of course it would be most material to everybody to prove, if they could, that the agreement had been entered into before September 15, and it would be very hard to say what degree of informal communication might not be regarded, if those words were inserted, as an entering into of the agreement.<lb/>
The noble Viscount on the Front Bench opposite asked me on the last stage of the Bill what was the legal position of tenants who at this moment and before the passing of the Bill proposed to come in. What, he asked, was the position of those who came in before the passing of the Act. The words must be carefully read. The phrase is "lodged with the Land Commission on or
<col>330</col>
before the 15th day of September." The noble Viscount then said that&#x2014;
<quote>"a tenant who chose to come in before this Art was passed would be debarred in future from coming in at three and a-quarter per cent. He was entitled to come in at three and a-quarter per cent. now, and therefore the date which had been put in, 15th September, was practically <i>ultra vires</i>."</quote>
The noble Viscount could not have meant <i>ultra vires</i> in the strict sense, because nothing is <i>ultra vires</i>, in an Act of Parliament; but what the noble Viscount did mean was that it put a retrospective disability on the tenant which he did not conceive to be a fair thing to do. That, I take it, is what the noble Viscount really meant, and it certainly is the case that the 15th of September and the lodging of the agreement must be taken as the two determining factors in the case of the tenant just as in the case of the landlord&#x2014;that is to say, that unless the agreement has been lodged before September 13, the tenant will come in on the worse terms. The noble Viscount, I am afraid, must take it from me that that is so. I fear we cannot, for the reasons I have stated, accept the noble Earl's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

It might seem desirable to provide a holding for one of a large family of sons, but it seemed to him that in the case of an only son this could not be considered desirable. The only son would eventually succeed to the holding in the occupation of his father, and if this clause became law and under it he received a new holding during his father's lifetime, on his father's death he would find himself the proud possessor of two holdings. That, he submitted was contrary to the principle of the Bill, and the words he proposed to

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01299"><member>LORD BARRYMORE</member>, in moving the insertion in Clause 31 of a new subsection to provide that the provisions of Section 67, subsection (3), of the Act of 1903, should not apply to any land or holding subject to a purchase annuity unless the Land Commission deemed it expedient, said he hoped the noble Earl in charge of the Bill would take the same view of his Amendment as he had done of the last, as it was a very simple and harmless one. It was rather technical, however, and in form somewhat objectionable, because it was legislation by reference. Its whole object was to leave it in the discretion of the Land Commission whether they would or would not enforce the provisions of subsection (3) of Section 67 of the Act of 1903, the terms of which were mandatory. He was told that the mandatory character of the subsection had worked unreasonably in many cases. Under Section 30 of the Act of 1881 a tenant purchaser could not subdivide his holding without the consent of the Land Commission, who only gave their consent when they were satisfied that they ought to do so. When they did consent to subdivision, by the Act of 1896 they apportioned the annuity on the divided portions of the holding, and if the interest in one of those portions should be purchased by another tenant purchaser, his holding and his annuity must be consolidated into one with the portion he had purchased or which had been conveyed to him with the annuity attached thereto. In practice that was sometimes neither convenient nor reasonable; for instance, a portion might have been bought up by the tenant purchaser with the intention of transferring it later on to one of his sons as a provision for him. On the whole, it would be convenient that the apportionment under the provisions of Section 67, subsection (3), of the Act of
<col>332</col>
1903 should be in the discretion of the Land Commission, instead of being as at present obligatory. Their Lordships would see that the proposed new subsection gave elasticity; it placed power in the hands of the Land Commission and would enable them to deal justly and equitably with such cases as came before them.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01310"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved a new clause after Clause 40 for the purpose of adding to the Congested Districts Board a paid member, nominated by the Lord Lieutenant, who should control and conduct the Board's establishments and administration, subject to the orders of the Board; of appointing an Estates Commissioner, taken in rotation, as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Board on a vacancy occurring among the appointed members, who were to be reduced to seven; and of limiting the term of office of appointed members other than the paid member to four years, with eligibility for reappointment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01311">He asked their Lordships' pardon for bringing the matter again under the notice of the House, but he was deeply impressed with the importance of having a paid member on the Congested Districts Board. It was one of the unanimous recommendations of the Dudley Commission that paid members, two or three, at all events two, were absolutely essential if the work of the Congested Districts Board was to be properly conducted. He had been a member and vice-chairman of the Congested Districts Board for nearly six years, and almost every day a large quantity of work, which could not be held over from one sitting of the Board to the other, was brought before him, and he had to pass orders on it, and trust to getting the sanction of the Board at a subsequent meeting. It was absolutely essential if the work was to be properly done that there should be a paid member. The establishments were large and the work considerable, and unless there was an authoritative head of the office matters would fall into arrear. That was his reason for proposing the first paragraph of his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01312">The Congested Districts Board at present consisted of eleven members, and he proposed that it should consist of twelve, in order to give the Lord Lieutenant the opportunity of appointing if necessary from outside the most competent person he could find. He was willing, if their Lordships so desired, to restrict the first clause by omitting the words "From and after the appointed day the Congested Districts Board shall consist of twelve members of whom," and so restrict the Board to the eleven members of which it consisted at present; but he thought it would be better if an opportunity were given to the Lord Lieutenant not necessarily to take his man from the existing Board. If their Lordships
<col>334</col>
desired to restrict the number of members to eleven, he was willing to cut out those words, and he thought that among the members of the Board the Lord Lieutenant would find an extremely competent person for the work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01313">The next portion of his Amendment was to introduce on the Board on the next vacancy a member of the Estates Commissioners. Formerly a member of the Estates Commissioners was on the Board and his presence was useful; but now that the Estates Commissioners would have to do all the purchasing work for the Board, it was very desirable that they should be acquainted with what passed at the Board, and generally be informed as to the motives and intentions of the Board. The object of the last paragraph of his Amendment was to effect an extension of the existing rule as to the length of tenure of office. Some of the Board held their office for life and some for four years, and he thought in the advantage of the public service that there should be a limitation of the period for which a member of the Board holds office. He would make him eligible for re-appointment, but he thought four years a sufficient time for any member of the Board continuing to occupy his seat. He would prefer that his Amendment should be accepted in its present form changing the word "shall" in the second paragraph into "may" if necessary; and if their Lordships should wish to change the membership to eleven, he was also quite willing, as he had said, to modify his Amendment in that respect in accordance with their wishes.</p>

had stated to their Lordships the present position, and exactly what he regarded as the future position. The noble Lord was so full of the subject that he assumed every one else was seized of an equal amount of knowledge, which was an entire mistake. It would be convenient to their Lordships if the noble Lord would state exactly the present condition as to numbers, the difference between appointed members and <i>ex officio</i> members, and exactly how the change would work out if the Amendment was adopted. He was afraid that very few in their Lordships' House could claim anything like the same amount of knowledge on the subject as the noble Lord possessed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01318"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> pointed out that on one of the occasions on which he had had the honour of addressing their Lordships' House he did explain what the position was. It was that the Congested Districts Board at present consisted of three <i>ex officio</i> members&#x2014;the Chief Secretary, the Under-Secretary, and the Vice-President of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. It also consisted of eight nominated members, forming a total of eleven. His proposal was that a twelfth should be appointed, and that the Lord Lieutenant should have the option of choosing any member of the Board to appoint to the paid post.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01319"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> asked whether that meant any member of the existing Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01320"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the paid member might either be appointed from outside or from the existing members, not being an <i>ex officio</i> member. He had put the number at twelve in order to give the Lord Lieutenant a wider field of selection for an appointment to a post which would be one of extreme importance. If he was limited to the existing appointed members of the Board, the election must necessarily fall on one gentleman, who would do doubt be an efficient member of the Board. When in another place the Chief Secretary stated his intention of appointing two paid members to the Board he mentioned the name of Mr. Micks and Mr. Doran. Mr. Micks happened to be a member of the Board at present, and consequently, if the Lord Lieutenant had to choose from the existing members of the Board, he naturally would
<col>336</col>
choose Mr. Micks. They could not get a better man; nor could they get a man more fitted for the post than Mr. Doran. If they kept the number at eleven, the choice must necessarily fall on Mr. Micks, whereas if they raised the number to twelve, the Lord Lieutenant would have a choice between the two. Those were his reasons for proposing the increase of the number to twelve.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01322"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that was so; he had provided for the paid member holding his office at pleasure. Under the Government Bill he could not be removed without the consent of both Houses of Parliament. The high officers of the Civil Service in Ireland held their office at pleasure, and as this appointment was not of a higher status he was not disposed to give to the gentleman who might be appointed a higher tenure of office than was enjoyed by the heads of those great Departments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01323"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said he did not quite know what to say with regard to the Amendment of the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, in respect to the composition of the Board. He agreed that it was really necessary that they should have a paid member of the Board, but whether it was necessary to increase the number of members to twelve in order to have a paid member was a matter upon which he did not know how to advise their Lordships. It seemed to him that they might find a paid member out of the eleven existing members of the Board. But what really puzzled him more than anything else was the latter part of the Amendment. Did the noble Lord mean to say that the moment there was a vacancy upon the Board, the number of appointed members should be at once <i>ipso facto</i> reduced to seven? How did he propose to effect that reduction? He thought the Amendment was not very acceptable as it stood.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01324"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that when the first appointed member of the Board retired at the end of the four years service for which an appointed member served, he not being a life member, there would be one vacancy. He proposed
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0175"/>
<col>337</col>
that that one vacancy should be filled up by the appointment of an Estates Commissioner, and then the constitution of the Board would be four <i>ex officio</i> members, seven appointed members, and one paid member, twelve in all. His object in framing the Amendment in the way he had done was to avoid increasing the total number of the Board beyond twelve, and at the same time to obtain the advantage of the services of an Estates Commissioner. But, as he had already said, their Lordships could do what he wanted done by keeping the number at eleven and appointing one of the existing members as a paid member.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01326"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said he would like to draw their Lordships' attention to the fact that Clause 39, at the beginning of Part III, provided that, "From and after the appointed day the Congested Districts Board for Ireland shall be a body corporate bearing the name of the 'Congested Districts Board for Ireland,' with a capacity to acquire and hold land and to sue and be sued by its corporate name." That was what was in the Bill after it had gone through its various stages, and now, at the eleventh hour, Lord MacDonnell came forward and created a new Congested Districts Board altogether. In the first place the number of members on the Board at present was eleven and the noble Lord wanted to make it into twelve, and among those twelve members he desired to appoint a gentleman at a very large salary. Their Lordships had heard of that before, and he did not know which gentleman the noble Lord favoured, whether Mr. Micks or Mr. Doran. That was not a matter to be discussed there; but; at the end of his Amendment the noble Lord made the extraordinary suggestion that one of the Estates Commissioners should become a member of the Congested Districts Board. He did not think that the Estates Commissioners had any wish to add to their already numerous duties in the way suggested, and he could not imagine anything more unlikely to further the efficiency of the Congested Districts Board than having one of the Estates Commissioners upon it. They had gone into the question of the Congested Districts Hoard in the various discussions of the Bill most fully, and now their Lordships were asked to construct
<col>338</col>
quite a new Congested Districts Board with a paid member and an Estates Commissioner, if they pleased, added on. He could well have understood the noble Lord bringing forward such a scheme in Committee, but their Lordships were on the Third Reading, and they were asked to recast the whole of this part of the Bill, because, forsooth, an Estates Commissioner was to be put on the Congested Districts Board and a gentleman in Ireland was to receive a very large salary. That was really what it amounted to, and he hoped their Lordships would not accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01327"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think, in spite of the rather trenchant criticism of the noble Earl who has just sat down, that nobody will be disposed to quarrel with my noble friend behind me for having brought this subject up again, because it is one of the very first importance in relation to the structure of the Bill. I have very little to say on the Amendment of the noble Lord. The House knows that the Dudley Commission suggested that three paid members should be placed on the Board. In our Bill we proposed that there should be two paid members, and we adhere to the belief that the work will not be properly done unless two paid members are appointed. It is, of course, difficult to argue the matter at this stage, because the general character and functions of the Board have been so altered from what they were in the Bill as we first introduced it that it becomes difficult to say how the Amendment would apply to the Board as it stands. It must be remembered that the functions of the Board have been greatly reduced, and as your Lordships have made it an infinitely less important body than it was a week or two ago, how far my noble friend's Amendment is applicable to the changed state of things and to those truncated powers may be a matter for further argument. We have desired to see the Board more powerful, with a wider scope, and with two paid members, but even as it stands, I should myself be disposed to think that my noble friend's Amendment represents an improvement on the existing state of things.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01328"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: When this subject was before us in Committee I think the general feeding was that we were very loath to consent to the abolition of the Congested Districts Board, a body which has earned for itself a great deal
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0176"/>
<col>339</col>
of respect and a great deal of gratitude in many parts of Ireland. For the same reason we disliked the idea of replacing it by some new body which would be really wholly dissimilar from the Congested Districts Board as we have been accustomed to know it. Therefore the general feeling was in favour of leaving the Congested Districts Board, so far as its constitution is concerned, very much alone. The noble Lord on the Back Benches has made a proposal which if it had come before the House at an earlier stage I should certainly have thought was well worth being examined in detail. I say in detail because it is a composite proposal; it contains several distinct propositions, some of which might be easily accepted without the others being accepted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01329"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Might I interrupt the noble Marquess for a moment? The fact that my noble friend did not bring this matter forward before may be accounted for, I think, in the following way. On the Report stage, there was an Amendment down in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Leitrim, somewhat to the same effect so far as regards a paid member. That Amendment was not moved; my noble friend may have been under the impression that a discussion would arise upon it, and therefore he did not put down an Amendment himself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01330"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am not suggesting for a moment that the noble Lord on the Back Bench is not fully entitled to bring the matter forward at this stage. His Amendment, as I was saying, is one which embodies several distinct propositions. He desires that there should be a paid member added to the Congested Districts Board. I am bound to say that personally I see no objection whatever to that proposal. The noble Earl is quite correct in saying that during the Report stage an Amendment to this effect stood in the name of my noble friend Lord Leitrim, and that it was not moved. The second proposal of the noble Lord is that one of the Estates Commissioners should sit upon the Board. That, I confess, seems to me to be a much more doubtful proposal. I have no doubt that the object of it is to bring the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners into closer touch. Considering the relations in which these two bodies are to be placed under the Bill as it now stands, that is no doubt a very desirable thing; but I am not convinced that in order that the two bodies may be in
<col>340</col>
close touch it is necessary that one Estates Commissioner should have a seat upon the Congested Districts Board. Then the noble Lord on the Back Bench asks us to make a very important change in the constitution of the Board. There are at present, as I understand it, three <i>ex officio</i> members and eight nominated members. The noble Lord wishes that there should in future be four <i>ex officio</i> members, seven nominated members and one paid member. I do not myself attach very great importance to the mere alteration of the number from eleven to twelve. But the question of the tenure of the members of the Board is certainly a serious one. The noble Lord did not, in his very instructive statement, make quite clear to the House what the tenure of the appointed members of the present Congested Districts Board is. I understand that some of them are appointed for life and some for four years. The noble Lord desires that all the appointed members should hold on a four years tenure. That, again, seems to me to be a not unreasonable idea. But all these things were a little difficult to gather from the wording of the Amendment, probably for the reason that my noble friend Lord Ashbourne suggested, that we are not all of us quite so familiar with these questions as the noble Lord. Therefore my feeling with regard to this Amendment is that there are some features in it which commend themselves very much to my judgment, but, on the other hand, I am bound to say that there would, in my opinion, be very great difficulty in introducing upon the Third Reading of the Bill so complete a change as that which has been suggested by the noble Lord. Therefore, not without considerable regret, I am afraid I must tell him that I can scarcely advise him to press the Amendment upon the House. If the suggestion for the appointment of the paid member had been before us at an earlier stage, and if the change in the tenure of the appointed members had been before us also, I should certainly have been inclined to support both of those proposals.</membercontribution></p>

He said his Amendment was, as it seemed to him, really more one of drafting than of substance. It was a question as to the way in which the Congested Districts Board should deal with voluntary purchases. The scheme as originally drafted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, included negotiations with the Congested Districts Board under Clause 50, but later on he amended Clause 46, subsection (3), so as to make voluntary transactions take place under that section of the Bill. If that were so there would be tautology in the second proposal, and, in addition, there would be the objection that while Clause 46 handed over to the Estates Commissioners all purchase transactions, Clause 50, in the part which he proposed to cut out, would give to the Congested Districts Board the function also of negotiating land purchase. There would be a conflict on those points which he thought it desirable to avoid in the way he suggested.</p>

In his view it was not for the Congested Districts Board to anticipate the decision which the Estates Commissioners might conic to, or in any way to interfere with their procedure in purchasing land whether by voluntary or compulsory acquisition. As he read the Bill as it now stood, the Congested Districts Board applied to the Estates Commissioners to purchase a particular estate or parcel of land from them, and whether the Estates Commissioners proceeded in the first instance by voluntary purchase, as of course they would, or whether they proceeded by the compulsory method provided for in Part IV of the Bill, was a matter for the Estates Commissioners and not for the Congested Districts Board.

The Congested Districts Board prepared a scheme and sent it to the Land Commission, and the scheme must be accompanied by a statement under the hand of the secretary setting forth the reasons why the Congested Districts Board wanted compulsory powers. That was part and parcel of the compulsory machinery, and had nothing to do with the acquisition of land by voluntary agreement. The Estates Commissioners then came to a conclusion as to whether or not it was necessary to apply the compulsory powers. In his opinion it was essential that these words should be retained.</p>

The noble Lord moved to leave out the words "the said scheme and." He said that inasmuch as the whole of the land purchase work had been handed over to the Estates Commissioners, the question of considering whether the scheme submitted was a proper scheme having regard to the necessity of acquiring the land was no longer a matter for the Estates Commissioners. They should receive the scheme and act in a ministerial capacity in carrying out the scheme, acquiring the land, issuing the notifications, ascertaining what the price to be paid for the land should be, and calling upon people to make their objections. When the objections were lodged in the Estates Commissioners' office, then the functions of the tribunal arose. All those objections would be handed over to the tribunal, and the tribunal would decide upon them; but if these words remained in this part of the Bill they would in the first instance have the Estates Commissioners considering the proposals of the Congested Districts Board, and considering whether or not the proposals were suitable for the purpose they had in view, and generally passing judgment upon the proposals of the Congested Districts Board. He would deprecate the Estates Commissioners taking up that position. In a former phase of the scheme it was right that they should do so, but now, as the tribunal had been established, it was their duty to consider whether or not the scheme was a proper one having regard to the interests of the parties. Whether or not the scheme was a proper one for the relief of congestion was a matter for the Congested Districts Board to consider. The Estates Commissioners were not in a position to form an opinion as to the suitability of the scheme for the purposes of receiving congestion. Their functions were to buy the land, and if any objections were made to their buying it they had to suspend their operations until the objections had been decided upon by the tribunal which had` been established. When the tribunal passed its orders either for or against the objections, a new state of things arose. If the tribunal said that the
<col>346</col>
objections were to prevail, then the whole thing would fall to the ground. If they overruled the objections, then the activity of the Estates Commissioners began again, and they would proceed to acquire the land. Then objections to price might be made, and in that case the Court which had to fix the price came into operation. The words he proposed to cut out seemed to him to give to the Estates Commissioners the discretion of passing a judgment upon the scheme as submitted to them, and that, he thought, was not desirable in the circumstances.</p>

He said his reason for substituting the County Court Judge was that it was very desirable that local knowledge should be possessed in such cases and the County Court Judge had that knowledge. Moreover, in the intervals of the Sessions Courts the County Court Judges in Ireland had a good deal of leisure and that could be very usefully turned to account in these adjudications. The County Court Judges were all men of standing, of great impartiality, and with very great local knowledge, while the Land Judge was restricted to Dublin and to a different class of case from those that would come before him under the Bill. The only advantage he could see in keeping

the Land Judge in was that he was always in Dublin, and it was desirable that he tribunal should be in a place where all the members could easily assemble; but, as he had said, County Court Judges had very considerable leisure and he thought it could be turned to account without disadvantage to suitors or litigants in the matter. His principal object was to secure for the tribunal some local knowledge; and inasmuch as their Lordships' House was not satisfied with a tribunal consisting of the Judicial Commissioner, a Judge of the High Court, and one of the Estates Commissioners, he thought the proposal which he now made was perhaps the best substitute which could be suggested.</p>

He could not agree at all with the noble Lord that a County Court Judge would be a good substitute for the Land Judge. Everybody in Ireland had complete confidence in the High Court Judges, but he thought that perhaps the least said about some of the County Court Judges in Ireland the better. He would rather not say anything about that; but he thought it was very desirable that they should have High Court Judges to decide the very important questions which would come under their jurisdiction in a clause of this kind. If there was any difficulty about the Land Judge, he thought it might be got over by putting in a second Judge of the King's Bench Division of the High Court. He was of opinion, however, that noble Lords on his side of the House would strongly object to putting in a County Court Judge in place of a Judge of the High Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01367"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he would be very sorry if in discussing the Amendment anything was suggested reflecting on the County Court Judges of Ireland, who were an excellent body of gentlemen entitled to every regard and respect. As he gathered from his noble friend opposite, Lord MacDonnell's point about the Land Judge was that he did not think that the particular selection of the Land Judge&#x2014;without any disparagement to Mr. Justice Ross&#x2014;was one that on the whole would lead to permanent
<col>348</col>
satisfaction. It was open to the remark that by a resolution of the House of Commons passed a few years ago it was agreed that there should not be a successor to Mr. Justice Ross. He did not know the exact position, but he believed that that was so, and if there should cease in the fulness of time to be a Land Judge, there would be fresh legislation needed. That was a matter which showed that the question of the constitution of the tribunal was one that required care. Lord Dunboyne who had studied the question a good deal, did not seem to be permanently wedded to the idea of a Land Judge, and he suggested that another Judge of the High Court should be introduced, but he did not say whether he was to be a <i>rota</i> Judge or how the idea was to be worked out.</p>

If he was in order in doing so, and he thought he was, he would be quite prepared, as there seemed to be an opinion on his side of the House that the Land Judge should be struck out, to move an Amendment to the Amendment to substitute for the Land Judge two Judges of the High Court. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, had expressed a very high opinion of the County Court Judges. That was an opinion which a Royal Commission that sat under Sir Edward Fry did not hold. On page 9 of their Report they said&#x2014;
<quote>"With reference to the action of County Court Judges on questions of value in rent cases, some of the Judges endeavour to form an independent opinion as to the sum proper to be fixed, but the majority of them feel themselves incapable of doing so, and in the absence of evident mistake do nothing but adopt and register the finding of their value."</quote>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01375"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>, in moving the insertion of a new clause after Clause 52, said that his Amendment followed the precedent of the Act of 1903, by which it was possible to compensate an agent for the loss of his business or for other reasons if the landlord desired it out of the purchase money. It was their desire to have such a power in a case of compulsory sale, just as they had it and exercised it in the case of a voluntary sale. A land agent in Ireland, as their Lordships were well aware, was in a very different position as a rule from that of an agent in other parts of the United Kingdom. He had to be, under their terribly complicated land system, a very skilled man with great technical knowledge, and the operation of the Purchase Acts, of course, resulted in his losing a profession to become a member of which he had gone through a very special training, and one which, as far as he knew, did not assist him in qualifying for any other occupation. He had before him a dozen precedents for what he was asking, and he hoped the Government would be able to favourably regard the matter. He did not pretend that he thought they would, because the agents were essentially landlords' men and the attitude of His Majesty's Government in the case of the Evicted Tenants Bill showed that at any rate they were not very strongly prejudiced in favour of the friends of landlords. These men had been their friends and staunch supporters through thick and thin for a great many years, and he did feel that they should at any rate take an enabling power to com-
<col>350</col>
pensate them after very often many years of faithful service. He earnestly appealed to their Lordships to keep the Bill in harmony with the Act of 1903, which gave the power of compensating those people to whom they were under such considerable obligations.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01379"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said that, in practice, it was in consideration of loss of business.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01380"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: When an estate is compulsorily bought the sale is not negotiated by the agent, and <i>ex hypothesi</i> it is quite possible that he may have done his best to prevent it. It seems to me, therefore, that the analogy of the Act of 1903 really breaks down there. The arguments which the noble Earl has used, I confess, do not convince me that in a case of this kind the agent has a special claim. Supposing the property to be bought is held in fee simple the vendor can give the agent as much as he pleases out of the purchase money. The effect of the Amendment is, of course, that where the estate is not held in fee simple but under a settlement where the remainder would naturally go to the remainder man, part of it would go to the agent. It would also, I suppose, be used as an argument for increasing the price of the land by saying, "If the land is worth so much to the landlord he ought to get
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0182"/>
<col>351</col>
it, and the agent ought to be paid a separate sum." I do not say the argument would be a very good one, but it might certainly be used in asking for a higher price, and for those reasons we are not disposed to accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01381"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I cannot help thinking that the noble Earl is incorrect when he thinks that the task of the agent in the case of a sale under compulsion would be a much lighter one than in the case of a voluntary sale. The agent throughout the difficult negotiations which inevitably would precede any compulsory sale would watch his principal's interest, and he might have extremely difficult and responsible work to do. But the real fact is that under my noble friend's clause this payment cannot be made without both the consent of the vendor and the consent of the Land Commission being obtained. Surely with these reservations there can be no great risk of an improper payment being made to the agent, or one in excess of the value of the services which he has rendered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01382"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> did not know whether the noble Earl had considered the proposition from the point of view of the workings of human nature. In a compulsory sale it was obvious that there must be some intermediary to do a great many things and to interchange a great many topics, and the man who could do that best would be the agent managing the property, who knew all about it and who could point out its advantages and smooth the way in a difficult and not always agreeable transaction. He questioned whether people who desired to make a compulsory sale were wise to exclude the assistance, and, it might be, the reasonable co-operation, of one who knew more about the business than anybody else.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01383"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> was of opinion that the Land Commission would be gainers by the new clause, because there was a provision that the agent should give the Land Commission all information, so that he really might be considered a paid servant of the Land Commission in giving them information about the property which probably nobody else would be in a position to give.</p>

It would be competent, for example, to any owner of grazing land after the Bill was passed to let the whole of his land to anybody, perhaps a relative of his own, at a nominal rent provided he was a <i>bona fide</i> tenant, and that was not intended. If his noble friend saw no objection, he would propose as an Amendment to the Amendment the following, "land not deemed untenanted under the provisions of this Act, held by a tenant under a <i>bona fide</i> contract of tenancy entered into before the first day of October, 1909, and by him used or cultivated as a farm, or part of a farm, according to a reasonable course of husbandry." He presumed his noble friend intended that the land of a <i>bona fide</i> tenant, a person who was now a tenant and who had cultivated it, should not be taken, but he also presumed that he did not intend that a person who might be created a tenant after the passing of the Act should be exempt. If that was so, the whole system of the compulsory acquisition of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0183"/>

land would be rendered absolutely nugatory.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01391"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> said it appeared to him that his noble friend's Amendment to his Amendment would have the effect of preventing anybody in future from letting any untenanted land. He much preferred his own Amendment as it stood.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01392"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSPOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Before the question is put, perhaps we lay members of the House might ask for a little more information as to the effect of these different formulas. What I take it we desire is that a <i>bona fide</i> sitting tenant should enjoy immunity from the application of compulsion. The precise way of arriving at that result is a thing which I would not undertake to suggest to the House, but it does seem to me a simple proposition, and that it would not be beyond our powers to find simple words in which to express it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01393"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he would undertake to find the words if he had the idea. He did not know whether the noble Marquess meant that a <i>bona fide</i> tenant who was hereafter created should be exempt or whether he meant that a person must be a <i>bona fide</i> tenant at the passing of the Act, or at some other date.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01394"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It is only by the indulgence of the House that I can answer my noble friend's question.

<col>355</col>
from engaging in attempts to buy compulsorily at all. And for this reason, that, as a rule, I take it, if a man had, say, a really large farm of &#x00A3;400 valuation, and there was a question of taking half of it, it is possible that he would greatly prefer to have the whole taken. Looking at it from those two distinct points of view, I fear that the operations of the Commissioners as regards this particular sort of land would be greatly limited by the noble Earl's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

He quite saw the point of view taken by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, that the man might prefer the whole of it to be taken; and they might put in a proviso to the effect that if a vendor required it, the Estates Commissioners who wished to take a part of his farm should take the whole, just as was done with land taken under the Lands Clauses Act. It was very hard if a man's farm was rated at &#x00A3;201 a year he could have the whole of it taken away from him as untenanted land, whereas if it was rated at &#x00A3;200, he would not have an acre taken from him. He was sure Lord Clanwilliam would be very glad to have a proviso of that sort inserted, that if a vendor desired to sell the whole of his farm when the Estates Commissioners designed only to take a part, he should be at liberty to do so.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01417"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved a new clause for the purpose of relieving the Congested Districts Board from the necessity of stating in the notice served upon a tenant that the new holding with which the Board undertook to provide him should be situated in the same or an adjacent or neighbouring estate. He said that the noble Earl the Leader of the House stated, when this matter was before their Lordships on Report that he could not accept the Amendment in its then form. He (Lord MacDonnell) had endeavoured to alter the Amendment and he hoped it would be more acceptable to His Majesty's Government in its present form. The meaning was this. When the Congested Districts Board bought an estate and found that in order to improve the condition of the tenants on the estate it was necessary to migrate some of them, they issued a notice in which they gave a promise that they would provide the tenant whom they removed, and whom their Lordships now authorised them to remove without his consent, with a holding of similar value on the same or on some adjacent or neighbouring estate. As they had now enabled the Congested Districts
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0185"/>
<col>357</col>
Board to acquire land in certain circumstances compulsorily and at a distance, it would be impossible, if these words were retained, to carry out migration on any large scale. It would be impossible to always find, on the same or on an adjacent or neighbouring estate, land which the tenant who was to be removed could obtain. It might be necessary for the Congested Districts Board to remove tenants to a distance of eight or ten miles or more, and unless that power was given to the Board nothing like migration on a large scale would be possible. He thought his new clause was a necessary consequence of the clause their Lordships had already adopted in approving of the compulsory acquisition of land in certain circumstances. Hitherto, the Congested Districts Board had been compelled to buy estates where they could find them close to the holdings which they wanted to improve. Of course, the owners of those estates had a monopoly. The Board could not remove people to a distance, and consequently the Board was always compelled to buy estates at a high price; but now, as compulsory power had been given, it would be no longer necessary to acquire land in the neighbourhood of the estates to be improved. If land could be found in the neighbourhood, of course, it was better that it should be bought; but it was not always possible to find land in the place where it was wanted. He submitted that unless their Lordships accepted this new clause or something like it migration on a large scale would be impossible.</p>

He said he had put the Amendment down in the hope of getting some satisfaction from His Majesty's Government, and he was glad to see that the noble Earl the Leader of the House intended to move an Amendment on the subject, which, at any rate, was half a loaf.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01429"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I move to add the following words to the end of subsection (3) of the First Schedule, "regard being had in the case of untenanted land to the fair annual value of the land to the owner."

I may say with regard to this Amendment that it carries out what I stated was the intention of the Treasury in dealing with this matter, and I think noble Lords will see that so far as untenanted land is concerned it does give a complete safeguard to a vendor so far as regards this particular question of a graduated bonus. If there is a question of selling untenanted land, as regards the lump sum to be obtained for it there may be a question of how many years purchase that lump sum ought to represent, owing to various causes, but whatever calculation was made it could only have the effect of
<col>360</col>
reducing the number of years. It could not have the effect of reducing the sum. As the bonus is in inverse ratio to the number of years, the result, I think, apparently will be, that where a considerable rent is now obtained for untenanted land, even though the whole purchase money might not represent what noble Lords would consider an adequate sum, yet the bonus is bound to be a good one, because the bonus increases in proportion as the number of years are reduced.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01434"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to move that this Bill do pass, I desire because I think it is my duty to do so, to make one or two&#x2014;they shall be very few&#x2014;observations on its general position. So far as the financial provisions of the measure are concerned, the Amendments carried by your Lordships' House have not been very extensive. That, I think, is due to two reasons. The first is that it is a long standing custom of your Lordships' House not to amend extensively financial provisions of this kind, or indeed of any kind; and the second reason, a not less good one, is that the financial provisions&#x2014;whatever exception may be taken to them, here and there, by noble Lords opposite&#x2014;provide a very large further sum for the necessities of Irish land purchase. But in other respects the Amendments which the House has seen fit to carry are of a very far-reaching character indeed.<lb/>
So far as land purchase is concerned, the provisions which, while desiring fully to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0187"/>
<col>361</col>
safeguard the existence of the zones, the usefulness of which we admit, we introduced in order to prevent evasion of the Act of 1903, evasion which has arisen in some cases and may arise in more with regard to purchase within the zones, thus adversely affecting the security of the nation for these purchases&#x2014;these provisions have been struck out of the Bill by your Lordships. Then the limitation which we proposed on advances for purchase has been very rudely dealt with by your Lordships. Not only have you altered our figure from &#x00A3;3,000 to &#x00A3;5,000, but under one head you have done what the Act of 1903 never did&#x2014;namely, to permit an absolutely unlimited amount to be advanced by the Estates Commissioners for the purchase of farms. Then your Lordships have also altered the provisions which were inserted for the exclusion of new tenancies made after January, 1908&#x2014;tenancies, indeed, some of which may have been created for the very purpose of defeating the provisions of our Bill.<lb/>
Then as regards the congested districts, your Lordships have turned our proposals altogether inside out. We proposed to give a large extra sum for the purposes of the Congested Districts Board, and that sum will still remain payable under the Bill as amended. But it must not be forgotten that the advance of that sum coheres in our Bill with the other changes which we proposed to make with regard to the Board. The noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Atkinson, when I pointed out on a previous occasion that this might be so, said, I think, that it was the first time he had heard that a further increase in income was the price of the extinction of the Board. Surely, my Lords, it is not altogether an unknown thing, when you increase and widen the functions of a public body and entrust it with largely increased sums for the purpose of exercising those functions, that its composition should, in some degree, be altered. That is what we proposed to do. We proposed to alter the composition of the Board. In respect to that alteration of the composition of the Board, I ought to say that we proposed to increase its area, and while taking away some of its functions and handing them over to a body particularly well fitted to exercise them&#x2014;the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;we increased its powers in other respects. Well, all that has been altered by your Lordships.<lb/>
It is true that after a serious amount of
<col>362</col>
discussion and strong opposition from many noble Lords from Ireland, the principle of compulsion has just been admitted into the Bill&#x2014;just barely admitted in as limited a district as possible, and under the closest restrictions which the ingenuity of the legal minds of noble and learned Lords could most laboriously devise. I still think that in the interests of noble Lords and other Irish landlords, as well as in the general interest of the community, the House would have been well advised if it accepted the principle of compulsion at all, to admit its application all over Ireland. The distinction as regards its particular operation between the congested districts and the rest of Ireland seems to me to be needlessly invidious, and undesirable, therefore, from the landowners' point of view no less than from that of the public. Now when purchases in this form, if they can ever take place at all, are limited to untenanted land absolutely and to the congested districts, the provision, I am afraid, will not be of very real service.<lb/>
Looking back on all the changes you have made in the Bill, I cannot help feeling that the difference between our measure and your Lordships' measure is this. We did not hope that any measure applying to land in Ireland, after the varied experiences of the last forty years, could be regarded as an absolutely final measure, but we did hope that in this Bill we had made provision for an order of things which would last without serious change or amendment for a considerable time to come. We hoped, at any rate, that we had laid down general rules which would see land purchase through. As your Lordships have amended the Bill, this most distinctly is not the case. As the Bill has been restricted by these Amendments, even though you may consider all the restrictions necessary, you cannot deny that it leaves room for cases of individual complaint at almost every point, whether it be on the zones, whether it be with regard to particular land which it may be desirable to purchase compulsorily and which cannot be acquired owing to the numerous safeguards, whether it be the cases such as those which the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, refused to admit existed&#x2014;cases where a landlord refused to sell though his tenants might desire to buy, quite apart from any question of the relief of congestion&#x2014;cases which, as we are given to understand, exist in that part of Ireland which the noble Lord knows best, and in respect of which the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0188"/>
<col>363</col>
provisions for compulsory purchase have had the support of the Ulster Members of Parliament as a whole. All through, as I venture to think, the extreme care which your Lordships have taken to safeguard all these different provisions for the acquirement of land and a great many other objects will bring up a crop of hard cases and complaints and demands for further legislation.<lb/>
If the Bill in its present state were to become law, I venture to predict that if not next year, then the year after, you would have, I do not say a violent, but an extensive and strong demand for some further amendment of the Irish land laws. We in this country are all of us sick of attempting to amend the Irish land laws, and we look forward with dismay to the prospect of leaving almost every question, and sub-question, if I may use the phrase, open for further discussion and possibly further amendment in the way that your Lordships have done. Consequently I greatly regret that the Bill has taken the form it has, one so very different from that in which it came up to us. We said, and we felt, that there were points on which it was reasonable to expect that your Lordships, looking at the matter from an entirely different point of view from ours, necessarily, would desire to make Amendments, and to that desire, even though we might not always agree, we should not take exception; but it is a serious matter to find a Bill so utterly altered in outline and substance as it is by the Amendments which your Lordships' House has made.<lb/>
I am sure I shall not be misunderstood in what I am going to say. Is it not, my Lords, an unfortunate fact that a discussion of this kind, lasting for many days, should be exclusively carried on by noble Lords from Ireland? Would it not have been possible for some noble Lord, an Englishman, and therefore conceivably able to take a more impartial view than noble Lords opposite, to have got up the subject&#x2014;I admit a most complicated and even repulsive one&#x2014;and to have given your Lordships' House the benefit of an opinion of a somewhat different kind from that with which we have been favoured all through these debates? Noble Lords opposite expressed their opinions, some strongly, some gently, but they are all opinions from one single point of view. It is not too much to say that what we have had has not been the House of Lords, but a Grand Committee composed of noble
<col>364</col>
Lords who own land in Ireland or are interested in land-owning in Ireland. That being so, I make no complaint of the manner in which the views of noble Lords have been advanced, but I think when it comes to the question of the authority attaching to such sweeping Amendments as those that have been made, that authority must suffer greatly in the eyes of the public and, if you like to put it so, in the eyes of those in another place, from the fact of it being founded on and limited to one kind of opinion, and, I say it with no offence, in many cases interested opinion. I trust there is no offence in saying that, because we all must be personally interested in something, and it may happen from time to time that Bills come up affecting our particular interest. Apart from this particular measure, I cannot help thinking that I shall find concurrence among noble Lords opposite when I say that so far as the reputation of this House is concerned the more noble Lords who are not thus directly interested in a subject can come forward and take some part in its discussion, endeavour to understand it, and endeavour to give us the benefit of their advice upon it, the more will your Lordships be fulfilling the real functions of a Second Chamber, and the greater the authority which such changes that you may think fit to make in Bills will receive outside. I can only repeat once more my regret that the form of the Bill has been so largely altered, and, of course, I cannot pretend to say what view may be taken in another place of many of the Amendments which your Lordships have thought fit to make.</membercontribution></p>

wearisome to many people, owing to the number of sessions in which it has played a conspicuous part, and may I suggest to the noble Earl that it is only those unfortunate people who have been almost compelled in self-defence to follow the intricate course of all this Irish legislation, who are able to take a part in it.<lb/>
I stated the other evening, and I was not contradicted, that I had been informed that in the last twenty-five years something like twenty-five Irish Land Bills have been passed. Is it expected that noble Lords entirely unconnected with Ireland are to take the trouble to obtain even a superficial acquaintance with that great body of Irish legislation which we Irishmen are compelled, much to our regret, to acquire? But if when we have a military debate it is carried on mainly by noble Lords connected with the Army, or a Naval debate by noble Lords interested in Admiralty administration, why is not an Irish debate to be carried on by noble Lords specially interested in Ireland? I must say that that reproach does not greatly affect me. Although I detest the kind of argument which is usually described as a <i>tu quoque</i>, may I be allowed to call attention to the fact that I do not think the noble Earl who has very gallantly conducted this Bill through these debates received very much support from the English Peers on his side of the House? With the sole exception of my noble friend on the Back Bench, Lord MacDonnell, who spoke with a thorough knowledge of the subject which entitles all that he says to our utmost attention, I do not think the noble Earl was assisted by any of his usual supporters on the Back Benches; and it even went so far as this&#x2014;that, in a division which the noble Earl described as affecting a cardinal point in the Bill, he carried with him into the Lobby about fourteen or fifteen only of his supporters. Where, I ask, on that occasion were those numerous recruits who have lately joined the Army opposite? I will say no more upon that subject.<lb/>
The noble Earl admitted that, so far as the finance of the Bill was concerned, your Lordships have dealt respectfully with that part of the measure. I think I may certainly say that some of those who sit behind me felt a great reluctance to interfere with the delicate and complicated financial machinery of the Bill. Besides, we were animated by
<col>366</col>
the feeling that, after all, these proposals some of which were not received with rapturous gratitude by my noble friends, were the only means before us for preventing land purchase in Ireland, which we have always regarded as the one remedy for the evils of that country, from dying of inanition, and therefore we certainly did not desire to impede in any way the passage of that part of the Bill.<lb/>
Now just one word as to some of the points on which the noble Earl touched. He referred to our treatment of the question of the zones. Again and again on these Benches we expressed our readiness to support any well-considered proposal which the noble Earl and his advisers might bring before the House for the purpose of dealing with the question of evasion in connection with the application of the zones. The noble Earl told us again and again that the cases were extremely rare, and we challenged him to produce words calculated to deal with the particular sort of evasion of which he complained, but the only definite proposal which we were able to obtain from His Majesty's Government was a proposal which, beyond all question, would have thrown the zones into the melting-pot, and which would have given none of the parties the security and the protection which they now enjoy under the zone system. Then the noble Earl complained of the manner in which we had dealt with the size of the grants or advances which may be made to tenant purchasers. There we did differ from the noble Earl upon a question of principle. Throughout the proposals of the Government we detected, and I think we were right in detecting, a desire to bring all the holdings in Ireland to a dead level, which would not admit the existence of any of those larger holdings which add so much to the prosperity and to the stability of agricultural communities in whatever part of the world they may be found. We do not think, particularly now that the position of owners of land in Ireland has been so seriously impaired, that it would be a good thing for that country that there should be no large occupiers of land from one end of the country to the other.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl came to our treatment of those clauses which had reference to the congested districts. The noble Earl said that, in view of the large sum to be granted for the relief of congestion, it was only natural and logical that the 
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0190"/>
<col>367</col>
constitution of the Congested Districts Board should be fundamentally altered. I do not greatly differ from the noble Earl, and if it had been merely a question of some modification of the composition of the Board, such as, for example, that which was discussed this afternoon, the addition of a paid member or members or some reasonable change in the tenure of the members of the Board, I should have been very much inclined to accept his proposals. But what did we find in this Bill? We found a Board the constitution of which&#x2014;I assure the noble Earl I do not say it in any offensive spirit&#x2014;was the laughing stock of every one who had to undertake the criticism of this Bill. The handling of these enormous sums of money, the distribution of land amongst all the numerous applicants for it&#x2014;all this patronage was to be handed over to a body of which the majority were to be popularly elected, and which any one with the slightest knowledge of Irish affairs would be aware was on the face of it, the most improper body you could select for the purpose of dispensing a colossal patronage of that kind. I will not labour that point further, because that particular proposal was, if I may say so, completely and absolutely demolished by the remarkable document added to the Report of the Dudley Commission by my noble friend on the Back Bench, Lord MacDonnell.<lb/>
The noble Earl also took exception to the manner in which we had treated the allocation of the duties which are to be henceforth undertaken on the one hand by the Congested Districts Board and on the other by the Land Commission. I am unrepentant upon that point. I believe that the distribution of duties which will take effect under the Bill as it now stands is a much more logical distribution and one much more calculated to lead to an efficient discharge of the business which these important bodies will have to conduct. I will not again remind the House of the fact that the Congested Districts Board was, at first, in sole possession of the field, and that long after it had begun its useful labours we created the Department of Agriculture and Industries, which overlapped it at many points. We also passed the Land Purchase Act of 1903 which introduced brand-new machinery, and it was surely obvious that the time had come when a complete revision of the functions of these different authorities had
<col>368</col>
become absolutely necessary. Such a revision we have attempted and I believe that the Bill as it now stands is, upon that point at all events, a very reasonable and effective measure.<lb/>
The most serious count in the noble Earl's indictment was that we had, as he put it, barely admitted into the Bill the principle of compulsion. It is quite true that compulsion as it now finds a place in the Bill is a very different thing from the kind of compulsion which was apparently contemplated by the framers of the measure. But do not let your Lordships forget that the noble Earl again and again in the course of his speeches insisted upon the fact that in his view the power of compulsion was to be very rarely exercised and only in the most exceptional cases. Well, we have brought into the Bill a form of compulsion which will, in our belief, cover those exceptional cases which the noble Earl desires to provide for. In our view it would have been a great injustice and entirely opposed to public policy to introduce broadcast over the whole of Ireland, whether in or out of the congested districts, this principle, which the noble Earl admires so much, of wholesale compulsion. May I say with regard to that question and to other so-called remedies which have been proposed by noble Lords opposite for the treatment of Ireland, that, in our view, these heroic remedies, these attempts at rapid transformation, are not so likely to conduce to the permanent welfare of the country as a much more deliberate and gradual amelioration of its condition.<lb/>
Only one word more with regard to the position in which your Lordships' House has found itself with regard to this Bill. I think we have a right to remind the noble Earl that we found ourselves asked to put into shape a measure containing a more extraordinary collection of ill-thought-out and imperfectly-discussed proposals than I believe ever came before this House of Parliament. It was a Bill apparently based upon an attempt to include any proposal, no matter how wild, that was pressed upon His Majesty's Government by the Nationalist Party. Those proposals were accepted, were hurriedly thrown together and included in a Bill, and passed up to this House for revision, after, in many cases, the merest form of discussion in the other House of Parliament. We did our best to deal with a position which was
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0191"/>
<col>369</col>
certainly not free from difficulty, and all I can say is that if the noble Earl believes that had we passed the Bill in the shape in which it came to us it would have been a final settlement of the land question in Ireland, he is very much mistaken. I believe, on the contrary, that it was a Bill replete with the germs of future difficulties, and that the Bill as it now stands is a better Bill for Irish purposes than the Bill as it came into this House. My Lords, I have ventured to complain somewhat of the noble Earl's criticism of the manner in which this important measure has been treated, but may I be permitted to say, before I resume my seat, that if I make that complaint I make no complaint whatever of the manner in which the noble Earl has himself conducted the Bill through this House. During these long discussions he has met us in a straightforward way and with the utmost courtesy, and it is with sincere regret that we on this side of the House find ourselves so widely differing from him upon the merits of the case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01444">[The EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01445">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01446">1. For the purposes of this Act the established officers and servants employed in asylums shall be divided into two classes. The first class shall consist of all those established officers and servants who have the care or charge of the patients in the usual course of their employment. The second class shall include all other established officers and servants.</p>
<col>370</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01447"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said the three Amendments on the Paper which stood in his name to this clause were part of a series of Amendments he had been asked to submit to their Lordships in the name of the London County Council. He desired, of course, solely to consult the convenience of their Lordships, but he thought it would be probably more convenient that he should explain the purport of the Amendments now. He was sorry to notice that these Amendments ran very much counter to a scheme which was mostly contained in the Amendments of Lord Belper, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh being also interested in the same point. He was glad to think that there were one or two Amendments of his noble friends later on which he would be able to support on behalf of the London County Council, but he was afraid on this particular point there was a considerable gulf between them, arising from the peculiar situation of the London County Council in this matter owing to the extensiveness of the duties they had to perform. They had, as their Lordships were probably aware, ten asylums under their charge, which was a very much larger number, he fancied, than was the case with most, if not all, of the local authorities in the Kingdom. He was told that they were contemplating the addition of another asylum, and they supervised no fewer than 17,900 patients. As the result of such a very large system, they had, of course, a proportionately large staff, all of whom gave their whole time to this particular work. This Bill, if passed in its present form, would cut out from its benefits a very large number of officers in the asylum service. It would not only cut out future holders of these offices, but it was actually going to deprive of a pension a large number of officers who had now a perfectly definite expectation of one. It was owing to this fact that the London County Council supported the Bill as it was originally introduced in another place; he held in his hand a copy of a resolution which showed the attitude of two committees of the London County Council upon this subject in the direction he had just mentioned, and he should be pleased to show the resolution to any of their Lordships who desired to see it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01448">The difference of principle between the Bill and the desires of the London County Council was that whereas the Bill extended its obvious advantages to a very large number of officers in the asylum service, it did not extend those advantages to all
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0192"/>
<col>371</col>
those officers, at any rate in the asylum service of the London County Council, and it was the desire of the London County Council that all those officers should share in its benefits. The theory on which the Bill seemed to proceed was that wherever there was danger from contact with lunatics the official should be given the advantages of this Bill, but that any official who was not actually submitted not only to danger but to constant danger should not be brought within the benefits of the Bill. That, of course, excluded the whole of the large clerical staff of the London County Council, or, at any rate, a very large part of it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01449">Perhaps he might be allowed to give some concrete cases which, he was advised, would not come within even the second class mentioned in Clause 2. First of all, however, he might say generally that all lunatics were, if he might use the phrase, potentially dangerous. One could never be certain when they were likely to prove dangerous, and in all asylums, he understood, there were selected lunatics working in the grounds and elsewhere who might at any time develop homicidal tendencies; and on two occasions recently, he was informed by officers of the London County Council, a lunatic working in the grounds of an asylum attacked another lunatic. In one case the attack was made with a pick-axe, the patient attacked being murdered. Obviously if there were danger to another lunatic there was equal danger to an officer of the Council coming in any way into contact with the lunatic, and it was the opinion, therefore, of the Council that that officer should not be denied the benefits of this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01450">He had a large number of cases of officials who, he believed, would be excluded under the Bill as it now stood. First, he might mention that at the epileptic colony, where all the patients were specially selected as fit to work in the grounds, a patient recently felled a medical superintendent with a piece of iron-piping which he had concealed under his coat, and in this case there was very little doubt that the action was premeditated. He might quote the well-known case of the late Mr. Ermson, a Commissioner in Lunacy, very well known in connection with the subject of asylums, who was visiting Bexley Asylum in his official capacity and
<col>372</col>
returned to a ward to re-count the patients. A lunatic stabbed him in the throat with a large sharpened nail, which he admitted he had cunningly concealed about his person for some days, his intention being to kill one of the committee of the asylum. He mentioned this case to show that it was not only the persons who were in direct charge of lunatics who might be in positions of danger from the result of their contact with lunatics.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01451">But he would now come actually to the officials of the London County Council. There was a clerk and a staff of clerical assistants who devoted the whole of their time to their administrative work. Their conditions were, he believed, quite different from those of officers having the care of lunatics under the jurisdiction at any rate of a great many other authorities. These officers frequently visited the asylums. Every week of the year there were several meetings in the various asylums, and thus the clerk and his assistants, in the course of their duties, were brought into contact with the patients. The clerk very often visited the wards on occasions of inquiry or statutory inspection, and therefore he ran exactly the same risks as members of the committee; he ran exactly the same risks as would be run in some of the cases he (Lord Donoughmore) had already quoted to their Lordships. Yet the clerk would be excluded from any of the benefits of the Bill&#x2014;at least, he was advised that that was so if the Bill passed in its present form. The London County Council had a special engineer told off to the asylums. He was known as the asylums engineer, and he frequently had to visit asylums about heating, lighting, and so on, and his duties, therefore, brought him into a position which afforded constant opportunity for attack upon him if any lunatic were so minded. Yet he was advised that that engineer would not enjoy the benefits of this Bill. There was also a pathologist, undoubtedly a member of the asylums' staff, his duties being entirely confined to circumstances arising in the asylums; he, of course, had constantly to go into the asylums and all over them, but he was excluded from the benefits of this Bill. Therefore, he (Lord Donoughmore) claimed that the particular position of the London County Council made it absolutely necessary, if fairness was to be meted out to all its officials, that this Bill should be extended in the way that his three 
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0193"/>
<col>373</col>
Amendments to this clause asked their Lordships to extend it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01452">He wished to urge another point upon their Lordships. A great many officials who now looked forward to benefits such as would be given under this Bill under the present system would lose those benefits as the result of the passing of this Bill, and they would be therefore very unfairly treated unless some such Amendments as he was now moving were passed. He knew it was a matter of dispute as to whether all the officials of the London County Council were at present justified in claiming that they had these benefits; but he would say that in 1904 the London County Council took counsel's opinion on the point, and he would read two short extracts from that opinion. The first was&#x2014;
<quote>"In our opinion all officers and servants appointed by the Asylums Committee, including the clerk of such Committee, are pensionable under the 280th Section of the Lunacy Act, 1890, and are exempt from liability to contribute to the Superannuation and Provident Fund of the Council. The fact that any such officer or servant is appointed in the central office, and not in connection with any particular asylum does not, in our opinion, prevent him from being so pensionable."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01453">The next extract was&#x2014;
<quote>"We do not think the engineer or his professional or clerical assistants can be compelled to contribute to the Council's scheme, and the same applies, in our opinion, to the pathologist and his professional and laboratory assistants. The reason is that all these officers and servants are in our opinion pensionable under Section 280 of the Lunacy Act, 1890."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01454">That was the opinion of no less an authority than the present Secretary of State for War, and he did not think it was unreasonable that he (Lord Donoughmore) should claim that the Government should accept it; and in view of this opinion it was a very far-reaching action that the present Bill should wipe out all the expectations which the officials in question now undoubtedly enjoyed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01456"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> said he had no quarrel with the way in which his noble friend stated his case. His noble friend had truly stated that the great principle of this
<col>374</col>
Bill was as to whether there was danger or whether there was no danger; but then he went on to say that there was danger in the case of doctors in the asylum service, who, he said, would be excluded from the Bill as it now stood. He (Lord Monk Bretton) said they were not excluded from the Bill as it now stood, and that was the quarrel between them. The noble Earl made a great case of the hardships to which existing servants would be exposed, but Clause 13 permitted those servants to contract out so that they were left if they chose as they were before. What was the noble Earl's, case in reference to the epileptic? The words of the Bill were "employed in asylums." How could a man be knocked down by an iron pipe in an asylum unless he was employed in an asylum? Then the noble Earl made a point as to the clerical staff of the County Council. That was a very broad question. He said on the Second Reading that the great principle of this Bill was the question of whether or not there was danger. They gave these people preferential treatment because there was danger. If a clerk of a committee of the London County Council went into the asylum and was in contact with lunatics he would come within the provisions of the Bill, but if he did not do so then he was not treated differently from the clerk of any other committee of the London County Council. This was not a matter which affected the London County Council only but England, Scotland and Ireland; and why should a country solicitor who acted as asylums committee clerk and perhaps did not go to the asylum at all, or else went there under circumstances where he ran not the slightest risk or nerve strain of any sort, be in a different position from the clerk of the finance committee of a county council? On these grounds he hoped the noble Earl would not press his Amendment. Of course, if the noble Earl differed from him on a question of law, there were higher authorities in the House to decide that point; but as this Bill referred to officers employed in asylums he did not see how a man could be in danger or receive injury in the asylum without coming within the scope of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01457"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> hoped their Lordships would not agree to this Amendment. Speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill he said that while he thought the county councils were as a rule in hearty sympathy with the general
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0194"/>
<col>375</col>
principles of the Bill, they were not prepared to admit that everyone who happened to be employed about the grounds of an asylum was a person entitled to a pension. There were many such persons whose occupations brought them very little into contact with the lunatics, and to say that persons who ran the same danger as those of their Lordships who had served on asylum committees were deserving of special consideration on account of the risks they ran was, he thought, absurd. He had served on a committee for a great many years, and it had never occurred to him that he was undergoing nerve strain or exposing himself to an enormous amount of danger such as would justify his having the same preferential consideration as other people in the asylums.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01458"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member> did not think the noble Earl's Amendment would have quite the effect the noble Earl thought. A large number of the people to whom the noble Earl referred were, he believed, already included in the Bill. To begin with, this Bill did not take away from those who were employed by the London County Council any right or any expectation they had at the present time. There was nothing in the Bill which could deprive them of any expectation they legally or morally enjoyed at the present time; but, on the other hand, he thought the Bill as it stood included a certain number of people whom the noble Lord below the Gangway did not appreciate were likely to come within the effects of the Bill. Some of their Lordships had probably had the same experience he had had himself of being on a visiting committee of a lunatic asylum. Certainly in country districts it was a very common thing for lunatic asylums to have a large farm, on which they had a large number of servants who were helped by lunatics. His own idea was that a dairyman in the employ of a lunatic asylum who was hurt by lunatics in the discharge of his duties, being generally assisted by lunatics, was a proper person to be superannuated under the scheme of this Bill. The idea of the noble Earl opposite, he thought, was that as the Bill stood it would not allow such a man to come under the scheme. There he joined issue with the noble Earl. He thought such a man came quite clearly under the definition of the Bill. On the other hand, certainly the members of a committee going round an asylum were not entitled to superannuation any more than the architect who went in to give an 
<col>376</col>
occasional opinion. They did not and ought not to come under the Bill; but under the Bill as it stood he thought it was perfectly plain that any servant who was in contact with lunatics would come under the scheme of superannuation and that was really the idea that was in the mind of their Lordships. They all wished that whatever the immediate employment of these persons might be, if they were in constant contact with lunatics they should be able to enjoy the advantages of this Bill. He thought the noble Earl was really under an unnecessary fear that these people would be excluded, and under the circumstances he should like to join in the appeal to him not to press this Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01459"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he would like to point out to the noble Earl who moved the Amendment that he appeared to propose to leave out the most important words in the Bill, "employed in asylums." Was the noble Earl going to leave out the title of the Bill? If he did not do so, it was not logical. With the words "employed in asylums" left out, the Bill might affect any one in a hospital or who had any dealing with any patient. There would be nothing to confine the Bill to asylums. If the noble Earl meant that, he ought to bring in a separate Bill for the London County Council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01460">What was the history of this Bill? The Bill was introduced in the other House by a gentleman who added to his other qualifications the honour of having been chairman of the London County Council. The whole case of the London County Council was fully placed before the Committee&#x2014;the only part of the proceedings in the other House to which they were able to refer in any way, because the other proceedings were silent. After the case of the London County Council was heard in the Select Committee and the Bill had been through the other House with general consent, that gentleman now wanted to upset the whole Bill and make it suited for the London County Council, and for the London County Council alone, quite forgetting that if he was going to impose these stringent regulations in respect of other officers it would greatly widen the Bill and lead to very much larger expense. He hoped that if the noble Earl would not withdraw the Amendment it would not at all events be allowed to be added to the Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01461"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said he was afraid he had not got the same innocent faith in a Committee of the other House that the noble Lord seemed to have. It was quite true that this Bill was introduced by an ex-chairman of the London County Council and as introduced the Council actively supported it. With regard to the proposed omission of the words "employed in asylums," he thought the noble Lord answered that point himself when he said that he (Lord Donoughmore) did not propose to alter the title. That made it quite clear that the Bill referred to people in the asylum service.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01463"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said the noble Lord would find the word "asylum" in a number of places in the Bill where he did not propose to move its omission, and he thought that would be enough to establish his case. Of course, he did not desire at the present stage to press this Amendment. The noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, had met him perfectly fairly and frankly. He understood from the noble Earl that it was the desire of the Government that any one who, owing to his profession, was in danger should receive the benefits of the Bill, and that being so he did not desire to press the Amendment now, although he was sure their Lordships would allow him to retain his right and to see whether any Amendment safeguarding the London County Council could be introduced at a later stage.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01469"><member>LORD BELPER</member> thought he had better continue his remarks, because he did not understand the noble Lord in charge of the Bill to say that he would accept the Amendment, although he hoped he would. What he desired by these Amendments was to confine the higher scale to those who had direct charge of the patients. He had always recognised that this Bill had received very warm support on many sides from the fact that the asylum service was not only very unpleasant in many respects, but it was also a dangerous service, and for that reason, although many of his friends would have liked to see the whole of the Bill made adoptive and not compulsory on every authority, he had not taken the course of moving any Amendment in that direction because he thought it would be an attack on the principle of the Bill. He recognised the principle of the Bill so far as the first clause went, but he wished to confine it to those who were in direct charge of the patients, and not to include the numerous class whom Lord Donoughmore referred to, and who would be only very occasionally in touch with the patients. Probably this was not the time to refer to further Amendments, but his object was that the second clause, dealing with the second class comprising the heterogeneous number of officers, labourers and servants, should be made adoptive&#x2014;that was to say, every county council who wished to adopt it could do so, and those county councils who did not wish to adopt it should have the discretion of not adopting it.</p>

<image src="S5LV0004P0I0196"/>
<col>379</col>
although sometimes his work might be indirect? The supervision might be acute and active, and yet on some occasions might not be direct. He might have intermittent charge and intermittent control, sometimes direct and sometimes indirect. An element of doubt would certainly be introduced by the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01472"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> hoped the noble Lord would not press his Amendment. He thought it might occasion cases of hardship. A case in point had been furnished by Lord Beauchamp. Sometimes a dairyman was in charge and sometimes he was not. The same was the case with the cook and the laundress. All these cases varied at different times in different asylums, and if the noble Lord tied them down as he proposed hardship might be inflicted. In regard to his Amendments to Clause 2, the noble Lord went to the other extreme, because he left the matter entirely to the local authorities. One of the principles of this Bill was uniformity, and that proposal of the noble Lord was contrary to the principle of uniformity. He was not sure whether the effect of the noble Lord's Amendment with regard to Clause 2 might not be quite different from what he had anticipated. Supposing it had the effect of making a generous local authority put everyone into class one and so increase the rates. That possibly would be open to objection. However that might be, he thought it would impose hardships amongst that class of officers whose places could not be very accurately defined.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01482"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that before their Lordships proceeded to consider this clause he would like to address a question to the Government with regard to its general meaning. When the noble Earl the Lord Steward just now said he would accept an Amendment he seemed to be taking rather more than the benevolent interest which the Lord Chancellor told their Lordships the Government had in the Bill. He really thought the noble Earl was quite right, and he greatly regretted that the Bill was not a Government Bill, because it was going to impose a very large charge on the rates and establish a system of superannuation. Of course, they could not establish a system of superannuation with regard to any particular class of public servants without reference to other classes of public servants, and there were, of course, general rules and general principles with regard to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0197"/>
<col>381</col>
superannuation which really could only be administered properly and considered properly by the Government, because the Government had the whole question of superannuation under its direct supervision and control. For instance, he saw by the Bill that the superannuation allowance was to be computed at the rate of one-fiftieth of the salary and emoluments for each completed year of service. In the Civil Service, as they knew, it was one-sixtieth. Although he had a great deal of confidence in his noble friend Lord Monk Bretton, at the same time when they were establishing a scale of superannuation he questioned whether his noble friend had at his disposal, and a sufficient acquaintance with, the general principles and general rules and practice of superannuation to enable him to be a great authority on the subject. The Government, of course, were in quite a different position, and he presumed that a Bill of this sort, imposing as it would a direct charge on the rates, must come under their careful supervision and watchful eye; and what he wanted to ask the noble Earl was whether the Government had examined the whole principles of superannuation upon which the Bill was based. Had they, for instance, considered the scale of salaries, because by adding to the existing scale of salaries a right to superannuation was equivalent to a very large increase of salary. Take, for instance, the superior officers in asylums who had large salaries; their superannuation would be proportionately large, and it was more in regard to them than with regard to labourers and the smaller persons that really this increase would be felt. Therefore, what he wished to ask the Government was whether the Home Office had thoroughly considered the pecuniary results of the Bill and the principles upon which it was based, and did the Treasury approve of it, because rumours had got about&#x2014;they were very general and might have no solid basis&#x2014;that there was something not quite correct about the pecuniary foundation of this Bill, and that the Government themselves were not altogether satisfied with it in its present form. He would be much obliged to the noble Earl if he could tell him what part of the scheme the Government approved of and whether they approved of it in its present form.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01483"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that after the recent rebuke of the noble Earl he rose with
<col>382</col>
some diffidence to reply to him. The noble Earl had said the Government had assumed too much responsibility.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01484"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I did not say so at all. On the contrary, I wish His Majesty's Government would assume the sole responsibility.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01485"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that undoubtedly the noble Earl objected to his early intervention on behalf of the Government when the noble Lord opposite moved an Amendment. He could only tell the noble Earl that the position of the Government with regard to this Bill was exactly what it would be with regard to any Bill introduced by a private member in either House of Parliament. It was quite impossible to suppose that His Majesty's Government could accept responsibility for every word and every detail of every clause in the Bill as it appeared before their Lordships at this moment. He did not suppose any one except the draftsmen ever thought any Bill perfect and incapable of improvement. The Home Office and the Treasury had examined the principle of this Bill, and, as their Lordships heard on the Second Reading, the Government approved the principle, which was to give superannuation to asylum officers. Towards that principle His Majesty's Government adopted a very benevolent attitude. Then the noble Earl asked whether the Government approved of the Bill exactly as it stood to-day. He would ask the noble Earl to what Bill he referred. Did he refer to the Bill before their Lordships at this moment or to the Bill in the shape that it would assume after it had been through Committee of their Lordships' House and after various Amendments they hoped to insert in the course of the discussion had been accepted? It seemed to him quite impossible for the Government to approve of the Bill on the Table now, and also to approve of the Bill after it had been amended in their Lordships' House. The position was inconsistent. But what he could say was that not only did His Majesty's Government approve of the principle but they also believed and hoped that when the Bill had undergone amendment, it would be a Bill to which every one of their Lordships could give an unqualified approval.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01486"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> was afraid the noble Earl did not apprehend the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0198"/>
<col>383</col>
question he had put to him. He asked the noble Earl whether the Government approved of the financial arrangements of the Bill as it now stood. He (Lord Camperdown) did not know what their Lordships' House would do, but he presumed that the Government, taking as they did a benevolent interest in the Bill, had looked into the financial arrangements, and he wanted to know whether they approved of the scale of superannuation proposed in the Bill. That was his question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01487"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> said the question of the scale came under the consideration of the Select Committee of the House of Commons, and he believed the scale was founded on the Lunacy Act of 1890; the proportion there was one-fiftieth, and that was without contribution, whereas this was with contribution. So far as he knew, the Report of the Select Committee was unanimous on the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01488"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend Lord Camperdown raised one point which seems to me of considerable importance, namely, whether in connection with this question of pensions the question of salaries has also been considered. This Bill, I understand, will render pensionable a number of officers who at present are not pensionable. I had always been led to believe that a pension was a form of deferred salary, and therefore it does seem to follow that if these persons are to be pensionable hereafter, the whole question of their salary would naturally come under review; and I think the question of my noble friend was whether there had been such a review of the salaries of these officers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01489"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I think the best course would be this. We have not a Treasury officer here, and although I am myself officially interested in the subject-matter, I am not concerned in any part of the financial considerations. The question having been asked, we will certainly inquire of the Treasury, and at a later stage of this Bill we will give the direct answer which the noble Marquess desires. If the House will exercise its own judgment with regard to this scale of pensions we will certainly inquire of the Treasury what they think of the subject and communicate with the House at the next stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01490"><member>LORD BELPER</member> moved an Amendment substituting twenty for fifteen years as
<col>384</col>
the qualifying period of service, and fifty-five instead of fifty as the age when an officer should be entitled to claim superannuation allowance. He hoped it would not be thought that he in any way posed as an authority with regard to what was the proper scale. If they got some authoritative statement from the Treasury as to what was a reasonable scale he would willingly withdraw his Amendments. But he could not conceal from himself that if the scale as it stood in the Bill was not a reasonable one it would cause a very serious charge indeed upon the rates. Unless he was more successful in a future Amendment than he was in the last, this Bill would create an enormous number of pensionable people whom many believed it was not at all necessary to pension, and whose pensions would form a very dangerous precedent with regard to other county council officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01491">There was a very strong feeling indeed amongst county councils that at all events so far as officers like clerks and others who were not directly in charge of patients were concerned, a discretion should be given to county councils as to whether they should give them pensions or not. When the county councils were first established, many of them passed a resolution against giving pensions to their servants. They gave their servants adequate and even liberal salaries, and told them it would be their business to make what provision they could out of their salaries for their old age, and it seemed to him that it would be a very unfair and dangerous thing to lay down by a Bill of this sort a principle which might have to be adopted afterwards with regard to all sorts of officials of county councils, because there would be no distinction between some of the officers who would be made pensioners under this Bill and others who would be serving county councils in other similar offices, but did not receive pensions. In those circumstances he felt bound to make some inquiries with regard to the figures in this Bill, and certainly to raise the question. He did not pretend to be an authority on this matter, but he raised the question so that those of their Lordships who were conversant with such matters could deal with the Amendments as they came up.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01492">His first Amendment was that the service should be twenty years and not fifteen. Fifteen seemed to him a very short service
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0199"/>
<col>385</col>
to entitle one to a pension, especially when they were dealing with oases of officers who were permanently incapacitated. Then he proposed that instead of the age of fifty at which they should be entitled to retire, it should be fifty-five. He had made some inquiries with regard to this matter, and was informed by gentlemen who had some knowledge of these points that it would be very fair to leave a discretion as to the age from fifty to sixty&#x2014;that was to say, to allow the authorities a discretion as to giving the pension at fifty, fifty-five or sixty. He believed there were very strong objections to leaving a discretion in this matter, particularly in a Bill which aimed at uniformity, and it might be that an officer received a pension at fifty in one asylum while another would not receive it till fifty-five or sixty. He did not wish to raise any difficulty of that sort, and therefore he had taken what he considered a moderate figure&#x2014;namely, a mean between fifty and sixty, which, he thought, would be some relief to the fund which would have to be provided for these officers, and would be on the whole a fair compromise. They had in the Police Act a good example as to the effect of pensions of this sort. That Act was year by year becoming a larger and more serious charge on the counties. The amount of money county councils had to pay out of the rates to meet the charges of the police pensions in some counties was as much as &#x00A3;4,000 and in one instance even &#x00A3;4,700, while in a great many others it was over &#x00A3;1,000. The average of the counties he took&#x2014;they were not all large and some were small&#x2014;was &#x00A3;2,000 a year. That was a serious matter, and not only that, but towards the expenses of the police a very large sum was paid by the Treasury&#x2014;&#x00A3;300,000 a year, he believed, out of which every county council got a proportion. Under this Bill, however, the county councils would get no contribution at all from the Treasury, although the charge was likely to be a large one.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01494"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member> did not know what line the noble Lord in charge of the Bill was going to take with regard to this Amendment, but he earnestly hoped he would not assent to it too readily, and that, in fact, he would
<col>386</col>
oppose it. He hoped it would not be forgotten that in this matter they were dealing very largely with women. It was one thing to say that a policeman might go on, but it was quite another thing to say that a woman having the extra ordinarily difficult and trying charge of lunatics was to go on till fifty-five years of age before she was entitled voluntarily to retire on a pension. The point was one which ought not to be overlooked, and he deprecated anything which would have the effect of discouraging asylum workers from remaining in the public service and tempting them to transfer their services to private service. He had ventured on the Second Reading to remind their Lordships that whereas police and Poor Law officers could not find something akin to what they were doing which could tempt them else where by a slight increase of salary, there was a large number of private institutions to which the asylum officer might go. The last thing which it should be their desire to do was to discourage asylum officers, and, above all, the women, who might be tempted to find a place where they would receive a little more and leave the public institutions to perhaps an inferior grade of officer. Therefore, he hoped their Lordships would err on the side of generosity and not niggardliness with regard to the number of years service and age.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01495"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he agreed with everything the most rev. Primate had said. There was nothing novel about this Bill. It had been thrashed out by a Select Committee and legislation of the kind had more than once been proposed. His noble friend speaking on behalf of local authorities, forgot to say that of the county councils of England four-fifths were in favour of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01496"><member>LORD BELPER</member> begged the noble and learned Lord's pardon. They had not got any figures at all from half the county councils, and therefore it was not quite fair to say that four-fifths of the county councils in England were in favour of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01497"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he remembered his noble friend's statement perfectly well. His noble friend was the chairman of the County Councils Association, and no one spoke with greater authority or was heard with greater respect on the question. What his noble friend said was that the circular was issued to every county council in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0200"/>
<col>387</col>
England. Therefore, every county council in England had an opportunity of expressing its opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01498"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: Many of them have not met since.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01499"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said it was reasonable to suppose that if the county councils had any feeling against this Bill they would have made themselves distinctly heard. Could there be any analogy between the procedure in this Bill and the relief given under the Police Acts? There was no kind of analogy. The services were widely different. No one who knew the police and who knew what they had to undergo grudged them any liberal treatment they might receive, but those who had been in asylums&#x2014;and it had been his lot to visit many, for he had always taken a deep interest in the work&#x2014;would recognise the importance of the work and the enormous mental strain on the men and women there; it was a strain on their nerves, on their strength, and on their powers of endurance. There was everything that entitled them to sympathy. Therefore he thought this a necessary Bill to give fair play to a very important class. The object of the Bill was to try and work out a uniform scale of justice. If they gave a discretion as to the class in which the officials were placed they would run the risk of different methods of treatment being dealt out. There were fair and reasonable, and, if they liked, generous public bodies. He did not wish to say that any public body approached questions in a mean, niggardly, and ungenerous spirit. Other people might say those things, but he did not; but it was desirable, in trying to work out a system of retirement, to have a method of payment in the way of pension that would be compulsory, that would ensure fair play all round, and that would prevent unjust and unfair discrimination. That was the principle in this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01500">His noble friend suggested an Amendment that the period of service should be changed from fifteen to twenty years, and the age from fifty to fifty-five as the scale for the higher class of officials. He did not think the figures named in the Bill were unreasonable. They were dealing now with the class who were in direct contact, and who had the greatest strain on their nerves, on their strength, and on their powers of endurance, and if they wanted to do that class justice they must name a
<col>388</col>
comparatively moderate number of years service. Was not fifteen years a very substantial time for people to be asked to undergo work in a lunatic asylum, with all its painful surroundings, great trials, and sometimes grave danger? His noble friend sought to change the period of service to twenty years. It was a question of degree. He himself agreed with the most rev. Primate. He would prefer seeing fifteen years to twenty years. He was even more strongly opposed to the age being raised from fifty to fifty-five years. Wear and strain aged people. They could not subject a person to a very hard and trying series of conditions such as obtained in lunatic asylums without imposing a great strain on the vital powers. He agreed with what the most rev. Primate had said about the female officers in asylums, and although his opinions were stronger on the subject of age than on the number of years service he was unable to bring himself to believe that the proposals in his noble friend's Amendment would be an improvement to the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01501"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> could not help thinking it would be a good thing if their Lordships discussed this question in a rather more businesslike spirit. The noble and learned Lord who had just spoken had made an eloquent appeal on behalf of fixed pensions&#x2014;pensions that should be given by all local bodies. He thought they were all agreed about that. He understood the Bill was based upon the supposition that there was to be a fixed scale. The noble and learned Lord had told them that the county councils would have been up in arms at once if they had objected to the Bill, and that their Lordships would have heard about it. He could assure the noble and learned Lord that although no doubt he knew Ireland perfectly well he knew nothing about county councils in England if he thought they would do any such thing. County councils in England never moved except at their regular meetings and at the instance of certain committees which had these matters in their charge. The committees reported to the county councils, and the councils came to a decision. Generally, it was true, they took the opinion of the committee; but there had been no opportunity for the county councils to give their opinion on this Bill. It would require a very much more drastic and serious matter to stir up the county councils to have special meetings and to communicate with the central association.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0201"/>
<col>389</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01502">It appeared to him that they had heard a great deal of philanthropic talk. The most rev. Primate had told them that these were most deserving cases, and especially the cases of women. The corollary to that speech which suggested itself to him was that the most rev. Primate should make provision for a separate class, if necessary, so as to pension women at an earlier age than men. But what they wanted to know, and what he felt in the dark about, was what was the charge going to be upon the rates. That was a question no one could answer. Here was a Bill that the Government had under their protection, and yet they had no conception of what it would put upon the rates. This just showed the great importance which the rates had in the eyes of His Majesty's Government! They did not care a brass farthing so long as they got a little popularity. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill could tell them nothing except that a Committee of the House of Commons had thrashed the matter out. He had no information about the Committee of the other House. It might have been a Committee thoroughly qualified to go into the financial circumstances; but they had no knowledge of that. The noble Lord who moved the Amendment had himself told them he did not know whether this was right or wrong. The Government told them that they would make inquiries. They had fathered the Bill, so to speak, without knowing anything of the financial position, but they would make inquiries and would tell the House. What on earth were their Lordships going to do now? How were they to deal with these Amendments? Would the noble Lord who moved the Amendment tell him on what basis he was to form his opinion? He did not know whether the Amendment would bring within due limits the increase in the rates which would be imposed on local authorities by the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01503">There was one thing they seemed to forget when they talked about the great necessity for pensions. All local authorities when they fixed the salaries of their <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i>, just like everybody else, took into consideration the question whether those <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> could look for a pension or not. It was all very well to say these officials would have no pensions. No, they would have no pensions, but presumably they had in consequence higher salaries than they otherwise would have. It might be right to make a hard-and-fast rule that
<col>390</col>
certain classes in lunatic asylums should be entitled to pensions, but before they could decide upon the scale of those pensions and the age at which they should be received they should have some idea of what the cost was going to be. All the speeches about the great desirability of considering those who were exposed to danger and so forth seemed to him to be beside the mark. First of all, they wanted to know what they were going to impose upon the local authorities, and, until he knew that, he for his part did not feel inclined to vote for any Amendment at all. He suggested that they had better postpone the Amendments until the Government were able to give them some information on the point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01504"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> said he did not know what information the noble Duke had upon the subject of the opinion of the county councils which was not at his (Lord Clifford's) command; but when he spoke of the majority of the county councils being in favour of the Bill he distinctly said that that approval was not to be taken as an approval of the scale or an approval of the right to pensions of any except those who were in direct care and control of the patients. They might be in favour of the scale and of everything in the Bill, but he did not take it, so far as any information he had went, that that was the amount of their consent. When they were shown a Bill and were asked if they were in favour of it, if they were in favour of the general principles they said they were in favour of the Bill. There might be many details they did not accept. Therefore, to say that the county councils or the majority of them were in favour of the Bill absolutely as it stood and of everything in it appeared to be an unwarranted assertion. The most rev. Primate had said that this was a matter which chiefly concerned women. He did not know what experience the most rev. Primate had had of that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01505"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: I said "largely women."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01506"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> said his experience was that it did not affect women chiefly, because although the majority of asylum attendants might be women, few of them, compared with the men, stayed on long enough to get a

<col>391</col>
pension, either under the scale as it was in the Bill or under the scale as proposed by the Amendment. Therefore, it was hardly true to say that this Bill would affect the women attendants rather than the men. Another argument in favour of having the age at fifty-five instead of fifty was that by Clause 9, fifty-five was the age in the Bill at which the committee was empowered to place an attendant on compulsory pension; and it would be more uniform if the two ages, the age at which the servant could demand a pension and the age at which the committee could oblige him to take one, were the same.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01507"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> said it had been objected that the county councils had had no opportunity of stating their views because they had not met for their quarterly meetings. In the case of his own county council the circular, was issued before the last quarterly meeting, and the county council did reply. The noble Duke had told him that he ought to say what was going to be the effect of this Bill on the rates. He did not think any one, however clever, could say that, because it must be a matter of speculation to a certain extent. That was the case with the Police Act and with the Poor Law Act, and it must be exactly the same in regard to this Bill. They could not tell exactly what the effect would be on the rates, but they could say that whereas in the Police Act a man got his pension on the basis of the salary he was receiving at the date of his retirement, under this Bill there was a ten years basis and that made it cheaper for the rates. His position as being in charge of the Bill was a singular one. The benevolent interest of the Government might be a sort of suspended judgment. He was not quite sure whether their friendship was much more than a name. He had to accept an Amendment or not, and to hope that the Government would agree and would not condemn the Bill afterwards. In the circumstances he was going to strain the matter as far as he possibly could, and to say, on behalf of the promoters, that they would accept both these Amendments, but on the distinct understanding that nothing else was added in reference to the scale. If there was any further question of changing the scale the Bill would be wrecked. The great authorities of London and of Liverpool, which represented a very large proportion of the asylum services of the United
<col>392</col>
Kingdom, gave terms at the present time very much more favourable than the terms under this Bill. If the terms in the Bill were made less favourable than set out in these Amendments, then the asylum officers in those asylums would prefer to receive the better scale than the compulsory scale which would then be proposed under the Bill. It was on the express understanding stated that he accepted the Amendment of the noble Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01508"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> was sure everybody in the House would recognise the willingness of the noble Lord to meet the criticisms which had been devoted to this portion of the Bill. A good deal in the debate had carried him (Earl Beauchamp) on to somewhat unfamiliar ground, but that was not the case in regard to the denunciations which the noble Duke had poured upon His Majesty's Government. Then he realised that they were in the same House of Lords as that to which they had been accustomed during the past few weeks. There was something a good deal reminiscent of other discussions on other Bills in what the noble Duke had said on the subject of His Majesty's Government. There was this, however, to be said, that the denunciations were quite impartially poured. They were poured not only upon His Majesty's Government, but also on some of those who sat on the same benches as the noble Duke himself. With regard to the questions which the noble Duke had put to the Government, it was difficult to say exactly what was the meaning attached to such words as "due limits." The noble Duke asked whether the Amendments would bring the expenditure upon the rates within "due limits." It was not unlikely that the noble Duke and himself would differ upon the subject as to what they thought "due limits."</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01510"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said it was even more likely that the majority of the Government would differ from the noble Duke as to what were "due limits" in this matter. He could only say that it was quite impossible for the Treasury to give an estimate of what the cost to the rates would be. The cost to the rates would be different in every county throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. There
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0203"/>
<col>393</col>
were counties which had a great many asylums, in which the cost would be a great deal more than in the more fortunate places where there was only a single asylum. Therefore it was quite impossible to offer to their Lordships any figures which would be immediately reliable. He thought the course of the discussion showed the wisdom of the noble Lord in charge of the Bill in accepting the Amendment, because even amongst his own supporters there, were differences of opinion. In regard to the most rev. Primate, it was noticeable that while he thought the Amendment might go rather far with regard to women he did not say He thought it went too far with regard to men. However that might be, he ventured to think that after what had fallen from the noble Lord in charge of the Bill their Lordships would accept the Amendment without further discussion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01511">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01512"><member>LORD BELPER</member> moved an Amendment providing that an officer of the first class should be entitled to the superannuation allowance during life "or incapacity." The object of inserting the words was, he explained, to prevent anybody who had been apparently permanently incapacitated but who might, contrary to expectation, recover, getting his pension for life, when he might be fully capable of returning to his duties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01513">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In line 21, after 'life,' to insert 'or incapacity.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Belper.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01514"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> intimated that he would accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01515"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said that if the noble Lord in charge of the Bill accepted the Amendment he did not want to offer any opposition. But surely this was rather hastily accepted. He could quite understand a man being given a pension for life if compelled to retire, but if they went on to say "during incapacity" what did they mean? A man might have gone away in broken health and might make a recovery sufficient to enable it to be said that he was no longer suffering from incapacity; but would it do any good for a man then to have his pension stopped? If a medical certificate were produced saying he was no longer
<col>394</col>
incapacitated, were they to take him back into the asylum at the old salary?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01516"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said those questions were answered in the Amendment. The Amendment was taken from the Police Act, and was thought to be a very necessary provision for dealing with the cases in question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01517">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01518"><member>LORD BELPER</member> then moved an Amendment for the purpose of making the subsection relating to officers of the second class adoptive. He explained that if this and other Amendments were agreed to the clause would read, "The managers and authorities of any asylum may, if they think fit, decide that any established officer or servant of the second class is eligible for a pension, and in that case, when he has been in the service of an asylum for not less than twenty-five years and is not less than fifty-five years old, or is permanently incapacitated from asylum duties after ten years service by injury or illness, mental or bodily, medically certified and not attributable to his own misconduct," etc. In the Amendment he wished to deal with the cases of clerks, accountants, and others employed in an asylum who were not brought to any great degree into contact with lunatics. It seemed to him that if they were to have imported into the Bill cases like the clerk who was responsible to the asylum committee for keeping their books or of accountants or other officials of that sort, it would be a precedent which it would be almost impossible to resist if they were asked for pensions in the cases of officers of other committees of county councils. He believed this particular case was met in another way by an Amendment which would be moved at a later stage by Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, whose Amendment might possibly be almost as effective as his own. The only difference would be that his Amendment would give to an asylum authority who did not wish to put anybody into the second class the power of saying they would not do so, while Lord Clifford of Chudleigh's Amendment gave discretion as to what officers they should put into the second class. He would be willing to meet the Committee in regard to these Amendments if Lord Clifford of Chudleigh's Amendments were accepted. But in the meanwhile he would move his first Amendment because he was representing
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0204"/>
<col>395</col>
county councils who were very anxious not to have this obligation put upon them of giving pensions to a large number of the officers to whom he had referred.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01520"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> was very disappointed to hear the noble Lord argue his Amendment, because he thought he had agreed to its withdrawal. He did not like the Amendment, as it destroyed the principle of uniformity, which was one of the main objects of the Bill. As he had pointed out, if they eliminated the second class they very likely drove a larger number into class one, and therefore increased the rates. He certainly preferred the Amendment of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh to that which had just been moved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01521"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> hoped the noble Lord would adhere to his Amendment, because it seemed to him to be a safeguard against the ratepayers being unduly oppressed in this matter of very serious expenditure. It also afforded an opportunity for dealing with special cases which deserved treatment although they did not come under the general rule. He thought that in this Bill they could not lay too great stress upon the importance of considering the increasing liabilities of the unfortunate ratepayer, whom nobody seemed to care about at the present day and upon whom all sorts of burdens were put, merely for popularity. It was desirable that this, among other, safeguards should be inserted. Mention had been made of an Amendment to be moved subsequently which possibly might amount to much the same thing. He hoped that whether Lord Belper's Amendment was pressed or not, that of Lord Clifford would be adopted, and the principle adhered to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01522"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> supported the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, and hoped the Amendment would not be pressed.

This was in the Bill as it passed the Select Committee in another place, and the London County Council felt that the omission of such power&#x2014;their Lordships would grant it was a power&#x2014;would occasion great hardship, as without it no officer could be pensioned although he had served for at least ten years in some cases. It was quite true there might be some relief under the Workmen's Compensation Act, but that would not apply to all the cases that might arise. The medical superintendents and most of the assistant medical officers and other high officials would be excluded from adequate provision in the event of disablement due, for instance, to the attack of a patient. He was advised that there had been many such cases, and owing to the fact that high officials did run serious risks the London County Council felt very strongly that it was desirable that this power should be continued.</p>

When the Bill was introduced in the House of Commons it was suggested that the amount should be based on the amount of salary at the date of retirement. The Select Committee appointed to inquire into the matter altered the basis to the average of the last five years, but the Bill put it at ten years, and he desired to restore the basis recommended by the Select Committee. He did not pretend that he would not have preferred to restore the Bill to its original form as introduced to the House of Commons. That, however, was not altogether practicable. The London County Council submitted that the Bill would inflict a definite hardship on their <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i>, who expected a pension calculated on the basis of their salary during the last five years. Those officers who came under the Poor Law Officers' Superannuation Act, 1896, had their pensions calculated on the basis of their last five years' earnings, and he was glad to see that the Home Office, in giving evidence before the Select Committee, supported the same view.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01687"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is the most slovenly Bill that has been presented to your Lordships during the present session. It will be seen that the title does not cover the contents of the Bill, and I imagine that in the other House of Parliament it would have been the duty of the clerks to rule it out. From the title of the Bill, which sets forth that it is "an Act to amend the Metropolitan Police Acts, 1829 to 1899, and to make better provision for the widows and children of constables who lose their lives in the execution of their duty," one would naturally suppose that it merely relates to the Metropolitan Police; but when one looks at the Bill one finds that it alters the pensions of the police all over England. Further, it proposes a much more extraordinary change; it proposes to alter the pensions of the police all over Scotland. The Government have been so successful in their plan of concealment that the change proposed in this Bill was not discovered in Scotland by a great many town councils until quite recently. They have now sent petitions and representations pointing out how extremely wrong it is to amend an Act which applies to Scotland by means of a clause in an Act which apparently relates only to the Metropolitan Police. Moreover, there are divers bad pieces of drafting in the Bill, owing probably to the fact that the original draftsmen are no longer with us. The result is that we have Bills like the Development Bill with similar faults in them, and if it were not

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01721"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>, who had a series of Amendments standing in his name, said the state of the law was in some confusion, as local performances were authorised by various different authorities although under almost identical circumstances. There were three sets of provisions by which such performances were allowed, and they differed in each case. He had no desire to introduce
<col>414</col>
further confusion but it was an anomaly that in the case of a large borough, which was not absolutely a county borough but was a long distance from a county town, it should be in the power of the county council to force people to travel that distance in order to obtain a licence for their exhibition. He would suggest that such boroughs should be allowed to grant licences in their own area. It had been suggested that there might be a difficulty from the fact that the magistrates were the authority for granting music and dancing licences, and to meet the difficulty the Government proposed to introduce voluntary delegation that did not exist in the present authorities. In order to meet the case he would propose to let the Bill stand in its present shape, and, instead of moving the printed Amendments, to add at the end of Clause 6 the following words, "In the exercise of the powers of delegation as provided in the preceding section, the provisions of this Act shall apply in the case of a borough council and an urban district council as if that council were a county council."</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01723"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the Government were unable to accept the Amendment even in its amended form. The purport of the Bill as it stood was perfectly clear. Cinematograph exhibitions owing to their inflammable character required special regulations and had to be carefully watched. The places in which these exhibitions were generally held were in some cases under the jurisdiction of visiting justices, and in others under a district council. It was difficult in the Bill to deal with the different localities, and for that reason the Government had deemed it better to give the power of licensing the exhibitions to the county council, or allow them to delegate it to bodies having similar powers. It must be agreed on all hands that it was better to entrust this power to the county councils with their wide experience than to small local bodies.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01761"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member> moved to amend the new Clause D which the Commons had inserted in the place of Clause 22. The Commons' Amendment ran&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01762">Leave out clause 22, and insert the following new clause:
<quote>D. Where in any area a local authority, company, or person is authorised to supply electricity under Act of Parliament or under licence or Provisional Order granted under the Electric Lighting Acts, it shall not, after the passing of this Act, be lawful for any other local authority, company, or person to commence to supply, distribute, or transmit electricity within the same area unless such supply, distribution, or transmission is authorised by Act of Parliament, or by licence or Provisional Order granted in terms of the Electric Lighting Acts. Provided that this section shall not prevent any company or person from affording a supply of electrical energy to any other company or person where the business of the company or person affording the supply is not primarily that of the supply of electrical energy to consumers.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01763">The noble Earl said: In moving the Amendment of which I have given notice may I say that I have cut out the words "transmit" and "transmission" in Clause D of the Commons' Amendments. Under this clause, as at present drafted, a company

may afford a supply of electrical energy to any other company subject to the provision at the end of the clause. There can be no reason why that same company should not be able by private arrangement to transmit electrical energy subject to the same provision. The question really is one of wayleaves. If any one else's land is in between it will be necessary to obtain power from Parliament, under the clause as at present drafted, in order to transmit the supply of electrical energy across that land. I do not think the noble Lord in charge of the Bill will object to my Amendment.</p>

The effect of the Amendment is to meet a difficulty with regard to a practical agreement which had been come to by the Midland Railway Company to have power supplied to them for some large new works at Derby. The difficulty arose in consequence of part of those works being within the town of Derby; and without wishing to strike out the whole of the Amendments in Clause D I have tried to arrange a reasonable means of meeting the difficulty by the insertion of words at the end of Clause D. The point is not a very large one, but I think it is only fair that some means should be found of meeting such a difficulty, and I think the Amendment that I propose will not only commend itself to your Lordships' House, but also to the other House of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<col>421</col>
energy from affording a supply to a railway company for purposes incidental to that company's undertaking other than the conveyance of public traffic.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Belper.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01769"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: This new Clause D was inserted in the other House of Parliament because certain established undertakers were afraid of an undertaking which had been set up in Scotland whereby certain unauthorised undertakers proposed to give a supply of electricity for commercial purposes. The fear of the authorised undertakers was that these people might take some of the plums of their business, that they might supply to their best customers, and they thought that this was not fair to them. I think the general feeling was that there was a good deal in that contention. However, the Government did not see their way to accept the clause which was originally proposed for the protection of the authorised undertakers, because it would have prevented a man who had a generating station at his residence or works from giving a supply to his neighbours by private arrangement, except with the consent of the authorised undertakers. The Government thought that that clause went rather too far; but eventually another clause was brought forward in the form in which it now appears on the Paper, and that clause the Government accepted. Your Lordships will observe that the prohibition to supply only exists in cases where there is an authorised undertaker in the district, and your Lordships will also observe that it does not apply where the unauthorised supply was commenced before the passing of this Act, I had hoped that this proviso would meet any complaint as to a hard case on account of interference with existing undertakings. Of course, your Lordships will see that it is desirable as a general rule that undertakings for the supply of electricity to customers should be under statutory authority, and we think that it is in the interests, not only of the consumers but of the local authority as well, that that should be so. I am very sorry that the case which the noble Lord has referred to does not come under that exemption, but our position is this, that as the Government accepted the clause in the other House I am not prepared to agree to the Amendment, which the promoters of the clause as it stands may think goes beyond the case aimed at, and it might, in their view, nullify the clause. I cannot accept the noble Lord's Amendment, but if he wishes
<col>422</col>
to press it I shall not put your Lordships to the trouble of dividing against it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01771">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01772"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment which I now move provides that this section&#x2014;Clause D&#x2014;as amended by the House of Commons, shall not prevent any company from affording a supply of electrical energy to any other company or person who are shareholders, or other persons associated with the company affording the supply. The reason for this is that power companies have often failed to give the supply contemplated, and manufacturers and consumers of electricity have, therefore, not hitherto been able to benefit largely from supplies given by power companies. It is not infrequent for a manufacturer who has a large electrical plant to afford a supply to his friends and neighbours, the result being that through the better load factor and lower cost of supply the cost all round is reduced. Under Clause D of the Commons' Amendments this principle is recognised; but the principle has in certain instances been further developed, and it is not uncommon for a supply on co-operative lines to be arranged for&#x2014;that is to say, instead of a manufacturer supplying other companies&#x2014;which he can do under this clause as it stands, subject to the provision at the end of the clause&#x2014;for those other companies to join in the cost of putting down the plant. To take a concrete case, assume that a colliery company is about to put down coking plant and proposes to adopt the German method of utilising the waste gases and heat for the purpose of driving electrical plant. As Clause D stands, so long as the colliery company finds the capital itself it could supply its neighbours with electrical energy, subject to that last provision in Clause D; but if the colliery company's neighbours join in putting down the plant, it becomes at once a question which is the primary and which is the subsidiary object&#x2014;that is to say, whether the generation of electrical energy is the primary object and coke the by-product or <i>vice versa</i>. The neighbouring local authority would naturally contend the former and apply for an injunction. I see no objection myself to this

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01774"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: I think I have some right to complain that I have only had notice of this Amendment five minutes before the sitting of the House. As the Commons' Amendments have been before your Lordships since the middle of August, I think I have some cause of complaint of the lateness of the notice given of this particular Amendment. But what I would say with regard to it is this. I explained to your Lordships the reason on account of which the Government accepted this new Clause D; it was because we wished to prevent any unauthorised persons from poaching in the areas of the authorised undertakers for the supply of electricity; but we do not wish to prevent a supply between neighbours; nor do we wish to interfere with arrangements which have been entered into before the passing of the Act. I think the suggestion of the noble Lord, however, really goes a good deal beyond that, because, as I understand, what he proposes amounts practically to a co-operative company for the supply of electricity within certainly a limited area, and as that goes very much further than was contemplated when the exception was agreed to I am afraid that the Government cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01775"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: As regards the co-operative supply for the provision of electrical energy, they would be subject to the same provision as under Clause D of the Commons' Amendments. They would not be able to supply electrical energy to anybody if their business was primarily that of supplying electrical energy to consumers. It is a small point and it comes to this, whether one company can provide electricity to, say, two other companies for their own consumption, or whether those three companies may join together in putting down plant to provide themselves with electrical energy. That is the whole point of my contention. I do not wish to press my Amendment unless I receive some support from the House.</membercontribution></p>
<col>424</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01776"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: The difference between this Amendment and Clause D as it stands is, as my noble friend says, an extremely narrow one. It is very difficult to see how the Amendment as it stands can be defended, because, as it seems to me, if two of these companies agreed together they might easily have a private agreement for one of them to be the supplier and to supply the others. The line is so very narrow that I hardly see myself how you can defend an Amendment which allows a company to supply to three or four other companies but does not allow two of those companies to join together and each pay their share of supplying it to the two other individuals. It really comes down to a point of very small difference, and the only question is whether it will not be got round even if the clause is left to stand as it is.</membercontribution></p>

and to substitute for it a long clause which their Lordships would see upon the Paper. It was an important Amendment, but it did not in any way go to the principle of the Bill. The principle of the Bill had reference to letting houses, and it was, in the first place, that no agreement should be binding which was made two months before the entry took place; and, in the second place, power was given to any house-owner or tenant to terminate the tenancy, provided that sufficient notice was given, at the time of the next payment of rent. The third portion of the principle of the Bill was that which freed from the right of hypothec the goods of a tenant up to &#x00A3;10. The Amendment which he was going to propose affected only the manner in which rates were to be imposed and levied. That was a subsidiary matter altogether, although in this case a very important one. It was specially important in the case of Glasgow, and really the Bill was started by Glasgow and some of the large towns where the population was migratory, and it had comparatively little effect in and certainly was not taken much interest in by the other towns. They were all indifferent to the Bill, except in so far as they opposed it in its altered form. Their wishes, as he would show their Lordships presently, were met by his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01796">The effect of the Bill would be largely to increase the number of what were termed short lets&#x2014;that was to say, lets which were for less than the term of one year&#x2014;in the large towns, and it was because those lets would be increased that the whole question of the difficulty of the imposition and collection of rates arose. Under Section 343 of the Burgh Police Act, which had been adopted in most of the towns in Scotland and which it was in the power of all the remaining towns to adopt whenever they saw fit, the landlord was responsible for the rates of his tenant where the let was a short one. The demand for the rates was made upon the occupier and the rate was imposed upon the occupier, but if the occupier failed to meet his obligation then recourse was had to the owner, and their Lordships must bear in mind that that was the essential difference between the system of compounding and the system which was established under the Burgh Police Act. The question really was how ought the increased risk which would fall upon the owners under the Bill to be met.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01797">Ever since the Second Reading of the Bill,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0220"/>
<col>427</col>
a number of their Lordships connected with Scotland who had taken great interest in the matter had had the point under consideration, and when the Bill went into Committee a proposal was made which he himself, he thought, moved, and which they hoped at that time would meet the case. That was taken exception to by the City of Glasgow, and ever since that time the Scottish Peers, with the very able and laborious assistance of Mr. Scott Dickson and Mr. Clyde, who had a very minute acquaintance, as their Lordships were all aware, as leading members of the Scottish Bar with Scottish rating law, had had the matter under almost continuous consideration. In the first place, when the City of Glasgow objected to the clause which now stood in the Bill the house-factors and house-owners also raised objections, and therefore it appeared that it would be useless to insist upon Clause 12 and that it was desirable to find some substitute. It was a very technical matter which could not be at all interesting to their Lordships, and he did not intend to go into the detail of it. They then considered the matter, and devised another clause which they hoped at one moment was agreed to, but unfortunately their expectations were falsified, because the house-owners and factors objected. He put down a clause which he believed embodied agreement and which he had hoped to move on Report, but when the Report stage was reached he found it was desirable not to move the clause. They had been considering the matter ever since, and after a fortnight of more trouble, owing to the change of mind which he thought was chiefly on the part of the house-owners and factors, they had come to the conclusion that their difference was really whittled down to a very small point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01798">Everybody was agreed, with respect to the additional risk to which house-owners would be exposed, that there ought to be a scale of deduction applicable to them in regard to their liability for the rates of their tenants; and the difficulty really only was with regard to the question whether the scale of deduction should be originated and started by the Sheriff under the Bill, or whether, on the other hand, the Bill should contain a fixed scale of rates of deduction which after a period should be subject to revision by the Sheriff if ten persons who were interested thought it desirable. To cut a long story short, they came to the conclusion that the latter was, upon the
<col>428</col>
whole, the more desirable way of proceeding, and, as their Lordships would see, that was embodied in the Amendment. There were other matters in the Amendment, but they were really matters of detail with which he did not think it necessary to trouble their Lordships at the moment, and therefore he proposed to explain very briefly the contents of the Amendment itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01799">He proposed, in the first place, for the reasons which he had given to their Lordships, to leave out Clause 12. With regard to what he proposed to substitute, if their Lordships would turn to the Amendment, they would see in the first four lines the words, "Subject to the provisions of this Act, the provisions with regard to the liability for and the imposition and recovery by an assessing authority of any assessment of all Acts applicable within the respective burghs in which this Act may be in operation shall subsist in full force and effect." The effect of those words was to preserve for all burghs except burghs with a population of above 50,000 their present modes of proceeding in the way of imposing and collecting rates. That was what the burghs originally asked for, and that was part of the clause which their Lordships would see was now in the Bill and which it was proposed to continue by his Amendment. That was all that the burghs asked for, and people ought to be content with obtaining all that they asked for.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01800">If their Lordships read on, they would see that in the larger burghs, those above 50,000, there were certain provisions to apply and have effect. The first would be found in the proviso that where a small dwelling-house was let for a year or longer and the rent was payable more frequently than once in three months, that was to be deemed for the purposes of the section as a letting for less than a year. The object of that was that supposing any one were to let a house for twelve or even for fourteen months, and were to require the rent to be paid at monthly intervals, it would be possible then for him to entirely evade the provisions of Section 345 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act. It seemed to them that that was an undeniable fact, and therefore they thought it was desirable to insert this provision in the clause. The next thing he wished to call their Lordships' attention to was that they had departed so far from the provisions of Section 345 as to limit them to small dwellings instead
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0221"/>
<col>429</col>
of land and premises which were the words in that section. His Amendment was one which was distinctly in favour of the house-owners. Again, he had included on the next page, in Section 2 (1), Section 346. That, again, was another change which was asked for by the house-owners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01801">Then there followed a scale of deductions which was fixed at seven and a-half per cent. in one case, five per cent. in another, and three per cent. in the case of houses where the rental was above &#x00A3;10, but did not exceed &#x00A3;20. The three per cent. in the case of houses of a rental above &#x00A3;10 was also in favour of the house-owners. They had adopted those fixed figures in connection with another Amendment which came later, and which dealt with the question of empty houses. He need not explain it to their Lordships at length, but the result was that where the owner could show that the house was neither let nor occupied during a certain period of the year he would be able to reclaim the amount of his assessment which he might have paid in respect of that house for that period. Those three Amendments would all have to be taken together as part of one arrangement, and they understood that that arrangement, if taken as a joint one, would be looked upon as satisfactory. They had not proceeded, when fixing the amounts, on their own unaided judgment. They had actually been suggested by a gentleman in Glasgow who was very familiar with the house agency business, and on the whole they thought that they could hardly go wrong in adopting the figures which he had suggested. There were other matters in the clause which if their Lordships desired it he could explain, but he thought that he had explained the whole principle of the Amendment. He could only say that the noble Lords representing Scotland who took part in it, and also Mr. Clyde and Mr. Scott Dickson, bestowed an enormous amount of time and trouble upon the matter. It was necessary, of course, to put something into the Bill, and all he could say was that his Amendment represented a conclusion unanimously arrived at after a very long inquiry.</p>

Your Lordships have taken control of the Bill, and it is not possible for the Government to consider that the plan now proposed by the noble Earl is a substitute for the proposals which were laid before you when the Bill came to your Lordships' House from another place.

The Clause stated that nothing in this Bill should prejudice or affect the provisions of Section 72 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847. He would have thought that that exempted Clause 72 of the Waterworks Clauses Act altogether, and it was quite clear that those who were under the provisions of that Act would not be affected. There was an Edinburgh company, however, which supplied water, and which was under an apprehension that unless the Amendment which stood in his name was inserted owners would be entitled to deduct from the water rates which they were now liable for under the Waterworks Act those deductions which had reference to the municipal rate. He himself would have thought it was quite clear that that was not so, but the persons in question were very persistent in the matter and seemed anxious about it, and he did not see that there could be any harm in inserting the words.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01830"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving that the Bill do pass, I would like to be allowed to state to you as well as I am able exactly what has happened in regard to this Bill. The Bill came up to your Lordships'
<col>434</col>
House practically with the unanimous support of the Scottish Members&#x2014;a non-party measure&#x2014;after being thoroughly considered in Grand Committee and with an unusually large body of Scottish opinion behind it. Your Lordships in Committee amended it seriously at the instance of the noble Earl opposite, and you have now amended it again on his initiative. I well know the great trouble that he and others have been to in endeavouring to grapple with this question, but the result of this alteration of the Bill has not. I think, been a happy one, and I cannot believe that it has secured the support of those interested for the Bill; and from various directions I have indications that this cannot be at any rate considered as the last of the vicissitudes of this measure. In the first place the house-owners, to which the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, made frequent allusion, have, as he knows, protested strongly against the proposals which he has now put into the Bill. I have had communications by letter and by telegram, and I see reports in the papers of meetings which they have had, strongly protesting against this solution which has now been adopted by your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Then I notice that in the Amendments which have been inserted the noble Earl has made three important changes. His solicitude for the ratepayer feeling the burden of the personal payment that he has to make in respect of rates is gone, because he does not re-introduce the Government provision which was intended to impress upon the ratepayer the amount of his personal share and contribution to I he rates. Then, again, the provision for more frequent collection of rates by municipalities is gone, and as the noble Earl himself pointed out he has been forced to accept some scale, although not considered by them satisfactory, of allowance to house-owners for the collection of rates. There are other grounds on which there is still serious opposition to this Bill. At the instance of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton, the limits of rental were introduced. I have a strong protest against that. Again at the instance of the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, parish councils were cut out of the Bill. I endeavoured to call his attention, when that operation was being performed, to the fact that the rates collected by the parish councils in Scotland amount to something like thirty-eight per cent. of the total sum collected in rates in Scotland. By cutting the parish councils
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0224"/>
<col>435</col>
out of this Bill, which purports to provide for more frequent removals and short lets, your Lordships are placing the parish councils at a considerable disadvantage. The scheme of the noble Earl is intended to meet the difficulties of the municipalities, but he does in no sense meet the difficulties of the parish councils. Parish councils can only recover their rates from the occupier whose name is on the valuation roll. That occupier has a right of recovery from subsequent occupiers, but that is a worthless power because the other occupiers may have gone east, west, north and south, and he cannot recover from them, so that the parish councils are left crippled. They have not the same security under the new system as they have at present for the collection of their rates, and obviously their whole influence will be thrown against the introduction of the system under this Bill. Your Lordships have cut away the security for the collection of their rates, and made no provision whatever for meeting their difficulties, whereas they as bodies all over Scotland are really responsible for nearly two-fifths of the total sum collected in rates. So that your Lordships have the house-owners dissatisfied, you have the working men dissatisfied, and you have the parish councils dissatisfied, the cumulative effect of the whole thing being that practically the scheme of the Bill has been entirely destroyed. Your Lordships have one perfectly clear motive, or rather the noble Earl has, in doing this&#x2014;namely, the antipathy to compounding. The noble Earl has a strong aversion to compounding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01831"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My aversion is to increasing compounding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01832"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I will pass from that point. It is a small one. In theory I am perfectly prepared to admit that the practice of composition and compounding is open to grave objection; but, after all, you cannot say that in a world of change everything is to be subject to change except this one very limited question of composition for rates for small houses. The effect of such a proposition would be to lose all perspective; it is altogether too rigid and confined a view. Look at the experience in England under the Reform Act of 1867, by which the composition of rates was abolished. A very violent agitation sprang up throughout the country at the abolition of compounding, and in the following year, 1868, the Government had to appoint a Committee to consider the
<col>436</col>
whole question. So great was the confusion and difficulty throughout the country that they appointed a Committee, on which the noble Viscount opposite served, and also another noble Lord in this House, Lord Eversley. That Committee were divided in their recommendations, and the Government, the following year, when they passed the Bates Act applying to England, threw over the Committee and practically re-introduced the system of compounding for workmen's houses in England. When that is known it is impossible to deny that the claim of the Scottish workmen for a similar privilege is an extremely strong one, and it is impossible also to believe that their claim will ever be forgotten so long as the exigencies of their occupations oblige them to move from place to place, and so long as the limitations of their income make it an extremely important thing to them whether or not they are to have too large a house on their hands and are unable to make a change.<lb/>
I am afraid that the whole mischief, if I may venture to say so, and the main substance of the antipathy to the system of compounding come from a fear of its indirect influence in possibly increasing the franchise. Some noble Lords who criticised this Bill really see nothing in it but a covert attempt to increase the franchise to these working men in Scotland. A noble Lord says "Hear, hear." If your Lordships would only believe me these working men cannot afford to look at this question from the point of view of political organisers. They are poor men, finding a great difficulty in making a living as it is, and this is a serious subtraction from their slender income which in times of depression of trade makes a substantial difference to them. This agitation draws none of its strength from any desire on the part of the working men to obtain votes. As I told your Lordships on the Second Reading, their habit is to pay for everything by instalments&#x2014;food, clothes, furniture, everything. They are obliged by the circumstances of their income, which is also paid by instalments frequently, to pay for everything by instalments, and they want this system of house-letting to fit the conditions of their life and their labour.<lb/>
There are two great classes who are affected by this Bill. In the first place, there is the class of working man who is obliged to follow his labour. He goes from Glasgow to the Tyne, or from the Tyne to Belfast, according as shipbuilding is in progress.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0225"/>
<col>437</col>
He is obliged to follow his work, and his home is broken up, we may say, every year, or at smaller intervals when he goes in search of his work. There is also a very large community of humble people who, either from an increase in their families, in which case they wish to have enlarged dwellings, or because of the death of the breadwinner of the family the widow wishes to limit her expenditure at once. Large classes of these people, who feel their circumstances keenly, wish a more elastic system of house letting, in order to fit their slender circumstances. I only wish I could have any hope that my words would be of the least avail in inducing your Lordships to believe that there is no political motive whatever in the minds of the Scottish working men in endeavouring to see this grievance remedied. The noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, in Committee, speaking with his experience as Lord Mayor of Belfast, said that they must have compounding there. Compounding is the universal experience in England, as I have related to your Lordships, and it is only Scotland which is denied this privilege.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, may I say one word as to what this dread amounts to. In the first place, these men are all taxpayers, and as taxpayers they are contributing to the revenue of the country, and even as taxpayers their claim to a Parliamentary vote is not an inconsiderable one. But let us look at the considerations from the point of view of rates. Take any figure you like as the probable addition to the number of ratepayers of Glasgow by this Bill. The present system is that they pay their rates in a lump sum at the end of the year, and it may be quite true that they are not able in many instances to pay that lump sum, accustomed as they are to pay for everything else by instalments. It may be quite true that the exacting of that lump sum at the end of the year may cause them to default, and for that reason they may be struck off the Parliamentary roll. To my mind, my Lords, that of itself constitutes a considerable injustice&#x2014;that the conditions of payment should not be better adjusted to the conditions of work and labour. But may I point out to your Lordships that this is a Bill for increasing short lets and therefore increasing removals, and in proportion as it increases removals it will militate against any extension of the franchise, because the franchise compels a considerable residence as a condition of qualifying for voting. Let
<col>438</col>
me also point out this. It is only when men pay their rates with their rents that they will be so qualified in future. The men who do not pay their rates will probably not pay their rents, and they will be turned out of their houses and will lose their votes. The men who do pay their rents will pay their rates, and they will be properly and fairly qualified, I think, to vote.<lb/>
As a matter of fact, this is a Bill which would secure, if it were in its original form, results with which I am sure your Lordships would sympathise. It would secure a more regular and systematic collection and payment of rates, because it would make it easier for working men to pay rates than it is under the present system. That is really the source of the support which municipalities give to this Bill, that it would secure a more prompt and full payment of rates, because the conditions which it proposes to introduce would further that end. Incidentally it might increase the franchise. I have given reasons for thinking that that increase would not be considerable, but your Lordships will not allow the beneficent operation of this Bill simply because in your opinion it will increase the franchise to these working men.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01834"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> was sorry that the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland should have charged them with taking the control of the Bill out of his hands, because he could assure him that they had really done nothing of the kind. They had not touched one part of the main principle of the Bill. The principle of the Bill was, as the noble Lord himself had said, to deal with short lets. Those clauses dealing with short lets remained in the Bill exactly as they were brought before their Lordships' House. The grievance which was complained of in Scotland had nothing whatever to do with the compounding of rates, which was the matter which the noble Lord had given his chief attention to. They had in Scotland, as their Lordships knew, a system of compounding which was different from the system prevailing in England. They only compounded up to &#x00A3;4 in yearly value, and by a clause or two in the Bill before them an enormous change was to be made in that system by raising the limit of compounding from &#x00A3;4 to &#x00A3;26 a year.</p>

<image src="S5LV0004P0I0226"/>
<col>439</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01836"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> said that compounding was the rule in England in every case within certain limits of rental, not necessarily connected with short lets, although they might he the incidental cause of it. He knew that the noble Lord's argument was that they could not have short letting without compounding, but as he was able to tell the noble Lord during the debate on the Second Reading, that was not the opinion held by the Departmental Committee which sat on this very Bill. It was not the opinion either of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation. Both those Committees said that compounding was not an essential corollary of short letting. He admitted that it was easier to carry out a system of short letting if they had compounding, but the two things did not necessarily go together. Everybody objected on principle to the system of compounding. The noble Lord himself objected to it, and the noble Earl who moved the Amendment had introduced a scheme which was an alternative to compounding, and one which it was quite possible to carry out in connection with compounding. That scheme was approved by all the burghs in Scotland, and they were responsible for the collection of rates in Scotland. The noble Lord shook his head, but he maintained that that was so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01837"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I shook my head for this reason, that the Amendments put in on the Committee stage were put in on precisely the same authority. The one thing that all the burghs were united upon was in their opposition to the introduction of these Amendments, and I am afraid that the noble Lord will get no further towards settling this question by appealing to the burghs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01838"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> pointed out that what the burghs really objected to was the whole thing, and they had proved themselves somewhat fickle people to deal with. The real objection was on the part of the house-owners, because the commission granted under the Bill for collecting the rates was not sufficient. That commission was intended to pay them for the additional loss which they might suffer under this new system of short letting. They were already responsible, their Lordships would recollect, for such arrears of rates as might occur under the system of short letting that now existed, and under the Amendment of the noble Earl they would in addition be
<col>440</col>
responsible for such houses as might be let for short periods and also for houses in which, even if they were let for a year, the rents were collected oftener than once in three months. What that additional loss would be no one in this country could tell. Even if it were left to the Sheriff to decide, as the house owners proposed, the Sheriff would have no <i>data</i> to go upon. No one could say what that additional loss would be, and they had thought it better&#x2014;and they were very strongly of the opinion still&#x2014;that the wisest course to adopt was the one they had adopted of putting in a covering figure, which they hoped at all events would be a sufficient commission to owners. At the end of three years from this date, they had provided that on the application of anybody the Sheriff himself would decide what the commission ought to be. At the end of that three years the Sheriff would have had sufficient experience, and there would be sufficient <i>data</i> on which he could fix the actual amount of commission. With the exception of the house-owners, he did not think they had any substantial objection to the commission. It might not be perfect, but he was glad to hear the noble Lord say that after all the present Amendment was an improvement upon the Bill, and he hoped it would work satisfactorily in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01839"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland had addressed to their Lordships a speech which was really almost a repetition of the one which he made upon the Second Reading, and therefore if some of them intruded upon their Lordships a few words which might seem more appropriate to a debate on Second Reading they must not blame them because they were answering the arguments which the noble Lord had used. The noble Lord said, in the first place, that they had interfered with a Bill which was the result of long consideration in Grand Committee. Was the noble Lord aware that the Bill was entirely altered in Grand Committee? He was unable to tell them why it had been altered, or on what information; all he said was that further consideration had taught them more about their Bill. Their Lordships would remember that the noble Lord was absolutely ignorant of the complete transformation that took place in the Bill in Grand Committee, where it was opposed by every burgh of Scotland with the exception, he thought, of Glasgow; whereas the noble Lord, when he (Lord Camperdown) mentioned it to him, told the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0227"/>
<col>441</col>
House that he was not aware of any opposition of the kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01840">Then the noble Lord said that in the Amendment he had just introduced he had done away with the personal payment of rates. He had done nothing of the kind, and he did not know what the noble Lord meant. What he had done was to provide that in burghs where at the present time the Burgh Police Act was in force it remained in force; and if any burgh hereafter adopted it&#x2014;any of those who had not adopted it at present&#x2014;subject to the scale of deduction it would come into force; and so far from doing away with personal payment of rates, what would happen would be that the occupier would be called upon to pay the rate. If he did not pay the rate and it was a short let the owner would undoubtedly be responsible. That was not doing away with the personal payment of rates. Then the noble Lord asked what was to happen to the parish councils? What had the parish councils to do with a Bill which had reference to letting? Nothing whatever. The parish councils had to do with the Poor Law, and if they wanted to alter the Poor Law let them do it directly and not in that, indirect manner. They were absolutely ignorant, even up to the present moment, of why the parish councils were ever introduced into the Bill at all. The noble Lord had said that there might be some indirect political effect on the register, although he had assured them more than once that no political consideration had anything to do with the matter. But supposing it was proved, as was clear, that the political result must be a very considerable addition to the register in the way of putting persons on the register who had not paid their rates and in respect of whose rates it was possible that no payment would be made even by the owners. If the noble Lord admitted, as he must, that that effect was produced</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01841"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to interrupt the noble Earl, but I do not admit anything of the kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01842"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that the noble Lord did not admit it, but he wished the noble Lord would show them how it could be otherwise. If a man did not pay his poor rate and if the owner did not pay it either, the occupier's name would still be upon the political register. Then with regard to the increase in the
<col>442</col>
system of compounding, the noble Lord said that the addition which he proposed to make was merely a limited one. So far from being limited, if the Bill came into force in the form in which it entered their Lordships' House, out of 175,000 houses in Glasgow nearly 160,000 would be compounded for. The noble Lord's system of compounding would be almost general, and it would only remain to the authorities to collect the rates on something like 20,000 houses in the whole of Glasgow. The noble Lord alluded to the figure of &#x00A3;26 which the Grand Committee had placed in the Bill. With the exception of the Grand Committee, there was no authority whatever for that figure of &#x00A3;26. Mr. Cross, the Member of Parliament who had introduced seven or eight Bills on the subject, never suggested such a figure as &#x00A3;26, or ever thought of it. The highest figure he ever introduced was &#x00A3;20, and that was the figure which on Lord Clinton's motion was placed in the Bill with regard to Glasgow. As to parish councils they clearly had nothing to do with the Bill, and in his humble judgment it was a very great mistake to introduce them in a Bill with regard to letting&#x2014;a Bill which altered the Poor Law, and which unquestionably, although the noble Lord said not, would have a considerable political effect. Another thing the noble Lord said was that under the Bill it would not be possible for working men to pay their rates by instalments. The reason why the clause relating to instalments had been dropped out was that in Glasgow at the present time they were just entering upon an experiment of collecting rates three times in the year at an interval of four months, and the burghs generally desired to see the result of that experiment before such a clause was introduced into the Bill. That was the chief reason why the clause did not find a place in his Amendment. He could say a good deal more on the subject, but he was unwilling to detain their Lordships further. A good deal of the discussion, he thought, would have been more appropriate to the Second Reading of the Bill; indeed they had had a great deal of it already on Second Reading, and he therefore did not propose to discuss it any further on that occasion.</p>

One Commissioner shall retire every second year, but a retiring Commissioner may be reappointed. The order in which the Commissioners first appointed are to retire shall be determined by the Treasury.

He said that his proposal was intended as an alternative to the suggestion of the Government that the term of office of the Commissions should only be for the limited period of ten years or less. As, however, he gathered that the feeling of the House was that the time should be strictly limited, he did not move his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01866"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member> moved an Amendment to Clause 5 providing that an Order under the clause should not authorise the compulsory acquisition of mines or mineral rights. He said that in Committee he ventured to ask the noble Earl in charge of the Bill in what position coal and other minerals would be under the working of the Bill. As their Lordships were aware, certain classes of property were excluded from compulsory purchase under the clause&#x2014;namely, any part of a park, garden, or pleasure ground, or a home farm, or land acquired by any corporation for the purposes of a railway, dock, canal, water, or other public undertaking. There was some uncertainty as to whether it would not be possible for the Commissioners under the Bill to acquire the surface rights and properties of companies or individuals connected with coal and other minerals. He did not think it was the intention of His Majesty's Government that property of that character should be acquired by the Commissioners, and he had only placed the Amendment on the Paper for the purpose of asking whether His Majesty's Government intended to allow coal and other mineral properties to be bought for the purposes of the Act, because it was not quite clear whether the Commissioners had or had not that power. If the noble Earl could give him an assurance that there was no such intention on the part of His Majesty's Government, he would not press his Amendment.</p>

I think I ought to point out that if the proposed new subsection of the noble Duke is inserted it might prevent a light railway, which was desired and which would be of great service to a neighbourhood, from being constructed, because it might be absolutely necessary to acquire some small portion of the surface of land under which there were minerals. I do not think there would be any great danger in leaving the clause as it stands, because the amount of compensation to be paid would be a sufficient check to any unreasonable exercising of the compulsory powers. There is no intention at all on the part of the Government to seize any land under which there are minerals for the purpose of making money out of it or anything of that sort; the power is wanted in order that a scheme of great public benefit should not be prevented from being carried out simply and solely because there happened to be minerals under a particular piece of the land that was sought to be acquired.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01870"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member> said that his Amendment related more to the surface rights which a colliery or other mineral company might be enjoying for the purpose of carrying on its operations, rather than to minerals under the ground. He did not see why a distinction should be drawn between a colliery company and a railway or dock company who acquired land for the purpose of their operations, but as the intentions of the Government appeared to be so excellent from his point of view and they did not intend that mineral rights should be acquired under the clause, he would not press the Amendment.</p>

new roads, and to insert other words confining the Board to enter into contracts for the construction and maintenance of such roads. He said that when the question was discussed in Committee the whole point taken on his side of the House was mainly in regard to whether the Road Board should or should not have the power of constructing roads, or should only be able to operate through the local authorities. Where the road was within the jurisdiction of several authorities, he saw no reason why the Board should not have the power, but if the Board in order to do that had to keep up a large and expensive staff of its own, and to have a regular works department such as they had heard a great deal about in connection with some of the large municipalities, he thought there would be a great objection to it. He did not think their Lordships could have failed to note the increase in the course of the last few weeks in the number of commissioners and boards and staffs connected with those boards which had been set up almost haphazard, and which would add tens of thousands of pounds a year to the public charge. If those boards were to be set up, they must have an adequate staff of officials and clerks in order to carry on the work, and he thought they certainly ought to guard against the additional setting up of another great department with a large technical staff empowered to employ its own labour, which he was advised it would be permissible for them to do under the words in the Bill at present. As their Lordships were aware, in a great number of cases highway authorities at present kept up their roads by contract, and there were contractors in almost every district capable of carrying out such work economically. He was convinced that nothing could be more uneconomical than for the Road Board to keep up a large and costly staff for which employment would certainly have to be found, and generally uneconomical employment, because it was always urged that public departments ought not to turn oft their workmen. He had had great experience of turning off workmen in arsenals, and the present Secretary of State for War had had a unique experience in that respect also. He hoped that both sides of the House would be unanimous with regard to his Amendment.</p>

We all know the drastic and resolute policy, if I may call it so, of the noble Viscount opposite with regard to the Works Department of the London County Council which resulted in three thousand workmen being dismissed from their employment and the breaking up of the department. I do not say a word on that subject, but the noble Viscount has a natural horror of any municipality doing work entirely on its own behalf, and seems to think that it would be to the national benefit to throw the whole of this work into the hands of contractors, who might form themselves into a ring, and, of course, command their own prices, as happened some years ago in the case of a particular work given out to contract by the London County Council. I would ask the noble Viscount and the House whether it is wise&#x2014;whether you are going to exercise it or not is another question&#x2014;to throw away the only possible means you can have of coping with a combination or ring of contractors? Again, my Lords, it is all subject to the approval of the Treasury, and it would be unlikely, in fact impossible, that the Treasury would sanction any huge universal Works Department. I earnestly hope, therefore, that the noble Viscount will not press his Amendment and throw us all back again absolutely into the hands of contractors, but that he will allow to remain in the Bill this power, which would be a most salutary and excellent check against any future ring or combination amongst contractors.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01878"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said no one knew better than the noble Earl that they had to perform their work very often under a certain amount of stress. In the Bill before them there had been very little
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0231"/>
<col>449</col>
time between Committee and Report stage, and they had to make the best they could of the time at their disposal. He thought his noble friend had done very wisely in putting his Amendment in its present form, because it raised the point directly whether they were to have a repetition all over the country of the kind of scandals they had been familiar with in works departments nearer home. They on that side of the House were very averse to allowing the country to enter upon any such course. The noble Earl really had no argument to put forward against the Amendment of his noble friend except that he thought there might be a ring of contractors against the Road Board. He did not think there was the least likelihood of any such contingency arising. In many counties, as the noble Viscount had said, contract labour was employed to maintain the roads, and employed with the greatest possible satisfaction, no difficulty having arisen in the matter of rings; and the noble Earl, he thought, forgot that he took power in his own Bill for the Road Board to contract with county councils if they liked to do so. That would be quite a salutary check on any ring that might be formed. He hoped their Lordships would agree that he had completely demolished the one argument put forward by the noble Earl, and that they would accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01879"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> did not know whether the noble Marquess was really of the opinion that there was only one argument against the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01880"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> pointed out that what he had said was that it was the only argument which the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had put forward.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01881"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> said that if the noble Marquess would allow him he would endeavour to put forward two or three others. Assuming that every contractor was perfectly honest and worked for the smallest fraction of profit, he really failed to see why it should be cheaper for the Road Board to do their work through a contractor than to do it themselves. If the Amendment was carried, the Road Board would be unable to lure a single road-sweeper or to direct a road foreman to go and inspect a particular piece of road and report upon its condition. The noble Marquess apparently thought that to insist upon a prohibition of that kind
<col>450</col>
would be a gain to the public. It was a matter of astonishment to him, and he was quite unable to appreciate the point of the noble Marquess's argument. The noble Marquess said that a great many authorities contracted at present for the maintenance of their roads. He was of opinion that the majority of the main roads in the country were now maintained by the county councils direct, and that they found it paid them to do the work themselves. Then they were given the bogey, which they had often heard of, of huge works departments. The noble Marquess had referred them without any details to the scandals which they had heard of nearer home. He did not know exactly what those scandals were; but was it not ordinary common sense to suppose that the Road Board would act precisely as a railway company did when they had large works of construction to carry out&#x2014;namely, that in a case of that kind they would employ a contractor after proper specifications had been prepared and after tenders had been received, and let the contractor carry out the work in the ordinary way in which such work was done by a contractor. But did the noble Marquess consider it necessary that every single piece of road was to be put out to contract, and that the Road Board was not to be able to employ a foreman or repair a particular piece of road and put down stones where necessary except through the intervention of a contractor who was making a profit out of the business? If that was what the noble Marquess wanted, how could anybody conceive that that was going to be a saving to the public and to the Road Board? Directly they came to a question of the Road Board, it seemed to be considered that they were not to be credited even with the ordinary degree of common sense and business ability. Why should it be supposed that the Road Board would adopt the least efficient manner of doing their work? If their Lordships took away the power which the Amendment proposed to take away, it would leave them hampered in many ways quite apart from the operation of rings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01882"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> was bound to support what the noble Lord opposite, Earl Russell, had said, especially on the question of dealing with the abatement of dust. If the money coming to the Road Board was to be used largely in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0232"/>
<col>451</col>
the abatement of dust, it seemed to him that nothing could be better than that there should be a trained squad of men in the employment and under the direction of the Road Board to carry out that work, and those men would be able to go about from county to county and perform their work&#x2014;a work for which they must be specially trained. Surely they ought not to put it beyond the power of the Road Board to carry out their work in their own way without going to a county council or to a contractor? It seemed to him that that would be cutting out a valuable power in the Bill, the lack of which would take away a great deal from the useful character of the Board. He was sorry to find himself once more in opposition to noble Lords on his side of the House, but he trusted that their Lordships would not accept the noble Viscount's Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01883"><member>LORD BRASSEY</member> said that the question of frugality and economic working all depended upon the ability and integrity of the surveyors employed by the Road Board; it was the surveyors upon whom they must rely for prudent and careful administration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01884"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF JERSEY</member> was rather disposed to think that it would be better to give full powers to the authority in a matter like this. He recollected that his own district council used to do the work by contract and then after a good deal of trouble they undertook the roads themselves with a very great saving to the ratepayers, and he believed the wisest course to pursue would be to give the Board as full powers as possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01885"><member>LORD BELPER</member> thought the difficulty had arisen from the words in the clause "themselves to construct and maintain any new roads." What he took it a highway authority should have power to do should be to construct either themselves or through somebody else. If they were going to make a through road he quite agreed that the most convenient way in many cases would be for the Road Board to do it by contract with the local authorities for the part that went through their districts. They would have their staff on the spot and could do it perfectly well. He was not at all sure that doing it through contractors was always a satisfactory way of carrying work out. As far as maintaining roads was concerned, if the Road Board
<col>452</col>
was to be an authority at all they must have some officers under them, and it probably would be cheaper and more reasonable for them to maintain the roads themselves than to hand them over to a contractor. The discussion, he thought, had been very useful, but he was bound to say he rather agreed with his noble friend Lord Jersey that the Road Board should have the widest possible powers either to construct roads themselves or to do the work in any other way; but he would have liked to have seen some other words employed in the Bill to cover that, because the words "themselves to construct" seemed to suggest that they were to do everything themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01886"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member> thought the noble Viscount's Amendment went beyond what he intended, and in view of what had fallen from noble Lords opposite he thought it would be better to keep the words in as they stood in the Bill, because otherwise the Road Board would be practically powerless to employ a proper engineering staff and other necessary officials. It had been suggested that a, central body of the kind would be necessarily expensive, but he thought the example which had been set to them by France controverted that idea. The central body in Paris, which controlled the great national roads of France so well and so economically, had a staff of competent engineers, such as it would be almost absolutely necessary for the Road Board in this country to have, and if the power of constructing and maintaining roads was taken away from them they would be shut out from employing persons of that character. Perhaps it would be wise, however, to adopt the alternative of the noble Lord, Lord Belper, and to say "themselves to construct and maintain any new roads, or to enter into contracts for the construction and maintenance of such roads."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01887"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> suggested that if the word "themselves" were left out it would meet his point, as that would leave it to the Road Board to maintain and construct by contract or otherwise.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01910"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF JERSEY</member> moved to insert words in the same clause providing that the approval of the Treasury of the construction of a new road should not have effect until it was confirmed by Parliament by way of Provisional Order. He pointed out that under the Bill the right of absolute veto had been taken away from the local authority and quite rightly, because that right of veto had been the cause of a good deal of difficulty in the past. His Amendment would not in the least restore the right of veto but it would give the county councils
<col>456</col>
an opportunity of feeling quite sure that its objections had been entertained and considered by the Treasury. One knew when objections were sent in that it was common form on receiving them to say that they had been received and would be duly considered, whether they were considered or not was another matter. Under his Amendment, supposing there happened to be a difference of opinion between the Road Board and the county authority, the Treasury would have to decide between those two, and the Treasury might decide without giving the reasons for their decision. But if an opportunity were given of bringing in a Provisional Order in a case where there was a difference of opinion between the Road Board and a county council, he thought it was then quite certain that the Treasury, before they decided, would be very careful in considering the objections, and probably would see some representatives from the county council on the matter. He quite admitted he did not think as the Bill stood that anything very serious would happen, because they must assume that the road authority would be composed of sound practical men who were not likely to go and force roads upon a district where they were not wanted. At the same time, it was possible that there might be a clashing of opinion between the two bodies, and it would seem to be desirable that the county council, which, after all, did represent the public in the matter, should not be absolutely overruled by the Treasury in the circumstances he had mentioned.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01912"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: At first sight there seems to be a great deal in the noble Earl's Amendment, but perhaps I might be permitted to read a portion of the clause. Subsection (2) runs, "Before the Treasury approve of the construction of a new road by the Road Board they shall consult with the Local Government Board and shall satisfy themselves that notice of the intention to construct the road has been sent by the Road Board to every highway authority in the area of which any part of the proposed
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0235"/>
<col>457</col>
road will be situate, and shall consider any objections to the proposed road which they may receive." I think your Lordships will agree that this seems to be almost enough protection for everybody. The new proposal is, of course, to put the Road Board to the expense, which will be very considerable, as your Lordships know, and the delay of a Provisional Order. As the noble Earl opposite has pointed out, this would only be in a case where the Road Board and the county council disagreed, and where the. Treasury backed up the Road Board in opposition to the county council; but the noble Earl himself said that was a thing that would be very unlikely to happen, and I hope he will not think it necessary to press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01913"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said it did seem to him desirable that the various authorities should be consulted where there was a proposal for a new road, more especially as regarded the expense which might be entailed on the rates in some form or another. He had himself an Amendment on the Paper a little further on very much on the same lines as that of the noble Earl's, which would give power to the various local authorities to lodge objections to a proposed road or to a proposed grant being made on the ground of a great additional burden being thrown upon the rates; and he was bound to say that if the present Amendment were carried, although it did not go quite so far as he was going to ask the House to go, it would meet a serious objection. A disagreement would not very often take place, but occasionally there might be considerable hardships put under the Bill upon local authorities, who might receive a gift in one hand and have to pay out more than they gained with the other. If there were power to have that objection, supposing it was a serious one, brought within the purview of Parliament, he thought that would be a fair way of settling what might in many cases be a very serious objection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01914"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> did not know what steps the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had taken to ascertain the feeling of the great local authorities in respect to the particular provision. Here was a proposal, which in principle their Lordships' House had assented to, that the Road Board should have the right of making roads through any county in England without the consent of the county authority. He wanted their Lordships to recollect that the county
<col>458</col>
councils were very important bodies; they had proved themselves now for many years to be bodies upon whom the greatest reliance could be placed. They did not act obstinately or in any intemperate manner, and were very moderate, judicious, and conciliatory. Further, they were representative of their county; they fulfilled all the canons of democratic government, and were called upon by Parliament to be responsible for the good government and good administration of their counties. He did think, therefore, that they were entitled to a very emphatic voice in every proposed change in their counties, including the provision of roads. There were a certain number of persons who had a conception of great new roads being made in England like the French roads, going through the country from one end to the other. That might be a good thing or it might not be a good thing; but as to the route they were to take and the conditions attaching to them, surely the county councils should have an important voice? They might wish that the roads should pass through certain villages and the Road Board might think otherwise; they might think that there were certain amenities in their county&#x2014;and some counties had great amenities&#x2014;which would be destroyed and public feeling outraged if a particular route were selected. It seemed to him, therefore, that the county councils should have a great voice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01915">What had Parliament done in similar cases? Take the Housing Bill, which had just passed through their Lordships' House. The borough councils were not to be subject to any coercion with regard to town planning under that Bill, and a similar rule ought to apply in this case. In those circumstances some of their Lordships on that side of the House had thought it right to do what he did not think the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had done, and that was to consult, so far as the limited time at their disposal enabled them to do so, the local authorities. Consequently a communication had been sent to the chairman of the highways committee of every county council throughout England and Wales asking him whether, in his opinion, the separate road making authority of the Road Board was a good thing; and, secondly, if he thought it a good thing that power should be given to the Road Board independently of the consent of the county council. Those who made that communication had received a great number of replies.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0236"/>
<col>459</col>
In twenty-seven cases&#x2014;that was to say, from the chairman of the highways committee of twenty-seven English and Welsh counties&#x2014;they had received a reply to the effect either that they objected to this power being vested in the Road Board at all, or that if it was vested in the Road Board it should only be exercised subject to the consent of the county council. In only eight cases&#x2014;and that was the outside number because some of the answers were not absolutely clearly expressed&#x2014;was the proposal as advocated by His Majesty's Government approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01916">In those circumstances they had behind them a great body of public opinion on the point, and they submitted, therefore, that the Amendment of the noble Earl ought to be inserted. Even if it was granted that the county council were likely to prove unreasonable, the only power that was asked to be given to them, after all, was merely that they should have an opportunity of appealing from the Road Board to Parliament. That was the general policy which their Lordships pursued in the Amendments they inserted in the Housing and Town Planning Bill&#x2014;namely, that when dealing with important authorities they should be given the power of an appeal to Parliament itself. That was all that the Amendment of the noble Earl proposed. Such a power was not in the least likely to be exercised unreasonably. It was only likely to be exercised in important cases, because the Road Board and the county council would probably be perfectly sensible bodies, and they would come to an agreement immediately. But in the very rare case where there was a decided difference of opinion, then, and then only, these important authorities in relation to this matter would have a right to come to their Lordships' House on an appeal from the Road Board.</p>

In addition he would point out that it was very unlikely that great trunk roads, say from London to Edinburgh, would be made in preference to short pieces of road round towns and villages, because, to begin with, the funds at the disposal of the Road Board were absolutely inadequate for any such purpose. Secondly, it would be the policy of the Road Board not to make any new roads out of funds provided by one small class of traffic only. He saw no reason whatever why the county councils should not be consulted in the matter; he thought that was the right thing to do, because they had done a great and good work in the past towards fitting the roads for the new traffic that was now in the habit of using them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01919"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he merely wished to disavow that he had any mandate or power to speak on behalf of the county councils.

If they asked any authority whether they would like to have additional power conferred upon them, the chances were that the answer would be "Yes." Everyone must agree that local authorities and county councils must and should be consulted. It was also clear that the proposal, should it unfortunately happen that there was a difference of opinion, must necessarily add very largely to the expense. He did not know whether a county council would have a <i>locus standi</i> if it was proposed to place a railway track through their county.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01922"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> said he was not sure whether they would or not, but the case was very similar, because a road had to go through their county for the purposes of traffic. If a county council could compel the Road Board to go to Parliament, he did not know whether the Treasury would back up the Board or not. There was a good deal to be said against having appeals to Parliament in all these cases unless there was some real necessity. It they had a body in whom they had confidence&#x2014;they had not got the names of the Commissioners yet, although the noble Marquess had asked for them&#x2014;surely they ought to leave to them the arrangement of these concerns, subject to all the checks which already existed in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01923"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> did not quite agree with the doctrine just laid down, that if they had confidence in the Board which would be appointed by His Majesty's Government, that Board was to be allowed to over-ride all representative governments on the particular question referred to it. Surely that was an extraordinary doctrine. They might have confidence in the Board without wishing to do away altogether with Parliamentary and local representation. As to railways, he, was under the impression, although he might be wrong, that a county council would have a <i>locus standi</i>, but whether they had or not, there was a great difference between the two cases. A county council was not the railway authority for a county, but it was the highway authority, and one of the strongest speeches in favour of the Amendment was that delivered by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, who pointed out that this sort of case would be very unlikely to arise. Therefore this proposition was, as had been said, almost academic; but the noble Earl also pointed out that when the Road Board had come to a decision there was under this Bill no appeal whatever against it. That was surely a very undesirable thing. He agreed that if they were asking that every urban district authority or parish council should be able to compel the Road Board to go for a Provisional Order, such a proposal might reasonably be objected to; but the case put in the Amendment was that of a whole county, as represented by the county council, rejecting the proposition of the Road Board. Surely they should have an opportunity of coming before Parliament. The fact that such a case would be rare

Even if you put in the word "improvement," it would be better to leave the Bill with the same language as in Clause 5, subclause (1), which defines the conditions under which an application for an order may be made. The Commissioners are clearly the proper persons to determine whether the land is absolutely necessary or not, and I hope that in the interests of the Bill my noble friend will not press this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01938"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved to insert in Clause 11 a new subsection providing that where, by the approval of the Treasury of the construction of a new road, any property was increased in value the Road Board or the highway authority, as the case may be, "shall be entitled to recover from any person whose property is so increased in value such
<col>464</col>
proportion of the expenditure of the Road. Board or the highway authority, as the case may be, as failing agreement in the opinion of an arbitrator, such person should pay, having regard to the improvement in the value of such property."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01939">Their Lordships would remember that when this Bill was last under consideration there was a discussion rather late at night over an Amendment relating to what they knew as the strips of land on either side of the road. It was proposed by His Majesty's Government that the Road Board should not only have authority to buy land compulsorily for a roadway, but also to buy strips of land on either side. When that part of the Government's proposal was under discussion and one of his noble friends moved to leave out the latter power, the noble Earl the Leader of the House taunted them with being most impracticable people, who would never agree to make provision for any form of betterment or recoupment in return for an expenditure of public money which was likely to improve the value of property. He could not compliment His Majesty's Government upon their efforts to solve this very difficult question. In the Housing Bill they made a proposal which nobody, not even themselves, could defend, by which the whole of the profit which might arise after an improvement was to go to the local authority. On the same principle, if one man made a road to another man's mine, and gave access to it, he ought to have the whole value of what was got from the mine handed over to him. That proposal of His Majesty's Government was, however, rejected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01940">When they came to deal with the Development Bill, the Government thought they would try their hand again, and they attempted a totally different proposal, which was called recoupment. They proposed that the Road Board should have power to purchase compulsorily these enormous strips of land. The Government did not seem to think that there was any objection to allowing the Road Board to be a land speculator on a large scale. They thought that the experience which local authorities had had from this device was so encouraging that they might follow it in this case. One of the most disastrous failures of this principle was to be seen in London. Their Lordships had only to walk down Kingsway to see what was the result of this effort to buy strips of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0239"/>
<col>465</col>
land on either side of a road for recoupment. It had cost the London ratepayers enormous sums annually, and the difficulty did not appear ever likely to be solved. Their Lordships very wisely refused to allow the Road Board to enter upon any such wild-cat speculation as buying these strips would have involved, and that was cut out of the Bill. But the noble Earl the Leader of the House complained that they had made no proposals to meet the difficulty. Here was public money being expended which might enhance the value of property, and they made no proposals, either by way of recoupment or betterment, to make good to the spending authorities the cost to which they had been put. That taunt he (Lord Salisbury) was now doing his best to meet.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-01941">The Amendment seemed rather formidable, but when he told their Lordships that it had already been discussed at very great length a few days ago in that House they would not be terrified. It was exactly the same proposal, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, as that put into the Housing Bill&#x2014;that was to say, they proposed that the expenditure of public money where it improved property should be met, as far as the out-of-pocket expenses of the Road Board were concerned, by contributions from the landowners whose property had been enhanced in value. That appeared to be a perfectly fair proposal, and it should be borne in mind that the public would be the gainers by the increased rateable value which would be caused by the improvement. <i>Ex hypothesi</i> the property was to be improved in value, otherwise there would be no betterment. The rateable value would rise, and therefore in exact proportion as the landowner benefited so the public would benefit. To use a common expression, the landowner and the rating authority would be in the same boat. If they added to that increased value the out-of-pocket expenses which the public authority was to be reimbursed to the extent to which it improved the land, then it appeared to him they had covered all the reasonable claims which the public might make in a matter of this kind. He did not pretend that in a matter so subtle and so difficult as betterment his humble effort was perfection. He was very diffident about it, and he knew it was open to a good deal of question. All he could say of it was that it was far better than either of the two plans which His Majesty's Government
<col>466</col>
had proposed. Neither of them would hold water, and therefore, to use an old phrase, the plan he submitted held the field. It had already been sanctioned by their Lordships' House in a very important Bill, and he thought that was sufficient ground for hoping it would be sanctioned a second time in the Development Bill.</p>

That was by way of betterment, or to prevent the landowners obtaining the benefit of the new Toad without paying anything for it. But there was no such provision with regard to roads made by highway authorities, and so far as they were concerned the landowners were allowed to take the whole benefit. The noble Marquess had suggested a great improvement in the Bill from the point of view of the Government by extending the betterment to the highway authorities as well.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01953"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> moved the insertion, after Clause 18, of a new clause with the object of giving power to rating authorities to offer objections to new schemes on the ground that those schemes would place a burden on their rates. He said that this Amendment to some extent covered the same ground as the Amendment proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Jersey. It was difficult to sketch out in exact detail how this extra burden would always be laid upon the rates. Sometimes a burden might directly or indirectly be laid upon the rates. Clause 1 of the Bill contained very wide powers. It enabled advances to be made to "a public authority, university, college, school, or institution, or an association of persons," any of whom might be concerned with rates already levied by a county council or some other rating authority. It was quite possible that a gift of money might be made to an authority on the one hand, but
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0241"/>
<col>469</col>
the authority might lose upon the other. The authority might have more expense in upkeep than they would gain in the way of improvement. He did not know whether His Majesty's Government thought the Amendment went too far in taking in all rating authorities, and whether they would consent to its being applied only to a county council area. He might give one instance where a burden might be placed upon the rates. A giant of money might be made to a new harbour upon the sea coast. That undertaking was of a speculative nature, and should the harbour turn out to be a failure, it might depreciate the rateable value of the area surrounding it. In that case the burden would fall upon the rates, and he thought the Amendment worthy of the consideration of their Lordships.</p>

They would see by the early part of Clause 19 that it was prescribed that in the case of an order being made by the Development Commissioners for the acquisition of land that formed part of a common or open space, it should be provisional only, and was not
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0242"/>
<col>471</col>
to have effect without an Order in Parliament. His noble friend Lord Meath was of opinion, and he agreed with him, that no change should be made in the policy of the Bill as set out in the earlier part of this clause because it was clearly an interference with commons. It might be interfering with the general use of a common by people who had heretofore used it and enjoyed it. Why should this particular method of interfering with commons be made an exception from the general rule laid down requiring Parliamentary sanction? It might be that the making of a new road would be a valuable improvement and might be a great convenience, but it required grave consideration, because it might interfere with the use and the amenity of commons.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-01999"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> appealed to the Government, before the Bill was read a third time, to give the House one bit of very important information. He quite saw that it might be difficult for them to give their Lordships the names of the whole of the Development Commissioners, but he thought they ought to have some information on the subject. The Development Commissioners and the Road Board were going to be very important bodies, and if their Lordships read this Bill a third time without ascertaining the names of the Commissioners, or, at any rate, the chairman and the vice-chairman of the Road Board, they would have no other opportunity of getting the information from the Government. He pleaded especially in the case of the Road Board to the Government to let them know whom they proposed to appoint chairman and vice-chairman. It was a matter of vital interest to a great many people to know that, and it was a piece of public information that the Government ought to give at this stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02000"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I very much wish that I could meet my noble friend's desires on this point, but I have had no information given to me upon it, and therefore I am unable to say anything definite. But I hope my noble friend will not stop the Third Reading on that account. I am certain that the names of the Commissioners will be announced as soon as possible, but I must again urge that these Commissioners ought not to be appointed in a hurry, as if the wrong people were appointed through any insistence great damage to the Bill might ensue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02001"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> thought their Lordships would be far from satisfied with the reply of the noble Earl. There had been no hurry in this matter on the part of His Majesty's Government. It was a long time since the Chancellor of the Exchequer made known to the public generally the provisions of this Bill in bringing in the Budget, and it was some time since the Development Bill was laid before the House of Commons.
<col>476</col>
They had asked more than once for some information with regard to the composition of these important bodies, and they had had nothing but the noble Earl's very courteous replies that he was afraid he could not say anything at the time, but that he hoped to be able to say something some time or other. This Bill would return to another place, and perhaps in a fortnight hence or more their Lordships might be asked to consider the provisions of the Bill again. Surely by that time, at any rate, His Majesty's Government would be able to put Parliament and the public in possession of the names of those whom they intended to appoint on these important boards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02002"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so far as the present and past actions of the Government are concerned, I think noble Lords have no just grounds of complaints. Noble Lords will remember what happened. It was suggested, and was strongly pressed by the noble Viscount opposite, that the Commission should assume an entirely different character from that which we intended it should assume, by having the Road Board amalgamated with it. That proposal, I am glad to think, was not adopted by your Lordships' House, but it might have been, and what would have happened afterwards when the matter came up for discussion as between the two Houses of Parliament it is impossible to say. But I think noble Lords will agree that in those circumstances it would have been difficult for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to offer to certain gentlemen an appointment of the ultimate nature of which he could not himself be certain. As regards the further request of the noble Viscount, we will, of course, convey it to my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I shall be glad myself if it is possible to meet the wishes of noble Lords opposite, although I cannot profess to be sufficiently acquainted with all the circumstances of the case to say whether it may be possible by the time the Bill comes back to us for the names to be announced.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02004"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said, with regard to the Schedule, that the noble Earl had that evening inserted an Amendment providing that notice of an order should be given to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Surely a similar notice ought to be given to the Lord of the Manor and the copyholders, who were
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0245"/>
<col>477</col>
interested in the commons. If it was difficult to get at the copyholders, as he believed it was sometimes, notice should be given to the steward of the manor. He did not know whether these would be included in the owners, lessees, and occupiers of the land, as mentioned in the Schedule; but, if not, he proposed an Amendment to the noble Earl's Amendment so that it would read as follows: "And in the case of land forming part of a common, open space, or allotment, also the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and to the Lord of the Manor and copyholders."</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02018"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> drew attention to subclause (2) of Clause 2, dealing with the manner of administration of oaths. He said that it read, "Provided that in the case of a person who is not a Christian the oath shall be administered as nearly as may be in the form and manner aforesaid, but with such modifications of the words or ceremony as may make the same conformable to the religious faith, or binding on the conscience of such persons." How that was to be found out he really did not know. How was anybody in a County Court or any other Court to find out what was "conformable to the religious faith or binding on the conscience" of a Parsee or an Arab? He asked whether it would not be better to say that in the case of a non-Christian they should be allowed to administer the oath in the way it was now administered with regard to any Christian? They had the uplifted hand, and the Testament, and the use of the words "I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give to the Court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." He moved to insert words to provide that the oath should be administered to a non-Christian witness "in any manner which is now lawful."</p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02025"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: As we have read the Development Bill a third time I understand that the noble Earl the Leader of the House will not desire that we should sit to-morrow. Perhaps he will answer that question, and possibly also give us some idea of the business which will come before the House when we reassemble after the adjournment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02026"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as we have fortunately been able to finish the Development Bill to-day I am able, with the concurrence of noble Lords opposite, to carry out the plan which I indicated on a former occasion&#x2014;namely, that we should adjourn for a few days at the close of this sitting. As regards the day on which we should resume and the business to be taken on that day, I desire to consult the convenience of noble Lords opposite. I should propose to take the London Elections Bill either on the first day of meeting or a day or two later, whichever would best suit noble Lords. By the end of next week the Amendments both to the Housing and Town Planning Bill and the Irish Land Bill will. I understand, have been considered in another place, so that we should be in a position to consider any Amendments in the course of the week when we meet. Perhaps the noble Marquess could give me some indication as to the date on which he thinks it would be most convenient for us to resume. On the former occasion
<col>480</col>
I mentioned the 8th. I do not know whether the noble Marquess would desire to adhere to that, or whether in his opinion the state of business would admit of our adjourning to as late as the 10th.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02027"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think we are, upon the whole, inclined to suggest that we should reassemble on the 8th, and we see no objection to the noble Earl's proposal that the London Elections Bill should be the first business to come before us after the adjournment. With regard to subsequent business, perhaps it would be hardly possible for us at this moment to give any opinion without knowing what the fate of the measures to which the noble Earl has referred is likely to be in the House of Commons. I understand from the noble Earl that he expects the Housing and Town Planning Bill and the Irish Land Bill to be taken by the House of Commons next week?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02028"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I understand that the Housing and Town Planning Bill is likely to be taken on Monday. I am not quite certain about the Irish Land Bill, but I understand the Housing Bill is, at any rate, to be taken on Monday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02029"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Then I think it will be for His Majesty's Government to put those measures down upon whatever date they think suitable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02030"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I shall be happy to fall in with the suggestion of the noble Marquess, and we will therefore, if noble Lords opposite agree, adjourn till Monday the 8th of November, and take the London Elections Bill on that day.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02062"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to subsection (4) of Clause 2&#x2014;
<quote>(4) Where an established officer or servant of an asylum is injured&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>)in the actual discharge of his duty; and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) without his own default; and</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) by some injury specifically attributable to the nature of his duty and is permanently incapacitated for asylum duties as the result of such injury;</li>

the visiting committee of such asylum may grant to him such gratuity or special superannuation allowance as they may consider reasonable:</quote>
<quote>Provided that a superannuation allowance shall not in any case exceed two-thirds of the salary or wages and emoluments of the superannuated person.</quote>
The Amendment was to insert, after the words "(<i>c</i>) by some injury, "the words "or illness." He understood that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill (Lord Monk Bretton) accepted this Amendment, and therefore he would not detain the House by explaining it. But there was a consequential Amendment arising out of this&#x2014;namely, to insert, after the words "Where an established officer or servant of an asylum is injured," the words "or is incapacitated." He would first move the consequential Amendment.</p>

<col>484</col>
having discovered a consequential Amendment which preceded the one on the Paper. It was worthy of the country to which the noble Earl belonged. This, however, was not an Amendment to which the Home Office could give their assent. In giving power to visiting committees to award superannuation in cases of incapacity a special concession had been made, and it might burden the rates considerably if the power were also given in cases of illness, In a great many instances it would be difficult, if not impossible, to decide whether the illness was specifically attributable to the nature of the duties, and in those circumstances a great many disappointments and disputes would arise. He thought their Lordships had dealt very liberally with asylum officers in this Bill, and he hoped the further concession proposed by the noble Earl would not be made.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02079"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON,</member> on behalf of the promoters of the Bill, supported the Amendment, and expressed the hope that, as the provision would be permissive and as he believed it emanated from Government sources, the noble Earl the Lord Steward would see his way to accept it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02080"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said His Majesty's Government had no objection to the first part of the Amendment. But in paragraph (<i>c</i>) the noble Viscount had somewhat arbitrarily fixed the period of ten years. It seemed to him (Earl Beauchamp) that if a concession of this kind were to be given to asylum officers it would be fair to give it after ten years rather than before the completion of that period of service. That, however, was not the point he wished to press. The paragraph would create a precedent with regard to superannuation allowances, and in those circumstances the Home Office were unwilling to agree to it. Nothing of this kind existed in connection with pensions in the public service, and it was not thought desirable to introduce it here.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02081"><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member> said that after the noble Earl's statement he would withdraw paragraph (<i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02082"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> pointed out that paragraph (<i>b</i>) introduced a new element into the clause. In addition to a gratuity it would permit an annual allowance to be given. He did not like the term "annual allowance." It was difficult to distinguish between an annual allowance and a pension, and it seemed quite possible under the Amendment to give to a widow an actual pension for the rest of her life. He would, therefore, move to amend the Amendment by omitting from paragraph (<i>b</i>) the words "an annual allowance or."</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02090"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said there still remained the proviso at the end of the noble Viscount's Amendment, and as paragraph (<i>c</i>) had been deleted he suggested that the proviso should be amended by omitting the words "subsections (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of" and inserting the word "under." It would then read "Provided that a gratuity under this clause." The words "a gratuity granted under subsection (<i>c</i>) of this clause shall not exceed his total contributions" were also now unnecessary and should be deleted.</p>

All services by an established officer or servant in an asylum shall be aggregated and reckoned for the purposes of this Act, whether the services have been continuous or not, and whether they have been rendered at one or more asylums: Provided that no service which is not continuous for at least two years shall be so reckoned,</quote>
by inserting in the proviso, after the word "years," the words "under one local

He said their Lordships would remember that the clause was amended on the motion of Lord Belper by the insertion of a provision that no service should be reckoned as continuous in any asylum which did not come up to two years. Some local authorities had several asylums, and an officer might be transferred every six months or every year from one asylum to another. He was sure Lord Belper did not intend his Amendment to affect such a man, and the insertion of the words "under one local authority" would prevent any hardship occurring.</p>

<quote>10. (1) An established officer or servant who has not become entitled to a superannuation allowance, and who loses his office or employment by reason of reduction of staff, or of any other cause whatever other than his own misconduct or voluntary resignation, shall be entitled to receive the aggregate amount of his contributions under this Act.</quote>
<quote>(2) The visiting committee of an asylum may, if they think fit, repay to any female officer or servant leaving to be married after not Jess than three years service, the amount of her contributions under this Act, provided that within three months after leaving she produces to the visiting committee her marriage certificate.</quote>

The Amendments were confined to subsection (3), and were designed to make the subsection read&#x2014;

Act, unless, upon obtaining such fresh office or employment he repays the amount so received to the visiting committee from whom he received them.</quote>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02107"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> moved to amend Clause 11&#x2014;
<quote>11. When an established officer or servant of the first class has attained the age of fifty-live, or an established officer or servant of the second class has attained the age of sixty, and the visiting committee of the asylum in which he is employed are of opinion that his retirement would be expedient in the interests of the service, it shall be competent for them to require him to retire upon payment to him of the superannuation allowance to which he may be entitled under this Act:</quote>
<quote>Provided that nothing in this section shall prejudice the existing right of any visiting committee to dismiss any officer or servant employed in an asylum, or to reduce him to a lower rate of pay, or shall prevent his claim to a superannuation allowance from being refused in any case where under this Act a claim to superannuation allowance is forfeited,</quote>
by inserting, after the words "it shall be competent for them," the words "with the consent of the Secretary of State." He said the clause gave power to the local authority compulsorily to retire any officer of the first class at the age of fifty-five. He proposed to modify that power by moving to insert words providing that the order of the local authority should be approved by the Secretary of State, and, according to the interpretation, in Ireland the Secretary of State meant the Lord Lieutenant. This was a provision which particularly concerned the administration in Ireland. Some of the officers there were appointed by the Lord Lieutenant previous to the Local Government Act, and might
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0252"/>
<col>491</col>
not be so acceptable to the present authorities. He was also told that religious differences entered into these matters in Ireland, and he therefore hoped the Government would accept the Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02109"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the Government could not accept the Amendment. There was nothing in this Amendment which limited it to Ireland; it would apply to every local authority throughout the country. Ministers had duties enough to discharge without being obliged to hold an inquiry into the case of every officer which the visiting committee of an asylum thought it well compulsorily to retire at the age of fifty-five. In his opinion they might fairly trust the local authority in such a matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02110"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> thought there was something to be said for the case of Ireland, and if the noble Earl would allow him he would put down an Amendment on the point for Third Reading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02111"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> admitted the force of what the Lord Steward had said, but thought some Amendment of the kind was necessary to safeguard the interests of such officials in Ireland, as a man might be compulsorily retired for no other reason than that he had become unpopular.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02112"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>, in whose name a similar Amendment stood on the Paper, said this right of appeal existed in Ireland now, and all they desired was to safeguard an existing right.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02114"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> moved to insert in Clause 12 the following proviso:&#x2014;"Provided that every superannuation allowance or gratuity under this Act shall be paid out of the fund out of which the salary or wages and emoluments of the officer or servant is or has been paid." He said the effect of the clause would be that all the allowances mentioned therein would be borne out of the visiting committees' maintenance fund, from which the cost of feeding, clothing, and maintenance of patients was paid. Repairs were carried out by the visiting committee
<col>492</col>
and the cost was subsequently recovered from the county rate. This cost included the wages of such men as were employed on repairs work, and he was told that in the London asylums and in some of the county asylums as well there was a considerable established permanent staff employed in carrying out these repairs. It was thought that all these officials, if the visiting committees included them in the necessary regulations, would come under the clause, and the London County Council, on whose behalf he moved this Amendment, felt that it was desirable that the fund from which the wages of the men came should be the fund from which the superannuation should come also.</p>

<quote>13. Where an officer or servant has been employed in a poor law asylum prior to or subsequent to his employment as au established officer or servant to which this Act applies, he shall, at the discretion of the managers or authority, be entitled to reckon his entire period of employment or service in both capacities for the purpose of pension on the scale and subject to the statutory requirements affecting pensions in the service from which he last retires.</quote>
He explained that this clause was inserted in Committee on the motion of Lord Donoughmore. Its object was to make asylum service for pension purposes interchangeable with Poor Law service. The noble Earl, in moving the clause, laid special stress upon the importance of bringing the Metropolitan Asylums Board into the Bill, and he thought it was chiefly with that object that the clause was inserted. The clause, however, considerably complicated the Bill. The promoters of the Bill would have been quite willing to accept the clause if it were workable, but it was objected to by the Local Government Board and was certainly
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0253"/>
<col>493</col>
outside the principle of the Bill, which was that asylums officers had a very difficult and dangerous service and should receive special treatment, whereas Poor Law officers did not come within that category. He had a number of Amendments on the Paper to bring the Metropolitan Asylums Board within the scope of the Bill, and he therefore hoped the noble Earl would agree to the deletion of the clause.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02125"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to Clause 16. The clause ran&#x2014;
<quote>16. The salary or wages and emoluments of an established officer or servant shall, for the purpose of computing the amount of a superannuation allowance or gratuity, be calculated according to the average amount of his salary or wages and emoluments during the ten years ending on the quarter day which immediately precedes the day on which he ceases to hold his office or employment, or, in the case of an officer or servant with less than ten years service, on the average amount during his whole period of service; and the expression "emoluments" includes all fees, poundage and other payments made to any established officer or servant as such for his own use, and also the money value any apartments, rations, or other allowances in kind appertaining to his office or employment.</quote>
<quote>The annual money value of all such fees, poundage and other payments, apartments, rations, or other allowance in kind shall be set out in a schedule to be prepared by the visiting committee of every asylum and affixed in a conspicuous place in the asylum.</quote>
He moved to leave out the words "ten
<col>494</col>
years" in both cases where they occurred and to substitute the words "five years." The object of the Amendment was to restore the Bill to the shape in which it left the Select Committee in another place, and he asked their Lordships to reconsider the matter because a very important point was involved. If the clause remained as it now stood with the period at ten years, asylum officers, who had very special duties and very special dangers, would be placed in a worse position than Poor Law officers, whose pensions were calculated on a five year basis and whose calling was nothing like as difficult or dangerous as that of those to whom this Bill applied. The case for this Amendment was stated by Mr. Byrne on behalf of the Home Office in his evidence before the Select Committee. Mr. Byrne said&#x2014;
<quote>" We should suggest that, as in the Poor Law Officers' Superannuation Act, computation should be made on the average salary for the last live years. &#x2026; As the rest of the Bill is based on the Poor Law Officers Act, we think that those officers should be pensionable on the average of the last five years."</quote>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02127"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> hoped the Amendment would not be accepted. Considering the small amount which these officers would contribute towards the pension it was not unfair to them to take the calculation on a ten years basis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02128"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> said he opposed this Amendment in Committee and must oppose it again on the score of economy. The Government were not proposing to give any grants in respect of asylum workers, as were given in the case of the police.

To those members of your Lordships' House who have contested Parliamentary elections the term "successive occupation" is no doubt a very familiar one, but as the majority of the members of this House have not had that experience, I may, perhaps, be allowed to explain what the expression "successive occupation" means. It is this. Where a voter in a Parliamentary borough changes his residence to another part of the borough, even although that part is situated in a different Parliamentary constituency or division, he retains his vote; but in London when a man changes his residence from one Parliamentary division to another or from one borough to another, he loses his vote. Say, for example, that a man changes his residence from Dover-street to Jermyn-street or from Bond-street to Piccadilly; he then loses his vote for at least one year and possibly even for nearly two years, according to the time when the removal is effected. And this brings about this very curious anomaly, that a man when he changes his residence, while retaining his vote for county council elections, borough council elections, and guardians elections, yet loses it for Parliamentary elections. Surely, my Lords, it is really an absurd and wholly indefensible thing to say to a man that he shall retain his vote for borough council, county council, and other elections, while he loses his vote for Parliamentary elections, and it is this really extraordinary anomaly which this Bill seeks to rectify.<lb/>
Let me take the example of what takes place in another great city. I will take the case of Liverpool with which the noble Earl opposite. Lord Derby, is much more familiar than myself. In Liverpool there are nine divisions&#x2014;Kirkdale, Walton Everton, West Derby, Scotland, Exchange,
<col>498</col>
Abercromby, East Toxteth, and West Toxteth. A man can change his residence as often as he pleases in any of those divisions, and he yet retains his Parliamentary vote. London is divided into twenty-eight different boroughs, and a man by changing his residence will lose his Parliamentary vote for from one to two years. The object of this Bill is to make the law practically the same in London in this respect as it is in Liverpool. Therefore, I think it will be admitted that there is really no startlingly novel proposal in the principle of this Bill, and I do not think any member of this House, however much he may dislike His Majesty's present Government, will be able to detect even a taint of Socialism or the germs of revolution within the four-corners of this very modest measure. For really what it does is to bring London into line with the other great cities of this country with regard to this matter of successive occupation.<lb/>
We have been charged elsewhere with an attempt to gerrymander the London constituencies in favour of the Liberal Party. [Ironical cheers.] I am grateful to noble Lords opposite for their kindly encouragement. But I hope I may be believed by some members of this House when I say that that is not the case; that the object of this Bill is, as I have stated it, to remove disabilities with regard to this matter of occupation which the electors of London, and practically of London alone of our great cities, suffer under at the present time. There are one or two other arguments which I would like to cite as showing that a measure of this kind is really due to London. In the first place, one has to consider that a large proportion of the London population is a migratory population. I am told removals amount in some Parliamentary divisions to as much as thirty per cent. of the population. In 1908 the revision of the lists in Camberwell revealed the fact that in Camberwell in 44,000 separately assessed hereditaments there were 32,000 cases of removal. I do not say they were all cases of removal from that particular Parliamentary division, but I quote it to show that the population of many Parliamentary divisions in London is largely migratory in its character. There is also this fact to consider, that the proportion of voters in the metropolis as compared with the population is less than that in the rest of the country. On the 1907 register the proportion of voters to population in London was 144 per thousand. For the rest of the United
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0256"/>
<col>499</col>
Kingdom it was 176 per thousand. I think these figures show that very disadvantageous treatment is meted out to London under the present system of registration.<lb/>
This injustice&#x2014;for it really, to my mind, is an injustice&#x2014;we propose to remedy under Clause 1 of this Bill by creating London a Parliamentary borough. Were that to take place it would have these two very important effects. In the first place, elections in London would take place on the same day; and, secondly, the number of plural voters in and around London would be very greatly reduced. First of all, with regard to holding elections on the same day, that is already the law with regard to municipal elections; it has been found, I understand, to work well, and I submit that holding Parliamentary elections on the same day would result in less confusion and less dislocation of trade than the practice which obtains at present of holding those elections on different or on successive days. There are somewhere about 800,000 voters on the register of the London County Council. There are some 600,000 on the register of the Parliamentary divisions of a corresponding area. The London County Council elections are all held on the same day and no inconvenience arises from it, and therefore I think it is fair to conclude that the same practice would be equally convenient for Parliamentary elections.<lb/>
Now with regard to plural voting, this Bill would, of course, restrict the plural voting powers of persons residing in London. But I would ask the House to note this fact. I do not use it as an argument for the Bill, but I want to put quite frankly before the House what the effect of the operation of the Bill will be. Whilst restricting, as I say, the plural voting power of persons residing in London, the operations of this Bill will allow a considerable number of persons living outside London but having qualifying premises in London to obtain the right to vote in London which they have not hitherto possessed. That comes about in this way. In order to be registered as the occupier of an office in a Parliamentary borough it is necessary for a man to reside with in seven miles of that borough. Thus, I will take the case of the Strand. In order to vote for business premises or an office in the Strand, the voter must reside within seven miles of the Strand. If, as would be the case under this Bill, the division of the Strand were merged into the much larger
<col>500</col>
Parliamentary borough of London, then the distance of seven miles would be measured from the new boundary of the Parliamentary borough of London, and therefore that would include a large area which is not included at the present time. Take the case of a person living, for example, in Richmond who has also business premises in the Strand. At present he has not a vote in respect of his business premises in the Strand, but if this Bill were to pass he would have an additional vote for the reason which I have just stated.<lb/>
While I am on the subject of plural voting, I should like to quote what the late Mr. Gladstone, speaking some seventeen years ago in the city of London, said on this subject. He used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The case of London is a very peculiar case. No place suffers as London Buffers from the defective state of the law. It suffers more than any other place from plural voting. The constituencies of the metropolis are bloated on the one hand and starved on the other; bloated by the plural vote and starved by the fact that successive occupation does not run throughout the whole area of London."</quote>
We all know that in these days many noble Lords opposite and even many noble Lords on the Cross Benches, profess a high regard for the authority of Mr. Gladstone. May I suggest that they will have an opportunity of proving it this evening. We may also be told by noble Lords opposite that what this Bill proposes to do can be done, or ought to be done, in a Redistribution Bill. I hope I have shown to the House&#x2014;I have done my best to do so&#x2014;what a very serious anomaly does already exist in this matter of successive occupation in London, and for my part I cannot understand the frame of mind which admits of the existence of an anomaly, but yet which refuses to remedy that particular anomaly because it is impossible for the moment to remedy other anomalies which we also know to exist elsewhere.<lb/>
As the principle of this Rill is contained in Clause 1, I do not think it is necessary for me, at any rate now, to go further into details or attempt an explanation of the other clauses of the measure. And I am not encouraged to do so by observing on the Notice Paper that a Motion for the rejection of the Bill stands in the name of a noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite. I think I might be entitled to use an argument which is sometimes used against us, when it suits them, by
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0257"/>
<col>501</col>
noble Lords opposite with regard to the Division Lists of another place. I might point to the fact that only fifty-one members of the House of Commons were found to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill, and only twenty-nine against the Third Reading; or I might endeavour to emulate an example that was set during the debates on the Irish Land Bill by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, who in an eloquent speech on the subject of congestion pleaded for the long line of congests waiting at the door of this House for relief from their unhappy plight. I think I, too, may be entitled to plead for the long line of London electors, thousands of them, waiting at the door of this House in expectation of relief from the disability with regard to the franchise under which they suffer at present through no fault of their own.<lb/>
But I fear that arguments from this side of the House will be of little avail, and that this measure, so modest in its scope and moderate in its provisions, will share the fate of many other Liberal measures, and will shortly be done to death by noble Lords opposite, and we on this side are Powerless to do more than register our protest against this proceeding. But before I sit down I must say this. I regret to notice that a Motion for the rejection of this Bill stands in the name of the noble Earl opposite, Lord Derby, a representative in this House of a family connected, if I may say so with all sincerity, by long and honourable traditions with the great city of Liverpool, for in putting an end to this Bill he will deny to the electors of the metropolis that privilege which the electors of the city of Liverpool already enjoy; and I would like to ask him just one question. I have no right to ask him a question, but perhaps during the course of his remarks he will be so courteous as to give me an answer. Would he approve of a man who changed his residence from, say, the Everton district in Liverpool to the West Derby division losing his vote for eighteen months or two years for doing so, and, if not, why does he refuse this privilege&#x2014;it is not a privilege it is a right&#x2014;why does he refuse this right to the electors of London? I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

notice, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move that the Bill be read 2<sup>a</sup> this day three months, said: My Lords, I shall not detain your Lordships long in moving the Amendment that stands in my name, and that for several reasons. In the first place, the noble Lord who has introduced the Bill has left it already in what I might call a dying condition, as he has evidently, perhaps rightly, forecasted its early demise. In the second place the arguments that apply as against this Bill are already well known to your Lordships, because it will probably be within your Lordships' recollection that about three years ago my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn in this House moved the rejection of the Plural Voting Bill. He did so in what was known as a reasoned Amendment, asking your Lordships to reject the Bill because it was piecemeal legislation, because it destroyed ancient landmarks, because it altered the compromise arrived at between the two great Parties in 1885 with regard to the franchise of this country, and because it at the same time was not accompanied by a redistribution of seats. I hold that every word that applied to the Plural Voting Bill applies with redoubled force to the Bill now before your Lordships' House, because while that was piecemeal legislation, this is only a fragmentary piece of piecemeal legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02149">I shall follow the noble Lord's example and not go into any of the details of the Bill. I shall deal only with the principle; and as I believe in your Lordships' House, as in another place, the principle is dealt with on the Second Reading, and only the principle, I hope I shall be in order in confining myself to that. Now what is the ostensible object of this Bill? The ostensible object of the Bill is to make it easy for a man who changes his residence to take, so to speak, his vote with him&#x2014;that his vote should be part of his household furniture, and that wherever he goes that vote should go with him; and it is held that there is especially in London an injustice owing to the great number of changes that undoubtedly take place in residence during the course of a year. I dare say there is a bigger proportion of changes of residences in London than in other parts of the country, but I doubt whether it is so very large as some noble Lords may think. I therefore hold, although I quite agree that there may be
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0258"/>
<col>503</col>
a hardship in London, that it is also a hardship which applies with equal force all over the country; and if the only question was to do away with that period of disfranchisement which is said to exist for two years&#x2014;I never could make out how that calculation is arrived at&#x2014;if that is the ostensible reason, if that is the real reason for bringing in this Bill, it could easily be remedied by a one-clause measure applicable all over the country, and which I venture to think your Lordships would be only too willing to accept. But that is not the real reason.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02150">The noble Lord who introduced the Bill was frank enough to tell us that the real reason was to do away with plural voting in London. It is the Plural Voting Bill which was intended for the whole of the country and which was rejected by your Lordships' House made applicable only to London. The noble Lord in introducing this Bill spoke of it all through as an enfranchising Bill, as a Bill for giving votes. He absolutely ignored the fact that while you are giving votes, while you are allowing the easy transfer of votes to men who are continually changing their residences and who may be looked upon, perhaps, as having the least interest in the constituency in which they live, the Bill at the same time disfranchises thousands of voters who, having two residences in the present area of London, are entitled to vote in both places, and can be held, I think rightly, to have more stake in the country than those of the changeable and migratory order. The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, when he spoke against the Plural Voting Bill, referred to the cynical humour of the author of that measure, Mr. Harcourt. The author of that Rill is the author of this Bill, and the cynical humour is just as apparent in this Bill as it was in the other; and it may be a curious coincidence which rather emphasises the humour, that the Second Beading of this Bill was taken in another place immediately after the transfer of a vote in London from Mr. Harcourt's side of the House to the other, and the Second Reading in this House is taken immediately after a similar process also in London. I have no doubt whatever in my own mind that Mr. Harcourt, whose knowledge of Parliamentary organisation is of the kind that what he does not know is not worth knowing, sees in this Bill a chance of getting through, under the guise of making
<col>504</col>
the transfer of votes easy, a Bill which will disfranchise many thousands of those who, perhaps rightly, he holds to belong to the opposite Party to himself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02151">The whole principle of this Bill is contained in the first clause, which makes London one borough. In the words of the noble Lord who introduced the Bill, and who incidentally paid a great compliment to Liverpool and Manchester, it is to bring London in line with Liverpool and Manchester. Now is there any justice in attempting to make of London one borough the same as in the case of the other larger cities of the United Kingdom? Do remember this, that none of those boroughs have ever been anything else but single boroughs. The whole of their Parliamentary existence has been as one borough, which as their population has grown has been gradually divided into more constituencies. On the contrary London has been diametrically opposite. London has always been from the very outset of its Parliamentary life a series of boroughs, and you now propose to do away with their ancient traditions. Your Lordships have of late years accentuated the fact that London is not one gigantic borough. Both Houses of Parliament have passed Bills that have divided London into boroughs and given to each of those municipalities the same organisation&#x2014;mayors, aldermen, councillor&#x2014;exactly the same in every single one of those boroughs as exist in the large towns in the United Kingdom You now want to abolish the whole of that and to make London one borough, and you do that only for the purpose of depriving those who have plural votes of the extra votes to which they are at present entitled. You are going, you say, to remove an anomaly, but while you remove one anomaly by this Bill so far as London itself goes, you create another by depriving the dual voter in London of a vote which, if you compare like with like, is possessed by similar persons in other parts of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02152">You cannot, it seems to me compare London with a town like Liverpool or Manchester. You must compare like with like, and if you do that, let me just show what the effect of this Bill will be. The noble Lord said that I knew Liverpool well, and asked whether I would like to deprive those who change their residences from one constituency to another of their votes. No I should not; but I should like to make
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0259"/>
<col>505</col>
it equally easy for men all over the country who change their places of residence to take their vote with them. Compare Liverpool with any area in London which contains the same population. If your Lordships will take the trouble to look at the figures you will find that there are exactly the same number of Members for Liverpool as there are, not for the whole of London, but in the one part which is known as the Tower Hamlets. Surely, if you endeavour to put both on the same footing, you must look at like with like. I will continue that still further by asking you, if it is a question of distance as from one constituency to another, to test on a map of this country the area that London as you would now create it would occupy if put down in another part of England. I will give the noble Lord two cases. Let him put down the area of London where Birmingham now is and he would find that it would comprise not only Birmingham but five Parliamentary boroughs, not to mention the county constituencies which intervene. Then let the noble Lord put down the area in London where Manchester now is. He would there find that it would cover not only Manchester but seven other boroughs. I could go on giving your Lordships instances; but Liverpool is surely an example that may be worth quoting. A man lives in Westminster and has his business, we will say, in Southwark. He has now two votes. Under this Bill he is to lose one. A man lives in Liverpool and has his business in Birkenhead. Under this Bill he is not touched, and he will still have his two votes. I do not know that there is any difference between the two. One river is a little broader than the other, and I do not think it is much dirtier; otherwise there is no difference between the man who lives in Liverpool and has his business in Birkenhead and the man who lives in Westminster and has his business in Southwark.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02153">I know perfectly well that the answer will be, "If we had our Plural Voting Bill that we asked for three years ago that anomaly would not exist." Yes; but you did not have your Plural Voting Bill of three years ago. It was rejected by this House. We are always told when your Lordships throw out a Bill that there is going to be a conflagration; but I noticed that there was no deep commotion caused by the rejection of that Bill. That Bill was rejected on the advice of my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn. He asked your Lordships to reject for the
<col>506</col>
whole country what I now ask your Lordships to reject for London in particular. I cannot pretend to speak with anything like the weight or the influence of the noble Viscount, but I hope I have been able to show to your Lordships that this Bill is not a Bill for enfranchisement, but a Bill for disfranchisement. It is a Bill for introducing into the limited area of London the principle of the Plural Voting Bill which your Lordships rejected three years ago.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02155"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from long experience on the London County Council I have come to the conclusion that this Bill is a very desirable measure in itself. I see in it the completion of measures which have already been passed by Parliament in order to consolidate London and to make the capital of the Empire what it ought to be, one great consolidated city. I heard with very great regret the speech of the noble Earl opposite in which he moved the rejection of the Bill, and I cannot help feeling that the arguments, forcible in themselves, which he put forward with great moderation, did not really touch the root of the subject with which this Bill deals. I know it has always been said by opponents of a measure like this, and it has been repeated on the present occasion, that London is different from other cities, that it is not a consolidated city, that it is not fitted to be a consolidated city, that, in fact, it is a loose confederation of municipalities with no common interests, and, therefore, that those separate municipalities may be treated as separate units with no claim to a common government of any sort or kind.<lb/>
The noble Earl called attention to the Act which was passed by the late Government creating the borough councils, but it struck me that there was a very considerable omission in his allusion to that matter, because he never mentioned a very important measure&#x2014;probably the greatest measure affecting London that has been passed within the last century&#x2014;the Act which created the administrative County Council of London. The County Council of London was brought into being by the Party opposite. It was, I believe, a very wise measure, for it realised the fact that these different districts of London have common interests, that it was necessary to provide for those
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0260"/>
<col>507</col>
common interests, and that that could only be effected by having one unified London. I venture to think that that Act of the Conservative Party, which I believe to have been an extremely wise one, is an effective answer to the arguments which have just been addressed to your Lordships by the noble Earl when he maintained that London did not permit of being made a unified city, and when he pleaded that the different municipalities and districts of the metropolis were absolutely independent of one another. The action of the Conservative Government in passing in the year 1888 the Act to which I have referred established the fact that all the districts of London have common interests, and that those interests can only be provided for by a common government; and the creation of the borough councils, so far from being an argument in favour of the breaking up of London is an argument entirely in a contrary directtion, inasmuch as they were created merely as subordinate authorities, entrusted, and rightly, with the management of their own local affairs, but subject to the control of the London County Council and forming part of the great central administrative county.<lb/>
I cannot help feeling a little surprised at the line taken by noble Lords opposite in speaking thus disparagingly of the Capital of the Empire. I cannot understand how noble Lords who most consistently argue as to the dignity and duties of the Empire should make it their object to, if I may venture to say so, degrade the Capital of the Empire, to deny practically that there is a Capital of the Empire, and to argue that that Capital consists merely of a number of loose confederated municipal boroughs. But, further than that, I do venture to think that the policy of the Conservative Government in the Act of 1888 and in subsequent measures has been an extremely wise one. The effect of that Act has been to go a very long way in obviating a great danger which was threatening London&#x2014;namely, the creation of cities of the rich and cities of the poor&#x2014;and in teaching the richer districts that they have some connection with the poorer districts and impressing upon the public mind that the richer districts have not only a material but a moral interest in the welfare of the poorer districts. I would ask this question: If that policy of 1888 was a true one, if it was good policy to create a central consolidated administrative county of London, if it was
<col>508</col>
desirable to give to London in that respect consolidated government, can the Party that brought in that measure bring forward any valid argument against the slight extension of the principle which is proposed in this Bill?<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite has referred to the Plural Voting Bill that was rejected a few years ago by your Lordships' House. That was a Bill to put an end to plural voting generally; but in this case is it not the fact that London is put to a great disadvantage compared with cities such as those of which the noble Earl has spoken? There are very few chances of plural voting in the cities to which reference has been made, but it is the fact that a man may have thirty-six votes in London. Of course, that is an extreme case, but a man in London may have the power of qualifying under the various qualifications and so obtaining that number of votes. For a long time past it has been the general policy of Parliament to put an end to plural voting within a borough or within the same constituency. London alone, for some reason or other, has been left outside that provision, and it seems extraordinary that noble Lords opposite should contend that what is good in that respect for Liverpool and Manchester for some reason or other should not apply to London. There is no question whatever that the existence of plural voting in London is a matter which puts London to a very great extent at a disadvantage in regard to other parts of the country&#x2014;perhaps I ought not to say a disadvantage, but it creates an anomaly against London which I think it is very difficult for noble Lords opposite logically to defend.<lb/>
If we pass to the other important question dealt with by the Bill&#x2014;successive occupation, which I think the noble Earl opposite has spoken of, I will not say contemptuously, but has rather passed by as unimportant&#x2014;I venture to think that a disqualification which has been found by an analysis of the voting in five London boroughs to amount to a loss of 10,000 votes out of 160,000 is no light disqualification, and that the evil of which we complain is one that needs an early remedy. Nor can I see that there is any ground for saying that in order to remove these anomalies we must wait for a general measure. These anomalies are patent, they are very easily removed; they are anomalies which it is impossible for noble
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0261"/>
<col>509</col>
Lords opposite logically to defend; and I therefore cannot but express my great regret that noble Lords opposite should feel it necessary to perpetuate those anomalies for objects which I think at all events are quite insufficient, and for which up to the present no valid reason has been put forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02156"><member>LORD FARQUHAR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with great diffidence that I venture to address your Lordships on this occasion, but my excuse must be that I feel strongly the injustice of this Bill, the rejection of which has been so ably moved by the noble Earl, Lord Derby, with whose arguments I entirely concur. I do not see why London should be selected and treated differently from every other part of the country, and why the Government should, by this Bill, deprive the citizens of London of their votes in the constituency in which they carry on their business. It would be turning business into a burlesque by arriving at the farcical position that the Parliamentary representatives of the city of London, the greatest banking and commercial centre of the world, would be elected, not by the great bankers, financiers, merchants, and trades people, but by their caretakers and watchmen. That would be degrading London.<lb/>
I have been connected with London municipal affairs ever since the existence of the London County Council; I had the privilege of introducing the Bill for the creation of the borough councils into this House, and I know something of the feeling in regard to the present Bill. I can safely say that besides the City Corporation seven-eights at least of the banking, financial, mercantile, and tradesmen's communities in the metropolis are strongly opposed to the Bill. I would like to know what evidence there is to show that there is any demand at all for this change which would place the London elector on an inferior basis to that of an elector in all provincial boroughs. Such an act of injustice as is proposed would only go to increase the want of confidence now existing in the city of London caused by the Socialistic tendencies of the present Government, and especially those of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which so seriously threaten the credit and financial supremacy of our country.<lb/>
It is this point, a some what indirect one,
<col>510</col>
I admit, which has influenced me most, although I agree most cordially with every argument used by the noble Earl who has moved the rejection of the Bill. If we look at the price of Government, railway, and industrial stocks of this country, and make inquiry as to the markets in these stocks, we find that what used to be large and active markets are to-day small and lifeless ones, and that the holders of these stocks have difficulty in realizing them, even at a sacrifice, to re-invest in foreign securities, the dividends on which are payable abroad. Millions and tens of millions are being sent out of the country for this purpose which will never return in any shape. No wonder at such a moment the Government would like to confiscate the votes of the citizens of London, who are sure to record them for their destruction, and mostly for the reasons which I have ventured to lay before your Lordships. This Bill is really a Party attack on the stronghold of Unionism, and, should it pass, it would be a great injustice to, and against the will of an overwhelming majority of the people of London.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02157"><member>THE MARQUESS OF NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened attentively to the speech which has just been delivered by the noble Lord opposite, who, I think, was under a misapprehension as to the Bill we are discussing. At the commencement of the proceedings this evening a First Reading was given to the Finance Bill, and I think the noble Lord's speech would have been more appropriate at that time than at the present moment. We are not discussing now the question of taxation, but we are discussing a question of equal importance to a very large number of our fellow-countrymen. Both noble Lords who have spoken against this Bill seem to me to have lost hold of the most important principle of the measure. Are we in favour, or are we not, of continuing the policy which was initiated by the Conservative Government in 1888 in considering London as one whole?</membercontribution></p>

<col>511</col>
by this Bill. It was not the Liberal party who brought about the existence of the London County Council. The London County Council possesses larger powers than any other county council in the United Kingdom; it not only has all the great municipal functions, but it has the right to collect and spend the larger part of the rates. The London County Council is practically the municipality of London; and I cannot understand why noble Lords opposite should lose sight altogether of the great importance of having this unit in the Capital of the Empire, just as much as we have it in other cities. London was made one for municipal purposes by the Unionist Government. And may I say that it has been very rare when a political Party has taken a high-sounding name for a political purpose that it has had the chance of proving its right to that name in such a short space of time as was the case when the Unionist Government passed the Act creating the London County Council?<lb/>
We are referred to Birmingham, Manchester, and Salford, and it is said, Why not do the same thing for them? But the circumstances are totally different. We support this Bill coming before your Lordships for one purpose and for one purpose only&#x2014;to obtain for London what every other large town has obtained. It seems to me that any one who is in favour of every qualified inhabitant of London having the power of exercising his vote at general and by-elections must be in favour of the principles of this Bill. Will any noble Lord get up and say that he is opposed to that principle? It is that which we are going to bring about by this Bill. I should like to deal with one or two of the objections that have been raised. The principal objection has reference to plural voting, and the chief reason why noble Lords have come down to this House to-day to destroy this Bill is that by it plural voting would be done away with in the area of London. I believe that is the sole reason of the objection of noble Lords opposite to this Bill; because I do not fancy for one moment that they object to the voter if he is qualified having the power to record his vote. I do not believe any single noble Lord opposite wishes to disfranchise any inhabitant of London, but they desire to preserve the plural vote, and that is the only reason for their opposition to this Bill.<lb/>
<col>512</col>
Now, as regards the plural voter, we are told that the Government have introduced this measure not for the sake of carrying out the principle which I have ventured to lay before your Lordships, but for the sole purpose of gerrymandering and in some way gaining seats in London. I am aware that when that statement was made before it was met with cheers, and I am wondering whether it will ever be possible for noble Lords opposite to believe that there are some honest gentlemen in the Liberal Party. I support this Bill considering myself as responsible as any member of the Government as far as that charge is concerned, and I will say this, that I consider it would be just as fair, although I would not do it, for me to stand up in this House and accuse noble Lords opposite of dishonest conduct or gerrymandering, or whatever it may be called, because they oppose this Bill thinking it may lose them some seats. We ought not to have any idea in our minds as to whether one bit of London goes to one Party or another. That, in my opinion, is a small matter. I think that the Party opposite have a political supremacy in the constituencies in London. I have never looked upon London as a Liberal city. I have had some experience, because I contested a division and I also sat on the London County Council for some years. I believe that if you had to give some political title to London you would have to call it Tory-Democratic. London is to my mind instinctively Conservative. I have regretted that fact many a time. I do not believe there is a question of your getting one seat or losing one seat, or of our gaining or losing a seat. Londoners will settle that for themselves. I do not believe the abolition of plural voting would make much difference as regards the representation of the constituencies.<lb/>
I want to get away from the Party point of view altogether. This ought not to be, and I do not believe it is, a Party Bill. It is a Bill to give justice to those who are disfranchised at present when elections take place, and it gives the possibility of holding all elections on one day, which is of supreme importance to the trade of London. As regards convenience and everything else this Bill would be a blessing to us all. I shall probably be told that, after all, nothing can do away with the point that we have introduced this Bill for some sinister Party motive.

<col>513</col>
This House is rapidly gaining for itself a reputation, which it did not formerly have, of attacking subjects and measures from a purely Party point of view. There, is nothing more regrettable&#x2014;and I believe noble Lords opposite will agree with me&#x2014;than that the two great political Parties in the State should be so unequally divided in this House. It is because we are so unequally divided, because we who sit here are in such a small minority whilst noble Lords opposite are in such an overwhelming permanent majority that I think you ought to be a little more generous to the minority in the accusations which you bring against them. If I thought for one moment that His Majesty's Government had introduced this Bill simply in order to try and win a few seats, I for one would at once separate myself from them and would be one of the first to denounce them. But it is because I believe that the Cabinet is composed of men as honest and straightforward as any members on the opposite side of the House, because I know them as my personal friends to be perfectly honest, straightforward gentlemen, that I refuse to think for one moment that this is in any sense a Party measure and I ask your Lordships to give it a Second Reading as a measure of justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02160"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who for a good many years represented one of the constituencies in London and who was returned on four separate occasions as the representative of the borough of Lewisham, which is so often quoted in this connection, containing, as it does, a population of 127,000, I desire to oppose this Bill. The noble Marquess who has just sat down suggested that the sole objection we have on this side of the House is on the question of plural voting. I will give him another objection. I refer to the manner in which your Lordships' House has been treated in this matter, of which I think we have a right to complain. If this Bill is of the importance that the noble Lord who moved its Second Reading and the noble Marquess who has just spoken appear to think and if there is this great injustice done to London as a whole, why is it that we only get the Bill on the 8th of November?<lb/>
I think when we consider how the Bill has been treated in another place we have a right to complain. The First Reading was moved under the ten-minute rule, and
<col>514</col>
if it had not been for the impassioned speeches to which we have listened in this House we should have thought that it was one of those elaborate jokes so dear to the family of Harcourt, carefully elaborated in their home and reproduced for the edification of the House of Commons. The First Reading took place in April, the Second Reading in June, and it is needless to remind your Lordships that the Second Reading was closured. One of the stock charges always brought against those who sit on this side and who agree with us is that we are always pressing for redistribution. I take it that until redistribution comes we shall always press for it. Mr. Harcourt in another place accused Sir Henry Kimber of being so obsessed with a desire for redistribution that if anybody had brought in a Bill for the revision of the Book of Common Prayer he would have moved for a redistribution of the Ten Commandments. There is no necessity for any redistribution of the Ten Commandments now. That has already been done. So much prominence by recent events has been given to the ninth commandment that it has assumed a position of importance which was never intended by the original framer of the Decalogue.<lb/>
Then we come to the next stage of the Bill&#x2014;the reference of the Committee stage to Grand Committee. The Bill was sent to Grand Committee in spite of a distinct pledge given by the late Prime Minister that no measure of that kind should be so treated. In the discussion that took place in the other House the present Prime Minister said that no measure such as this was in the mind of the late Prime Minister when he gave that promise. I wonder how he knows that. The only explanation I can suggest is that he has obtained this knowledge by adopting a system to which reference has been made and by which a good deal of support is supposed to be obtained for other Government measures&#x2014;by the assistance of Mr. Stead and the Julia Bureau. I venture to say that where a pledge is given the Party to which it is given has a right to say something when it is broken. I submit that the sending of this Bill to Grand Committee was a distinct breach of a pledge. Then we come to the Third Reading and the Report stage. That took place on October 18, and it is now on November 8 that we are asked to read the Bill a second
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0264"/>
<col>515</col>
time. I object most strongly to the Second Reading for the reasons I have given, and I object equally strongly on account of the measure itself.<lb/>
I do not propose to go at any length into those reasons, but we have heard that the object of the Bill is to secure successive voting. Comparisons have been made over and over again with regard to London as an entity and to other large towns in the provinces, and it has been shown, I think conclusively, that there is no comparison; and, of course, as long as we have electoral boundaries any constituent who passes over those boundaries will lose his vote. Personally I should like to see this proposal as to successive voting given to the whole country and not to only part. The same with regard to polling taking place on the same day. That I believe to be a good thing, and I should like to see it extended so that every county and every borough recorded its vote on the same day. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Welby, compared the present Bill with what was done by the Conservative Government in the formation of the London County Council. These two proposals are hardly on the same plane. There is no intention on our part to disparage London, but we do not see why a man in London should alone be deprived of the undoubted right of plural voting. Those, I believe, are the principal objects with which the Bill has been brought in. As I have said, I do not for one moment believe that the Bill is necessary. I do not believe it is a good Bill; and putting Party feeling entirely on one side, and largely on the ground of the manner in which the Bill has been presented to your Lordships' House, I shall support its rejection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02161"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one form of argument has been used by the noble Earl who has just sat down which I think is somewhat novel, and I am not sure that it is very expedient. He told us what had happened to this Bill in the House of Commons. He did not say that it had reached this House too late to receive adequate consideration, because that obviously is not the case. So far as I know there is very little, if anything, for your Lordships' House to do for ten days or a fortnight to come. He complained of the Bill having been sent to a Grand Committee of the House of Commons. Is the House of Commons not to be permitted
<col>516</col>
in the same way as this House is permitted to manage its own business in its own way and to conduct its internal affairs in its own fashion? On one former occasion I adverted to this subject, and I cannot help thinking there is some danger and some inconvenience, not to one Party or one Government only, in constituting ourselves censors and arbiters of the manner in which the other House chooses to manage its own business. Apart from that I am afraid that there is no use in prolonging the debate, because as soon as any Amendment to a Government measure has been moved from the Front Opposition Bench&#x2014;I might almost say from any Opposition Bench&#x2014;its obituary notice alone remains to be written, and obituary notices are proverbially short.<lb/>
What is this Bill? It is not a Bill applying to the whole country and to all constituencies. It is an exceptional Bill, applying only to London, because the conditions under which Londoners vote are exceptional, and differ from those in other parts of the country. Can any one deny that, while London has a County Council transacting the business of the county, the whole of London is a city, one corporate whole? Lord Derby admitted&#x2014;I think he is the only member of the Opposition in this House who has admitted&#x2014;that there is a hardship. Of course there is a great hardship, which results in the disfranchisement of thousands of people in London every year through no fault of their own. He says that the same thing exists in other towns. With great respect to him, I think he is completely wrong. In all Parliamentary boroughs except London, all boroughs, that is, which return several Members of Parliament, electors in one part of the borough can remove to another part of the borough and yet retain their votes by the rule of successive occupation. In London they cannot. In every other town an elector can vote in respect of one qualification only, though he may have six or nine qualifications, and all elections in a borough take place on the same day.<lb/>
In London there are fifty-nine constituencies returning members, and there are twenty-nine boroughs, the City of London excepted, and the City is the only one of them of which the municipal and Parliamentary boundaries are coterminous. In all others the boundaries overlap&#x2014;in many of them to a very large extent. The consequence
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0265"/>
<col>517</col>
is that an elector loses his vote, for example, by moving from Bond-street to Piccadilly, though both streets are in the same metropolitan borough. On the other hand, if he moves from a street in the metropolitan borough of Poplar to one in Bethnal Green he preserves it. What can be the reason for maintaining anomalies of that kind? An elector who has offices in Bond-street, Charing Cross, and Parliament-street&#x2014;all within a few yards of one another&#x2014;may vote for three members of Parliament, but he can only vote at one County Council election. On the other hand, in the Tower Hamlets he may vote in five different borough elections, but only for one member of Parliament. What aggravates this mischief and anomaly is that Londoners move more freely and constantly from one part to another than do the people in any other part of the kingdom. I believe it is the case that in many of the constituencies thirty per cent. of the electors move in the course of a year. It is estimated that no fewer than 40,000 electors in London lose their votes every year by reason of this. That is the state of things which we seek to remedy.<lb/>
The result, I agree, is that those who have plural votes within the area of London will lose all but one vote. That is the inevitable result, but that is not the object of the Bill at all. The object is to do away with the inconvenience, mischief, and injustice which undoubtedly exist in London. It has been recalled that Viscount St. Aldwyn moved to reject the Plural Voting Bill, and that the motion was carried in this House. We make no secret of the fact that we are against plural voting. At the same time, I cannot see how any parallel can be drawn between this Bill and a Bill that dealt with plural voting all over the country. This is exceptional in its character, dealing only with anomalies which apply to London.<lb/>
It has been suggested that in order to remove those anomalies we should bring in a Redistribution Bill for the whole of the United Kingdom. That is a colossal task. The noble Earl was a member of the Government which attempted it in the year 1895, and the difficulties which arose at that time were such that, after adumbrating a scheme, the Government made haste to drop the Bill and to leave the subject alone. It is impossible to tack to a Bill of this kind a redistribution scheme even for London, but to do so for the whole of the country
<col>518</col>
seems to me to be almost a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. I am sorry to have taken up so much time in the fruitless task of putting what I am afraid will be a very unsuccessful argument, as I have so often had to do before. For my own part I am heartily glad that the Bill should contain provisions having the effect of ending plural voting, but the main purpose of the Bill is to remove the anomalies I have described. Merely in justice the electors of London should be able to use their franchise on the same conditions as other citizens of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02162"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech to which we have just listened was, we shall all agree, moderate and cautious; but I do not believe that the noble and learned Lord is justified in his assumption that because an amendment has been moved from this side of the House, therefore whatever be the course of the debate the Bill would be rejected. But I think that the noble and learned Lord by the admirable speech which he has delivered has done much to minimise the issue which is before us and to direct your Lordships' consideration, not to the results of the Bill, which we are bound to consider, but to the objects of the Bill which exist in the minds of His Majesty's Government. The noble Marquess opposite justified those objects and called upon us for generosity. I do not think that those who have studied the speeches of members of the Government in the country have any reason to admonish your Lordships upon the subject of generosity. I believe there has hardly been a speech at the end of a session in which prominent members of the Government have not boasted before the country of the exceptional amount of legislation&#x2014;and novel legislation&#x2014;they have passed into law; and I think the noble Marquess and his friends ought to have had the generosity to admit that many of the Bills, which have been faulty to the last degree and have not received the support of many noble Lords opposite, have been put in order by this side of the House, and been given to the country in a much more effective condition than when they came to this House.</membercontribution></p>

<col>519</col>
what is so obviously, or seems on the surface to be, a Party gain&#x2014;that we are never to see anything of the dictates of Party when one single question is taken out of all others, and when one only of the many anomalies existing in our electoral laws is singled out for redress. The noble Lord who introduced the measure said this was not, unfortunately, the moment when other anomalies could be redressed. I submit that this Bill is unique; that it violates every tradition on which reform Bills which have passed through both Houses of Parliament have been founded. Past measures have been national and universal; this Bill is local and partial. Past measures have added to the electorate and have been most careful of votes which were already given. Mr. Gladstone himself, in a most pregnant sentence, said, with regard to the Franchise Bill of 1884, that it did not interfere with the right already legally acquired, however illegitimate it might seem to be. But this Bill, while it undoubtedly, as Lord Derby pointed out, might by a single registration clause have given to all parts, of the country, with probably the universal consent of your Lordships, the enfranchisement which it proposes, this Bill is a measure of disfranchisement, and an exceptional proposal for London. There is no denying, moreover, that once on the Statute Book it would be made the jumping-off place for a further extension of the same principle to other parts of the country.<lb/>
Then past measures which have been introduced have also preserved communities. I do not think that either of the great Reform Bills of 1867 and 1885 would have spared the smaller boroughs but for the fact that, as the introducer of each of them pointed out, the past tradition of Great Britain had been to represent communities and not to represent classes, to avoid putting one class against another. I believe this to be the kernel of our electoral laws. An American writer the other day pointed out, in a most studied and admirable work, that the reason that all classes in this country understand each other so well as compared to America and other parts of the world is that in matters like sport they are all engaged together and learn each others difficulties and become mutually acquainted with each other. If in a matter of that kind there is this gain, I ask your Lordships what is to be the result if you adopt legislation which is going to divide constituencies into rich and poor, which is going to prevent the
<col>520</col>
east from joining hands with the west, to divide men whose interests ought to be in common, and separate sympathies which ought to be mutual? No greater change could be made in our electoral laws than if you force all employers to vote in one place and all employed to vote in another. That would be the effect of this Bill so far as London is concerned. In London, in the boroughs of long standing, there is a great deal of local patriotism, and blending them into one vast whole is certainly not likely to be conducive to that local life which was set up, not by the establishment of the London County Council, but by the formation of the borough councils with separate constitutions and all the appanage of separate constitution.<lb/>
Past Bills have decentralised the administration of our electoral laws, and have trusted the local authorities. This Bill proceeds on the novel practice which seems to infect every Government measure at the present time of uniting all power, patronage, and responsibility in one official sitting in the neighbourhood of Westminster. In this case the over-worked permanent head of the London County Council is to be made responsible for the lists for an electorate of 700,000 voters&#x2014;the largest electorate in the world&#x2014;and I am surprised at the proposal to make one revising barrister responsible for the preparation of the whole of these lists. I sincerely hope that if the Lord Chief Justice ever has to name this one unfortunate individual he will see that he has some detective experience, for I notice that on the list for London there are seventy-nine men of the name of John Smith alone and forty-nine of the name of David Jones. How is any one man to take up in the centre the work which has always been done in the locality of separating men of the same name? I have only to state these facts to show how difficult would be the labour.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Welby, urged that we should pass this Bill on the ground that London was a borough; but he made that appeal to your Lordships after he had spent some minutes in explaining how great was London as a county. If London is a county then obviously it is to be treated like other counties and other organisations which in the same compass have a large number of independent seats. The noble Lord opposite said, Why not redress one small anomaly. But
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0267"/>
<col>521</col>
there are anomalies in electoral law infinitely worse than those which have been referred to. Is it not an anomaly that you should have 103 members to 4,400,000 inhabitants in Ireland, while there are seventy-two members for 4,500,000 inhabitants of Scotland, and fifty-nine for nearly 6,000,000 inhabitants in London? But those anomalies remain untouched by this Bill. Again, half of the present House of Commons are elected by close upon 5,000,000 electors; the other half are elected by 2,000,000 electors. Is not that an anomaly worthy of the attention of His Majesty's Government? Again, the borough of Wandsworth has 27,000 electors, whilst the borough of Kilkenny has only 1,600. Is not that, too, an anomaly? Such is the distribution of electoral power at this moment that His Majesty's Government at the General Election obtained a majority in the House of Commons of 354, but, reckoned by votes, their majority should only have been ninety-four. If that had been the majority most of the Bills with which your Lordships have had to deal would never have been sent here at all. I ask your Lordships whether the anomalies used with such skill by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack are to be compared with those which I have just described under an electoral law which was pronounced by the late Sir William Harcourt sixteen years ago to be full of glaring defects, and which he said it was the business of a Liberal Government to amend, and amend sooner than later. I cannot help wishing that that strong pronouncement had been present to the mind of the First Commissioner of Works, and that he had not allowed his political zeal to outrun his filial piety.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite said that although the Plural Voting Bill had been rejected by this House, the people who would gain their votes by this Bill were appealing to your Lordships' House for justice. Where do we find that appeal? Have any Petitions been presented? There has not been a single Petition presented to this House in favour of the Bill. I believe three have been presented against the Bill. I cannot say that even in the appearance of the Benches opposite we find an exaggerated desire on the part of supporters of this Administration to record their votes in favour of this Bill. And certainly if we are to make other glaring inconsistencies of our electoral law more
<col>522</col>
grotesque by the introduction of this principle for one city, then clearly it can only be done or could only be done, in deference to a large amount of popular support, of which, I venture to say, there is not the smallest evidence in this House or outside.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said that London was exceptional, and was therefore a proper subject for exceptional legislation. Now I venture to say that if your Lordships pass this Bill you will take a step which is unprecedented in the whole history of Reform Bills. Look back at any of the great Reform Bills. Were there no exceptions which might have been made to the Bill of 1831? I think those who have read the Debates of that day will bear me out when I say that in regard to that Bill a landslide which almost became a revolution could have been avoided if the Minister of the day had been willing to tinker with the matter and to make exceptions which would have spoilt perhaps the general effect, but which would have prevented the immense public feeling aroused. Look again at the Bill of 1867. I do not suppose there ever was a Bill upon which there was so much doubt or so much reason to make exceptions. It was before national education had been introduced and when communications to newspapers were comparatively scanty compared with what they are at the present day; certainly the difference between towns like London and Manchester and the more remote parts of the country in education and political fitness was enormous, but the statesmen of the day gave to those remote parts, despite many protests, the same privileges which they bestowed on the centre of the Empire.<lb/>
Still more so was that the case in 1885. Many sitting round me will remember a great discussion which was aroused in the House of Commons as to the leaving of Ireland out of the Bill, and I well remember the brilliant oratorical effort made by a noble Lord, Lord Rathmore, who, unfortunately, too seldom speaks in this House, to whom great justice was done by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, in his "Life of Gladstone." He pointed out that if you gave to Ireland the franchise which was then proposed for England, it would be given to men thirty or forty per cent. of whom were illiterate, and the Ballot Act would be defeated because they would be bound to make their declarations in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0268"/>
<col>523</col>
public and undergo that very intimidation which it was the object of the Ballot Act to avoid. So great was the effect produced by that speech that I remember a member of the present Government telling me that it had convinced even the members of the Party opposite, and that an Amendment would have been carried except for the intervention of Mr. Gladstone. His argument was that in matters of franchise you could not make exceptions; the more remote a man was the more necessary it was that his grievance should be considered, and he convinced Parliament that without regard to political fitness or education it was necessary to give with an open hand and fully to all concerned the franchise to which all had a common claim. Will the strongest and warmest advocate of this measure say that that principle can ever be carried out if you are going to make the sort of exceptions which it is proposed to make to-night?<lb/>
There are, no doubt, great reasons for a new Bill if you maintain that the workingman, because of his habit of moving by reason of the necessities of his life, is unduly deprived of political power; then I cannot see on what principle a man is not injured who removes form Manchester to Salford, Liverpool to Birkenhead, or Newcastle to Gateshead, which boroughs are one indeed in reality although not so in name, much more than St. George's in the East and St. George's, Hanover Square. The First Commissioner of Works said he objected to the property qualification. If you think that the payment of rates and taxes is a thing which you can ignore, and that a man is to be regarded as fit to vote simply because he exists, and if it is to be said that property has nothing to do with the matter, then I say the change ought to be effected by a Bill which deals with all constituencies, and ought not to be brought in by a side wind. To say to a man, You must give up your political power; to deny a man representation in the place where he works among those with whom his whole fiscal interests are bound up, is a course which Parliament ought not to adopt except after mature consideration and as a general measure.<lb/>
Before I sit down I would appeal to your Lordships not to regard this question from any of those smaller standpoints to which allusion was made by the noble Marquess opposite. Measures of reform surely cannot be considered in this House from the point
<col>524</col>
of view of their effect on any election or even on a succession of elections. Many of those who based themselves on these considerations have been disappointed in the past, but in any case your Lordships' House would lose, I submit, all title to legislate if we did not attempt to have regard, not to passing sentiment, but to the permanent conclusions of the people. You will not do that by dividing constituencies between rich and poor, by encouraging people to consider how they can best represent their class rather than their community. It is very easy to tell a democracy that they are infallible, that they need no steering gear, that property is no test and education no guide. Who, however, can guarantee political stability, which is vital to any progress in our home affairs and equally vital to any permanent policy in Imperial questions, if the people are left to work out everything by themselves without the help of others who are associated with them?<lb/>
I ask your Lordships, Is not this a practical question for everyone? Is it not already becoming more difficult every year for a Government to maintain a continuous policy owing to the shiftings of popular opinion, and is it not a serious matter to weaken in any case the electoral stability which has given something like a reasoned popular opinion in the past? If you are going to adopt this policy I would say, let us have it as a considered policy to be adopted throughout the country and not bring it forward at almost I the last moment of the longest session on record, as the last experiment of a harassed Government to administer a narcotic to one portion of the electorate, while not touching another very large portion who have an equal claim. My Lords, I believe that this measure has been shown by my noble friends who have I already spoken to be partial and unprecedented. I think it is a retrograde measure in which the interests of a part have been preferred to the interests of the whole, in which local considerations have been allowed to outweigh Imperial prudence, and I urge your Lordships to refuse it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<col>525</col>
Viscount over the very wide field which he traversed in his interesting speech. The noble Viscount dealt skilfully and broadly with the whole subject of Parliamentary reform, illustrated by historical instances, and he wound up with an appeal for a general policy of Parliamentary reform. But, my Lords, the noble Viscount seemed to me&#x2014;I will not say to fall into an error, because I have no doubt he did it intentionally&#x2014;but to take a course which is only too familiar to us on this side of the House, and it is this. When some anomaly is mentioned, and it is proposed by a Parliamentary measure to remove it, we are continually met with the argument:&#x2014;"What is the use of dealing with the matter in this piecemeal fashion? If you are to remove anomalies, you must sweep them all away at once."<lb/>
But the whole custom of legislation in this country has been towards piecemeal legislation. All the reform Bills to which the noble Viscount alluded were unquestionably piecemeal measures, full of exceptions, hedged round with safeguards, and conferring the trust of the franchise on one limited class at a time. My Lords, it is all very well to say that you must deal with all anomalies at once. The noble Viscount is prepared to repeal the Union between Great Britain and Ireland in order to redress what he considers to be the electoral disproportion between Ireland and Scotland; and he is prepared also apparently for something like equal electoral divisions all over the United Kingdom. That is all very well, and it may come. A great number of things may come, although these particular things may not come within the lifetime of most of us here. But that is really no argument for saying that if you have a chance of meeting a particular grievance, the existence of which is not denied, you should not take that chance, provided, of course, that you can show that in doing so you are not inflicting a worse grievance on anybody else. And I think it is not difficult to show in regard to this measure that this is the case.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said, and we all appreciated his saying it, that it is as well not to impute Party motives in relation to a measure of this kind, and he alluded to the protest so well made by the noble Marquess behind me. Yes, my Lords, but we did not begin it. The charge was
<col>526</col>
brought against us that this measure was introduced by reason of the fact that a certain number of plural votes would be lost, and there was an implication, and even more than an implication, that we hoped to gain some electoral advantage by the manoeuvre. My noble friend the noble Marquess behind me pointed out with great force that this is a double-edged argument&#x2014;that if it were true that we were only guided by electoral considerations in desiring to deprive a certain number of voters of the plural vote, it might be equally true to say that noble Lords opposite only valued the plural vote because they believed it would be given in their interest. I do not make that charge, and I am equally desirous that the other charge should not be made against us. If there is no great moral beauty in the one attitude there is no great moral beauty in the other, and I think we can leave the matter there and cry quits, disclaiming on both sides, as I am quite sure we can, a Party motive in the matter. Anyone who is disposed to be cynical might further point out that if this Bill is an attempt to gerrymander, it is a very poor attempt, and one which, so far as I have information, would be of very small service from a Party point of view. I think it would be very difficult for anybody to I point to a London seat which would be gained to one Party or lost to another, or even endangered, by this measure if it were passed.<lb/>
Now, the line of demarcation between the two Parties is a clear one. We stand for the recognition of the unity of London, whereas noble Lords opposite show, not for the first time&#x2014;for indeed they have shown it, I was going to say, hundreds of times before&#x2014;a mistrust of a great London and a desire to see London disintegrated into the component parts out of which it is no doubt true the great London as we know it has come together. Noble Lords opposite would like to go back, I have no doubt, to the days of the village of Kensington, the quite separate city of Westminster, and the other hamlets and villages which crowned the northern heights. The noble Viscount used what seemed to me a somewhat strange argument in relation to this question of one London or the many boroughs forming a federated London. He said that if all the workers voted in one part and all the employers in another part that would be destructive to the sense
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0270"/>
<col>527</col>
of community of interest and anything like corporate life. I should have thought that nothing could have done so much to destroy the sense of unity of corporate life as this incessant dwelling on the existence of the different cities and boroughs of London. If a man is taught to think more of himself as a resident in Westminster or St. George's Hanover-square, than as a citizen of London it must weaken his sense both of pride in London as a whole and his sense of duty towards the more remote parts of London which he has, perhaps, scarcely ever seen. Our desire is to accentuate in every way the unity of the great city in order to quicken the sense of pride in citizenship of the greatest city in the world, and also to stimulate the sense of duty of those who live in the richer quarters towards the great mass who live in the poorer quarters.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Farquhar, dwelt on the importance of the metropolitan boroughs. I have no desire to say a word against the organisation of the metropolitan boroughs, but it is not accurate to think or speak of them as if they were comparable to or commensurate with boroughs as we understand them in other parts of England. It is true that they are decorated with the appanage of boroughs, with the robes and chains which distinguish officers of boroughs all over the country, but none of the municipal powers which we understand as belonging to great boroughs are conferred upon them. It is necessary, therefore, to draw that distinction, because when you speak of Liverpool and Birkenhead on the one hand, and Westminster and Poplar on the other, you must remember that Westminster and Poplar are under one municipal management. Liverpool and Birkenhead are two absolutely distinct cities differently governed in every way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02166"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Not in every way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02167"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps not in everyway, but the London boroughs would be more fitly compared with the relations which exist between a county council and a district council in an ordinary county area. Now, my Lords, it really comes down to this. We frankly admit that we do not like plural voting. Plural voting is objectionable to us from two points of view. We do not think that property, as such, demands separate representation, but we say that,
<col>528</col>
if it does, plural voting is not the way to give it, because one man might own the whole area of a large county constituency and have only one vote there, whereas another man having the most trivial property interests in twenty or twenty-five constituencies in different parts of England is supplied with a vote for each, and is able to exercise a great number of those votes by the fact that the elections are not held on the same day. I noticed in the strong desire of the noble Earl opposite, Lord Dartmouth, that all elections should be held on the same day, a sign of grace which I was very glad to observe on the Benches opposite. As I say, we do not like plural voting, but if it exists, as it does exist, it may be argued that it is a hardship that a particular set of plural voters who have a qualification in one London borough where they live and another qualification in another borough where their businesses are carried on should lose their vote. Admitting for the purposes of argument that that is a hardship, surely it is an infinitely smaller hardship than that of the man who loses his vote altogether because there is no successive occupation in London. I do not see, hardship for hardship, how it is possible to compare the two, and that seems to me to be a complete defence of our measure as we bring it in.<lb/>
The time may come, as we hope it will from our point of view, when there will be no plural voting, and until that time does come noble Lords opposite have a right to point out what appears to them to be a hardship; but if we are to be told that we must wait until all the historical anomalies of our electoral law can be swept away in one measure, I doubt nobody's good faith, but I cannot believe that anybody who takes such a view can be seriously anxious that any kind of electoral reform should be instituted in any way. The noble Earl who moved the rejection of the measure pointed out how simple it would be to make voting easy for everybody by introducing a registration Bill. The noble Earl must know, I am sure, and noble Lords opposite know, that there is no subject more baffling and more difficult, and which has given more trouble to those who have studied the question, than the problem of how to get a really reasonable system of Parliamentary registration. The noble Earl said, amid some applause from his own friends, that everybody would be in favour of such a system. Noble Lords opposite had ten years of office, not altogether overburdened
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0271"/>
<col>529</col>
as we think with fruitful legislation, and they might have devoted some part of that ten years in considering this question of registration. If they did not do so, no doubt it was partly owing to the difficulty and the complexity of the subject.<lb/>
My Lords, I need say no more. I greatly regret the conclusion at which noble Lords opposite have arrived, and I cannot help thinking that reflection might induce some of your Lordships to wonder whether you</membercontribution></p>

<quote>2.&#x2014;(1) Any oath may be administered and taken in the form and manner following:&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>The person taking the oath shall hold the New Testament, or, in the case of a Jew, the Old Testament, in his uplifted hand and shall say or repeat after the officer administering the oath the words "I swear by Almighty God that &#x2026;", followed by the words of the oath prescribed by law.</quote>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02177"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member>, in moving to insert at the end of subsection (1) of Clause 2 "but omitting any further words of imprecation or calling to witness," said he was
<col>532</col>
anxious to take the opinion of their Lordships' House upon the Amendment, and to know especially what the view was of the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chief Justice, whose experience naturally was so great as to render his advice on an Amendment of the kind of particular value to His Majesty's Government. There was in one or two quarters of the House considerable feeling with regard to the words "So help me God&#x0021;" which come at the end of the oath. Those words had entered into the current phraseology of the nation in a way in which the other words of the oath had not done, and to a great many people they constituted a most important part of it. He could not help feeling if those words were inserted in the oath that they did not really bear the strict meaning they ought to bear, being really more in the nature of an imprecation than of a prayer. It was not very easy to argue such things, and it was a case in which His Majesty's Government desired to follow the opinion of the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02178">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line 14, after 'law' to insert 'but omitting any further words of imprecation or calling to witness.'"&#x2014;(<i>Earl Beauchamp.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02179"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said he attached very little importance to the retention of the words in question, but thought that His Majesty's Government had made a great step in advance in the Bill by putting the words "I swear by Almighty God" into the mouth of the witness himself. With regard to the words "So help me God," he was inclined to think that those words meant "God help me if I do not tell the truth," but of course what they were really taken to mean was somewhat doubtful. It might also be considered important that the words had formed part of the oath for a considerable
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0273"/>
<col>533</col>
time, but he repeated that personally he did not attach any importance to their retention. At the same time if there was no strong feeling and desire to omit them, probably His Majesty's Government would allow them to remain. He attached much more importance to the witness himself using the words in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02180"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> was doubtful whether he had any right to intervene in a matter of the kind, but as their Lordships had been invited to express their lay opinions on the subject, it seemed to him that it would be a great pity to leave out the words in question. No doubt their meaning was ambiguous, but he was pretty certain that a large number of people took them in the sense of invoking Divine assistance to enable them to do what, after all, was not a perfectly simple matter in many cases&#x2014;to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and the words having been in the form of the oath for so many years and a good many people taking them in the sense he had indicated, he could not help feeling that it would be a somewhat serious thing to omit them. Therefore, as there appeared to be no strong feeling on the part of the Lord Chief Justice against their retention, he would submit that it would be better to retain them. That was the safest course. He could not see that their retention did any harm, whereas their omission might possibly do harm.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02181"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> supported what had just fallen from the noble Duke behind him. The words in question had been part of the oath in every Court of the land for a very long time, and it would be a great pity to remove them, especially after what had been said by the Lord Chief Justice that there was no strong feeling against their retention.</p>

<title>RAILWAY ENTERPRISES IN CHINA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02195"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. In view of Germany's assertion of rights to participate on equal terms in the construction and financing of railways in the Yang-tsze Provinces, whether His Majesty's Government recognise German claims to an exclusive position in mines and railways in Shantung.</li>
<li>2. Similarly, whether Russian financiers having intimated their intention of participating in railway enterprises in the Yang-tsze Valley, the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1899 with regard to railway enterprise in China has been abrogated, and whether in that case British enterprise is in a position to claim equal opportunities in the region North of the Great Wall.</li>
<li>3. Whether it is not advisable to determine the geographical limits within which the Japanese Government is entitled to veto or intervene in such measures as the Chinese Government may desire to take for the development of Western Manchuria and Mongolia.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02196">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in rising to put to His Majesty's Government the Questions which stand in my name, I crave that indulgence which your Lordships have so frequently shown in the past to those who address this House for the first time. Your Lordships will observe that the first two Questions on the Paper concern the continuance of what is known as the Spheres of Influence Policy in China. I do not propose, particularly at this late hour, to occupy the time of the House by discussing that policy, still less would I venture to criticise the foreign policy of His Majesty's Government. I would merely venture to suggest to your Lordships that conditions in China having so completely changed since the Spheres of Influence Policy was inaugurated, the time may now have come when the position of this country in these matters should be reconsidered. Your Lordships will no doubt remember that a debate took place in this House in the spring of 1898 on the question of defining the British and German spheres of influence in China, and that in the following September the British and German banks concerned in the financing of railways in China passed resolutions which were laid on the Table of your Lordships' House defining the respective limits of the spheres within which each should undertake such construction. Your
<col>536</col>
Lordships are no doubt aware that German financiers have for some time past been competing with British financiers in the Yang-tsze Valley, the British sphere of influence. I am further informed that the German syndicate has notified the British group that so far as the Yang-tsze Valley is concerned the agreement between those two groups made in 1898 is now at an end. I therefore venture to ask His Majesty's Government whether the British syndicates have received authority to cancel the arrangement with regard to the German sphere of influence in the province of Shantung.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02197">With regard to the second Question which I have placed upon the Paper, very much the same state of affairs exists. By an exchange of notes between Great Britain and Russia, signed on the 28th of April, 1899, this country engaged not to seek for any concessions for railway construction north of the Great Wall of China in return for a similar engagement from Russia in regard to the Yang-tsze Valley. Your Lordships no doubt will have observed that Russian financiers have recently intimated their intention of participating with others in the concessions for and in the financing of railway construction within the latter region. I therefore venture to ask His Majesty's Government whether the Convention of 1899 has been abrogated, and whether in that case British enterprise is in a position to claim equal opportunities north of the Great Wall?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02198">I now turn to the last Question, and here I find myself at once on somewhat delicate ground, with more than a risk of being considered <i>l'enfant terrible</i> of this House. I need not weary your Lordships with tales of atrocities which, albeit contrary to the wishes of the Japanese authorities, have none the less occurred under their rule, nor need I touch on the merits or demerits of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, an arrangement now, perhaps, not so popular among British residents in the Ear East as could be wished. I would, however, refer your Lordships to the preamble of that Agreement, which states that one of the objects of the Articles that follow is&#x2014;
<quote>"the preservation of the common interests of all Powers in China by insuring the independence and integrity of the Chinese Empire and the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations in China,"</quote>
and to Article IV. of the Treaty of Portsmouth
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0275"/>
<col>537</col>
between Japan and Russia, which states that the two Powers&#x2014;
<quote>"reciprocally engage not to obstruct any general measures common to all countries which China may take for the development of the commerce and industry of Manchuria."</quote>
Your Lordships will remember that the Japanese Government objected to an extension of the Chinese Northern Railway from Shin-min-tun, a town about forty miles west of Mukden, to Fakumen&#x2014;due north of Shin-min-tun&#x2014;on the grounds that it would be parallel to and competing with the South Manchurian Railway. I think it will surprise some of your Lordships almost as much as it did me when I was out there this summer to hear that the sites of these two railways are thirty-five miles apart and separated by the Liao River, a stream as wide at Shin-min-tun as the Thames at Windsor. It is hardly necessary to add that the trade of Fakumen, a town of 40,000 inhabitants, and of the surrounding district does not find its way to the South Manchurian Railway, which incidentally without it has been compelled, owing to the growing export trade of Manchuria, to double its line to Port Arthur. I do not know how far His Majesty's representatives in Japan, who certainly do not err as a whole on the side of partiality to British and Chinese aspirations, have advised His Majesty's Government to support vetos on railway construction, but certainly an influential supporter in this country of Japan wrote recently that even a railway constructed from Shan-hai-kwan, where the Great Wall of China runs into the sea, to Tsitsihar on the Trans-Siberian Railway, 168 miles west of Harbin, must be considered as a line running parallel to and in competition with the South Manchurian Railway, a line which with the exception of a few miles at either end will run entirely outside Manchuria through Mongolia, and about 150 miles from the South Manchurian Railway. It is obvious that there is considerable difference of opinion as to the limits within which a railway may be considered parallel to and competing with another in this region.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02199">There is a growing party in Japan who have a feeling that Manchuria should be ear-marked to Japan as a result of the war. Under the wise and guiding hand of the late Prince Ito, a Statesman who perhaps will occupy a place unequalled by any other in the history of our times, that party was kept in check. By a
<col>538</col>
dastardly crime which the whole civilised world abhors, and particularly the friends of Korea, this country joins in mourning with Japan, for whom he did so much, the loss of that great man. By such an untoward event the check which his great influence imposed in the past upon all wild policy has thus unfortunately been removed. Other nations have cast their eyes on the rich and fertile province of Manchuria, and His Majesty's Government may in the not far distant future be called upon to decide how far this country is to support Japan in any opposition she may make to a concession for railway construction in this region. The time may now fast be approaching when His Majesty's Government may be called upon to decide how far this country will support Japan in any veto or interference she may make to measures tending to the development of Western Manchuria and Mongolia undertaken by other Powers than herself. If we wait till these question's arise, we may find ourselves between the horns of a dilemma&#x2014;either to oppose Great Powers such as the United States of America, to whom we are bound by every tie of sentiment, of friendship, and of community of interests in the Far East, and to be accused of suddenly relinquishing the open door policy in China, which this country has so long advocated, or to be accused of suddenly leaving our ally in the lurch at the very moment when she might be most in need of our support. I venture to suggest that if this country makes known its position in regard to these matters now when affairs in the Far East appear to be in a happily quiescent state we shall avoid finding ourselves in this somewhat embarrassing position. It is for these reasons that I venture to ask His Majesty's Government how far Great Britain will support Japan in this particular matter. In conclusion, I have to thank your Lordships for the more than kind way in which you have listened to my remarks, and to apologise to the House for having occupied so much of your valuable time. I beg to ask His Majesty's Government the Questions that stand in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02200"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Earl, Lord Stanhope, will allow me to express the pleasure which I am sure it gives the whole House and myself in particular, as an old friend of many members of his family, to see him taking that part in the Debates of your Lordships' House which we like to see
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0276"/>
<col>539</col>
taken by one who bears his distinguished Parliamentary name; and I hope that the Questions which he has put to His Majesty's Government to-night may be the forerunner, I will not say of many more Questions, because Governments are glad not to be asked Questions, but of frequent participations on his part in the discussions in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The noble Earl has asked three Questions. As regards the first, he asks whether His Majesty's Government recognise German claims to an exclusive position in mines and railways in Shantung. The answer to that is that His Majesty's Government have not given the German Government any assurance in that sense. The second Question which the noble Earl asks is with regard to the participation of Russian financiers in the Yang-tsze Valley. There the case is of a somewhat different character. The proposed participation by the Russians in railway enterprise in the Yang-tsze Valley is confined to a loan, which is not secured by any mortgage on the line, and that loan does not appear to contravene the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1899. I ought to add that we do not anticipate that British participation in railway enterprises north of the Great Wall of China on similar terms to those on which the Russians are engaged in the Yang-tsze Valley would occasion any protest on the part of the Russian Government. Of course it is important to remember in considering all these matters&#x2014;and the noble Earl very properly drew attention to it&#x2014;the great change which has taken place in the condition of affairs in China since the two Agreements to which he alluded were made, and that all new railways in China henceforth will be under the control of the Chinese Government. As regards the third Question, the noble Earl, I think, was conscious that he was treading on somewhat risky ground, and I am afraid I cannot follow him into the very interesting matters which he raised in putting his Question. As the matter stands&#x2014;the noble Earl, I think, will agree, and I have no doubt noble Lords opposite will agree also&#x2014;it is one entirely for arrangement between the respective Governments of China and Japan; and I am afraid I can give the noble Earl no more satisfaction as regards that Question than these very brief words.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02206"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will see on looking at this Bill, the object of this very simple measure. There were unfortunately, some riots in Liverpool a short time ago, and it is thought desirable that the Commissioner who is to be appointed to inquire into the circumstances of the riots and the conduct of the police during that time should have certain special powers. The whole of the powers conferred by statute on the Metropolitan Police Commission of 1906 are conferred upon this Commissioner, including the power of compelling the production of documents and the punishment of persons guilty of contempt. It is very desirable that this inquiry should take place without any delay, and therefore at a later stage of the proceedings I shall move the suspension of the Standing Order in order that the Bill may go through its subsequent stages at this sitting.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02211"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The Motion of the noble Earl is a very strong measure. The suspension of all our Standing Orders in order to pass a Bill through has only been done in recent years by the practice of your Lordships in cases of great emergency. I do not know what the difference would be to the noble Earl if the Bill were passed to-day or next week, but there does not appear to be any compelling reason why we should suspend the Standing Order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02212"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The question of suspending the Standing Order is not at present before your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02214"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the noble Marquess does not quite understand the forms of the House, and though I am out of order perhaps I may explain. If we now negative the Committee stage and the Standing Order is suspended it will then be possible to proceed to the Third Reading and pass the Bill. That is the usual way in which Bills are treated when it is necessary to ask your Lordships to pass a Bill in this unusual manner. Since the noble Marquess has started the discussion I may irregularly follow him and state that there are thought to be considerable reasons for expediting this inquiry. In inquiries of this kind, in which political and religious passions are involved, it is very desirable that they should take place as soon as possible, as the witnesses would probably be better able to give their evidence before a considerable time had elapsed. There is, however, no immediate hurry, and if the noble Marquess wishes I will put it off till to-morrow or Thursday, in order to give him time to consider it, although I am afraid it will put off for some time the giving of the Royal Assent.</membercontribution></p>

I may mention that there is a good precedent for the step which the Government are asking your Lordships to take in this case. I refer to the precedent which was quoted and accepted in the case of the Metropolitan Police Commission Act, 1906, when the same procedure was adopted.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MINES EIGHT HOURS ACT.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02222"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Lord Steward whether he can state what decrease in the output of coal has occurred since the Mines Eight Hours Act came into operation, and whether His Majesty's Government still contemplate introducing an amending Bill during the present Session. In putting this question I am afraid that there is very little probability of obtaining a satisfactory answer, because the noble Earl is pretty sure to say there are no official statistics available at the present moment. So far as my information goes with regard to the working of this particular Act I find that, while in the Yorkshire collieries, where the hours were already short, no special effect has been felt, in Lancashire the average reduction amounts to something like ten per cent., and I believe that that figure applies also to portion of the Midlands and South Wales. In addition, I am informed that the hewers are earning from 9<i>d</i>. to 10<i>d</i>. a day less than
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0278"/>
<col>543</col>
they did before the Act was passed. Notwithstanding the efforts on both sides to make the Act work smoothly, serious difficulties have arisen in various parts of the country, and grave strikes have been averted with great difficulty. This Act, which was intended to be so beneficent, has, as a matter of fact, shown itself so inconvenient and unpopular that when a prominent member of His Majesty's Government was seeking re-election not long ago in the Cleveland Division he was obliged in order to retain his seat to promise an amending Act. In view of this unprecedented event in our history of a Minister promising to undo the work of his Government I asked in this House when the amending Bill was going to be brought in, and the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack assured me that it was going to be a very small measure and would be brought in at an early date and, he understood, with the general consent of both employers and employed. In fact he rather implied that it would be a Bill of such a universally popular character that it would be impossible even for me to find anything to object to in it. I want to know what has become of that Bill. I am informed, although it sounds almost incredible, that when it was drafted the Labour leaders in another place at once announced that they would have nothing to say to it whatever, and thereupon the Bill was dropped and nothing more has been heard of it. I now wish to repeat the question, and perhaps the noble Earl will be able to clear up the mystery that surrounds it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02223"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Earl the Lord Steward replies I should like to ask a supplementary question on the same subject. I do not know whether the noble Earl has any statistics, but I should imagine that it is quite impossible for any available statistics to have serious value. There have been very great difficulties in bringing this important new legislation into working order, and those difficulties have undoubtedly tended for the moment to decrease the output. I do not know whether the noble Earl is in a position to answer the question or not, but if he has any really serious body of statistics I should like to ask whether the Act has increased the cost of working by 5s. or 10s. a ton, as was stated would be the case by the Coal Consumers' League, of which the noble Lord opposite was president.</membercontribution></p>
<col>544</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02224"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, dealing first with the interrogation of the noble Lord behind me, I think the question whether the Act has increased the cost of working by 5s. or 10s. a ton would be more properly addressed to the noble Lord the president of the Coal Consumers' League.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02225"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: I don't know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02226"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: At the time that the Bill was under discussion a good deal of scepticism was expressed by members of your Lordships' House as to whether that forecast was likely to prove correct, and it was not one that the noble Lord himself was inclined to support with any degree of confidence. With regard to the general question put to me by the noble Lord opposite, he has prophesied correctly that no official information is available at present as to the output of coal during the current year. The returns are not required to be made up until the end of the year, and when received will only show the total output for the whole year, without distinguishing between the six months before the passing of the Act and the subsequent six months. The Secretary of State, however, has consulted the Inspectors of Mines, and they have reported that there have been more or less generally in England and Wales some decrease in the output since July 1 last. That decrease appears in some cases to amount to as much as ten per cent. or more, but these cases are very exceptional. The average decrease is a great deal lower. In Scotland the Inspector reports that there has been little or no decrease at all. The inspectors point out that in addition to the restriction of hours there are other causes which have tended to the restriction of output; in particular the general depression of trade has influenced a good many industries, and also, in the second place, some strikes and difficulties with the men, which were naturally to be expected before they were able to adjust themselves to the new conditions. Therefore, at the present time it is quite impossible to estimate the real effect of the restriction of hours on output.<lb/>
With regard to the second part of the noble Lord's speech, I am afraid I am quite unable to recognise in it anything like the Bill which has been introduced in another place. The description which the noble Lord gave of the Bill as having been promised by the late Under Secretary for the Home Department with the object of undoing the work of the Eight Hours
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0279"/>
<col>545</col>
Mines Act was somewhat fanciful. If he would look up a fuller report of what occurred, I think he would find that the amending Bill was only intended to deal with one very small part of the question&#x2014;whether the men might go to work at an earlier hour on Saturday morning in order to get the full advantage of their Saturday half-holiday. That Bill which has been introduced has been blocked by representatives of the Miners' Federation, and, therefore, it is impossible to say whether it will proceed any further this session, but the Government do not at present contemplate introducing another amending Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02227"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: I remember that in the course of the debate on the Mines Eight Hours Bill in your Lordships' House some allusion was made to a possible rise of ten shillings a ton in the cost of working, but I am sure I am right in saying that none of your Lordships who took part in the debate adopted that, figure. I recollect speaking upon the matter myself, and I am pretty certain that what I said at the time was that most of the best authorities on the subject thought there would be some rise, but that they could not say how much. I think they put it at more like 2<i>s</i>. a ton. That, I think, is what happened.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02239"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> moved to amend Clause 2 so as to provide that female asylum officers should be eligible for superannuation allowances on reaching the age of fifty, instead of fifty-five years. This was, he said, an Amendment that he had every intention of moving at an earlier stage of the Bill, but owing to a miscalculation of time on his part it did not appear on the Paper at the Report stage. It was something in the nature of a compromise. Their Lordships would remember that originally in the Bill it was provided that all officers should be eligible for superannuation at the age of fifty years, but owing to a little opposition on the part of Lord Belper, rather on the ground of economy and on behalf of the ratepayers of whose interests the noble Lord was so faithful a guardian, the age was altered to fifty-five years. But it was felt that in the case of women the age should be fifty years. The object of his Amendment was to enable women after long and arduous service to be superannuated at the age of fifty. He thought their Lordships would agree that female officers should be entitled to retire
<col>548</col>
at the age of fifty. Their temperament was not of such a robust character as that of male servants, and it was only fair that this preference of five years should be given to women.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02240">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line 21, after the word 'old' to insert the words 'or in the case of females not less than fifty years old.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Shaftesbury.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02241"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> said he not only accepted the noble Earl's Amendment, but he did so with pleasure. It was with the greatest regret that he had accepted Lord Belper's Amendment in Committee substituting the age of fifty-five for both men and women. The case of women in this connection was stronger than that of men, as was shown by the evidence before the Committee, from which it appeared that the number of breakdowns among women attendants greatly exceeded the number among men. He hoped the noble Earl would press the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02242"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member> was sorry it was impossible for His Majesty's Government to accept this very serious alteration in the scheme of the Bill. It was serious not only in the way of making a considerable additional charge on the rates, but still more serious in the sense that it would introduce a wholly new principle into the pension schemes of this country. There was no pension scheme in which any distinction was made between men and women, either in this country or, he thought, in any other country. Their Lordships would probably agree that when a woman had reached the age of fifty years she was just as well able to look after lunatics for another five years as a warder who had reached the same age. He did not see that the charge of female lunatics was more arduous than the charge of male lunatics, and in view of the new principle in pension legislation which the Amendment would introduce he hoped their Lordships would not accept it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02243"><member>LORD BELPER</member> reminded the House that his Amendment was accepted without a Division and by the general consent of the House, and though the noble Lord in charge of the Bill now said that he accepted it with great regret, at all events he veiled that regret very satisfactorily at the time, because he did not speak against the Amendment. He (Lord Belper) had listened to hear what the arguments were
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0281"/>
<col>549</col>
in favour of making the proposed distinction between male and female officers. He anticipated that the noble Earl who moved the Amendment would point out that the lives of women were much shorter than those of men, or that they were not able at this period of their lives to do their duty in as efficient a way as men. Nothing of the sort, however, had been contended, and therefore he agreed with the noble Earl the Lord Steward that there was no case for the proposed distinction. The age of fifty-five was inserted as a compromise, and he thought the age was a fair one both as regarded men and women and should be allowed to stand.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02250"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> moved an Amendment in Clause 4&#x2014;which gave power to the visiting committee to grant a gratuity to the widow or children of an officer who, if he had not died in the service of the asylum, would have been qualified for a special superannuation allowance&#x2014;empowering the visiting committee to grant either a gratuity or an annual allowance. He said their Lordships would remember that a short discussion took place on Report upon this clause, and that the noble Lord below the Gangway, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, moved an Amendment, of which he had not given notice, to an Amendment which appeared on the Paper. Lord Clifford then moved to leave out the words "an annual allowance or," and, as he thought often happened in those circumstances, it was difficult for their Lordships, although they
<col>550</col>
accepted Lord Clifford's proposal, entirely to appreciate the full effect of an Amendment of that kind. His Majesty's Government, on consideration, were anxious to persuade their Lordships to reinsert these words in the Bill. The object, he thought, was quite clear. There were oases in which it was only fair that the visiting committee should have the power of giving not only a gratuity but also an annual allowance to these people. Their Lordships had already, in subsection (4) of Clause 2, given power to grant pensions to officers permanently incapacitated, and to ask their Lordships also to give an annual allowance as proposed in cases where officers had been killed was, after all, only a necessary consequence to the previous power, to which no objection was taken by the noble Lord below the Gangway. There very likely would arise a case in which a sum of money down would not be a sufficient recognition to make of an officer who had gallantly lost his life in the service of the visiting committee. He did not think they could anticipate that there would be many such cases. Only one or two had occurred in the whole year throughout the police force of the United Kingdom, and there would be even fewer under this Bill. He therefore hoped their Lordships would agree to the Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02252"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> said his objection to the words "annual allowance" was that they introduced an entirely new feature. The Bill up to the point when these words were proposed the other night limited its action entirely to a gratuity to widows and children and an annuity to the actual officers and servants. The Report stage was the first occasion upon which the subject of an annual allowance was brought up, and he then appealed to their Lordships whether in those circumstances it was not quite justifiable to call attention to so radical an innovation. The clause as it originally came to their Lordships' House provided that it should be competent for asylum managers to grant, at their discretion and on such terms as they thought fit, a gratuity to the widow and children of an established officer or servant who died whilst in the service of the asylum, and who, if he had retired at the time of his death, would have been entitled to a superannuation
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0282"/>
<col>551</col>
allowance. The Amendment to which he had objected, and which the noble Earl now proposed to reinsert, enabled the asylum authority to give to the widow and children of an officer or servant dying in the service of the establishment not merely a gratuity but a pension. It was called an annual allowance, but the limit was practically equal to the original pension granted in the case of the actual officer on being superannuated. He contended that that was an alteration in the principle of the Bill which it was not proper to introduce at so late a stage, and their Lordships had acquiesced with him in that sentiment. Now it was proposed to reinsert the words. He left the matter entirely in their Lordships' hands, but he must say that the innovation was a very serious one, and one that ought not to be introduced at a late stage of the Bill.</p>

by omitting the words "or appointed after the passing of this Act." The object of the Amendment was, he said, to provide that persons entering asylum service after the passing of this Act should pay a contribution to the pension fund of three per cent. instead of two per cent. of their salary. He admitted that it was not desirable to move Amendments at a late stage of the Bill which should have been moved earlier if it was possible to avoid it; but his attention had been called to the fact that while the benefits under this Bill were much more liberal than those under the Poor Law Officers' Superannuation Act, two per cent. was the same contribution as was paid by Poor Law officers under that Act. Therefore the effect would be that the surplus which had to be provided by the local authority would cause a heavier charge upon the rates than in the cases where the benefits were less and where the contribution was the same. He did not propose to interfere in any way with the amount that the present officers had to contribute, but it was proposed by his Amendment to increase the amount that future officers should contribute from two per cent. to three per cent. In the circumstances, considering that the benefits were considerable under the Bill and larger than under the Poor Law Officers' Superannuation Act, he thought it was only fair to make this small alteration.</p>

dealing with people who entered the service after the date of the passing of the Act. Therefore they were not taking away from anybody at present in the service of a visiting committee any privilege which he or she enjoyed at the present time. The scale of pensions provided in the Bill was so liberal that it was thought that three per cent. was not an unfair contribution to ask from these officers. The experience of the Metropolitan Police Fund and other funds was that large deficits had to be made up out of the rates. Therefore he thought three per cent. was not an unfair contribution to ask from future officers.</p>

Now this was another blow to be dealt to the Bill. By the Amendment the contribution was to be raised from two to three per cent. He felt it very difficult to accept the Amendment, even after what had been said on behalf of His Majesty's Government. Lord Belper had quoted the case of Poor Law officers, but the whole point of this Bill was that asylum officers were engaged in a dangerous profession, whereas Poor Law officers were not. After what had fallen from the noble Earl and the warnings he had received he was not going to press his opposition to the Amendment, but he desired to say that, though he had twice resisted an Amendment moved by Lord Donoughmore to the effect that the basis for calculating the pensions should be the last five years of service and not the last ten years of service, as in the Bill, he reserved to himself, if he did not resist the present Amendment, the right to accept Lord Donoughmore's Amendment later and substitute five years for ten years.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02266"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to insert, after Clause 12, the following new clause&#x2014;
<quote>13. Where, by virtue of any award made under section sixty-two of the Local Government Act, 1888, or section two hundred and forty-four of the
<col>554</col>
Lunacy Act, 1890, any liability is imposed on any county council or the council of any county borough to contribute to any superannuation allowances granted to any officer or servant or servant of an asylum, such liability shall, unless and until otherwise provided by subsequent award, agreement, or otherwise, continue in the same manner and to the same extent as if this Act had not been passed, and any sums payable under any such award in respect of any such liability shad be paid to the visiting committee of any such asylum in lieu of the county council or the council of any county borough to whom the same would otherwise be payable.</quote>
He said he was sorry to trouble their Lordships with such an obscure Amendment at this stage, but it was owing to its obscurity that it had not been raised before. The point to be met was this. Let them assume that a corporation and a county council owned an asylum together and that the asylum became too small and the county council and corporation separated. There were duties to give pensions on both local authorities, and consequently under the existing law awards were made under which, let them say, the county council had to pay to the corporation such sums as would enable the whole of the pensions due to be paid. Under this Bill the visiting committee and not the local authority were made the responsible authority for giving pensions, and therefore awards which had been made and which obliged one local authority to pay another local authority were vitiated by the visiting committee being made the authority. The county council might refuse to pay the corporation under the award because the visiting committee was the authority, and it was to remedy this that his proposed new clause was drafted. He was afraid his Amendment was not correct as it stood, but he would not trouble their Lordships to make any change in the Amendment had he not the authority both of the Lunacy Commissioners and of His Majesty's Government in the proposed amendment to the Amendment which he was about to suggest. Clause 19 of the Bill provided that repeals under this Bill should not affect the payment of any superannuation allowance granted before the commencement of the Act. Therefore existing pensions and the machinery under which they were paid in this peculiar case were safeguarded, but what were not safeguarded were future payments. He therefore hoped their Lordships would insert this clause. But as the words "such liability" would refer to existing pensions as well as to future pensions, he asked permission to amend the last five lines of his Amendment, so
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0284"/>
<col>555</col>
that, after the words "and to the same extent as if this Act had not been passed," the clause would run: "provided that any sums payable under any such award in respect of superannuation allowance granted under this Act shall be paid to the visiting committee of any such asylum in lieu of the county council or the council of any county borough to whom the same would otherwise be payable."</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02270"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the two Amendments standing in his name to Clause 14 were Amendments to which His Majesty's Government attached a good deal of importance. As the clause stood at present, it would enable asylum officers to appeal to the Secretary of State not merely as to the amount of the pensions to which they were legally entitled, but also on questions whether the visiting committee had treated them fairly in cases where the amount of the pension was left to the discretion of the visiting committee. He thought when the visiting committee were given a discretion of this kind it was not desirable that there should always be a power of appeal to the Secretary of State. This was one of those matters which they might safely leave the local authority to deal with. His Amendment would have the effect of enabling an asylum servant to appeal as to the amount of pension to which he was entitled, but would
<col>556</col>
not permit him to appeal on questions as to the way in which the visiting committee had exercised a discretion now entrusted to them by law.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02273"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> moved an Amendment to Clause 15. The clause ran&#x2014;
<quote>15. The salary or wages and emoluments of an established officer or servant shall, for the purpose of computing the amount of a superannuation allowance or gratuity, be calculated according to the average amount of his salary or wages and emoluments during the ten years ending on the quarter day which immediately precedes the day on which he ceases to hold his office or employment, or, in the case of an officer or servant with less than ten years service, on the average amount during his whole period of service; and the expression "emoluments" includes all fees, poundage and other payments made to any established officer or servant as such for his own use, and also the money valve of any apartments, rations, or other allowances in kind appertaining to his office or employment.</quote>
<quote>The annual money value of all such fees, poundage and other payments, apartments, rations, or other allowance in kind shall be set out in a schedule to be prepared by the visiting committee of every asylum and affixed in a conspicuous place in the asylum.</quote>
The noble Earl proposed to leave out "ten years" ["be calculated according to the average amount of his salary or wages and emoluments during the ten years"] and to substitute "five years." He said this was the Amendment to which Lord Monk Bretton had already referred, and which provided that the pensions were to be calculated on the average salary of the last five years instead of on the average salary for the last ten years, as in the Bill. He had moved this Amendment twice before, and would not have ventured to bring it again before the House but for the fact that the circumstances were entirely altered by the Amendment raising the contribution from two per cent. to three per cent. He claimed that the fact that the contribution had been so raised did very much increase the necessity for this Amendment. He would not go again over the ground which he had covered previously in moving the Amendment, but would merely remind their Lordships that Mr. Byrne, of the Home Office, had very strongly supported the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0285"/>
<col>557</col>
period of five years in his evidence before the Select Committee, and in doing so he was merely recommending to the Select Committee the following of precedents. Those precedents were a great many more in number than he was aware of when he moved the Amendment in Committee, and he had in his hand a list of six Superannuation Acts in which the period of five years had been adopted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02274">Their Lordships would remember that almost the sole ground upon which the Amendment was resisted at previous stages was that the cost to the rates would be too great, in view of the very small contribution&#x2014;two per cent.&#x2014;which was to be made by the officers. That contribution had now been raised to three per cent. and he claimed that that was a very strong reason why the period should now be reduced. A case had been drawn up in the offices of the London County Council which would show how the proposal in the Bill and the proposal in his Amendment would work. The ten years average was not likely to affect a higher official, who would always have been drawing his maximum salary for ten years prior to his retirement; his pension would, therefore, not be affected whether it was calculated on the average salary for his last five or ten years. But he was assured that if the Bill remained in its present form it would to a very large extent affect the pensions of the lower officers, men to whom a small difference in pension was much more serious than it would be in the case of the higher officials.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02275">He was assured that the following case illustrated what would happen. A male attendant entered the London service, and was classed at first as a second-class attendant. He received, after six months probation, &#x00A3;31 a year, his salary rising by annual increments of &#x00A3;1 to &#x00A3;40; the officer was also, of course, allowed board, lodging and washing. Therefore, he took nine years to arrive at the maximum of a second-class attendant's wages, and he might remain in this position for many years awaiting a vacancy as a first-class, or what was known technically as a charge attendant. When he was thus appointed he commenced at &#x00A3;40 and proceeded by annual increments of &#x00A3;1 to &#x00A3;50. Therefore, the man joined, let him say, at twenty-five as a second-class attendant; he would reach his maximum pay as a second-class
<col>558</col>
attendant at thirty-four; he remained in that position for ten years, and was then made a charge attendant and did not reach his maximum of &#x00A3;50 until he was fifty-four years of age. At fifty-five he retired, and his pension for thirty years service was then calculated under the Bill on his average salary during his last ten years service. That average would work out at &#x00A3;46 8<i>s</i>., whereas the average for the previous five years would work out at &#x00A3;48 16<i>s</i>. In each case there would have to be added &#x00A3;39 for emoluments&#x2014;board, uniform, lodging, and washing. The pension would then work out at &#x00A3;51 4<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. on a ten years calculation, and at &#x00A3;52 13<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. on a five years calculation. The difference was a very small one to the authorities concerned, but the sum was by no means a negligible one to an officer drawing a pension of about &#x00A3;1 a week. Under the present London County Council scale this man's pension would be &#x00A3;59 6<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. Therefore, future officers were not going to be treated as well as past officers. He appealed to their Lordships to substitute five years for ten years. Five years was the period recommended by the Select Committee. He believed the period of ten years was absolutely without precedent. It certainly was contrary to the system under which the officials of whom he had been speaking at present served. The noble Earl the Lord Steward, in resisting Lord Shaftesbury's Amendment earlier in the evening, objected then to the introduction of a wholly new principle. He (Lord Donoughmore) was surprised but gratified to see that sign of Toryism in his noble friend opposite. He hoped he would retain it, and that His Majesty's Government would see their way not to oppose this Amendment.</p>

or ten years did not stand alone. They also had to consider the scale of pensions. Pensions for first-class officers were by this Bill based on a scale of fiftieths. In those circumstances it was thought not unfair that a period of ten years should be taken. If instead a scale of sixtieths had been inserted, then he thought there would have been a good deal to be said for the noble Earl's request that five years should be substituted. In the circumstances he was afraid the Government must stand by the provisions of the Bill as they stood. It had been suggested that, in view of the willingness of noble Lords who promoted</p>

That power was done away with in 1898, but the rights of existing officers were preserved.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02314"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: The figures in the Bill to which the Commons object were inserted by your Lordships after very careful consideration and after consultation with the burghs, and they were put in on the understanding that they covered practically the whole of the working-class houses in burghs. I therefore submit that we are entitled to some reason why the Government refuse to assent to our Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02315"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I shall be glad to give the Government's reasons; but when the matter was last before your Lordships it was fully discussed, and I thought I then described at length the position of the Government towards the noble Lord's proposals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02316"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: The figures now inserted in the House of Commons by order of the Government are not those which appeared in the original Bill. The Government had, I admit, gone a certain distance to meet us, because they no longer fix &#x00A3;26 as the limit; but I think that in this matter they might have given more consideration to Scottish opinion expressed clearly by the burghs of Scotland. I admit that the matter of rental is not a point which can be regarded as vital, but still it is
<col>564</col>
important, and I am sorry the Government should not have further considered the views that were put forward on behalf of the burghs in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02317"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not think it is at all clear that the Government have not further considered the views which the noble Lord and those who acted with him put forward. The Government have considered those views carefully. The complaint is that the Government have not accepted them; but, as the noble Lord admitted, we have made an approximation to his views. Nor can I admit that in one direction the Government have not been in touch with the burghs, or that the burghs are strongly dissatisfied with the change effected by the Commons Amendment. This change was made in the Bill some days ago. The burghs are by no means reluctant to approach the Scottish Office on other matters. But no substantial objection has been taken to what is now proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02318"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: It is all very well for the noble Lord to say that the burghs have taken no substantial objection, but your Lordships must remember that this Bill emanated originally from Glasgow and the West of Scotland and that all the other burghs in Scotland were opposed to the views taken by Glasgow. The words "five hundred thousand" population meant Glasgow alone, and the reason why that was inserted was that Edinburgh wished for &#x00A3;15, as also did Dundee and Aberdeen, and I know that Aberdeen wishes for the figure of &#x00A3;15 at this moment. The Government propose to make a different arrangement. They propose that in all burghs which have a population of over 50,000 the yearly rental or value should be &#x00A3;21, and the effect of that is to include the five largest burghs which are known as the scheduled burghs&#x2014;Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and Greenock. Of those, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Aberdeen, if they had their own way, would prefer the figure of &#x00A3;15. But besides those scheduled burghs there are four others&#x2014;Govan, Patrick, Paisley, and Leith. I admit, if you are going to have a figure of &#x00A3;21 in Glasgow, that Govan and Patrick being adjacent there are possible inconveniences in having a different figure there, and to that extent there is something to be said for what the noble Lord proposes. It is for that reason, and not because I think
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0289"/>
<col>565</col>
these figures really meet the wishes of these towns, that I hope in the circumstances the Commons Amendment will not be opposed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02320"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I move, with regard to the next Amendment, substituting "twenty-one" for "twenty," that this House agree with the Commons in the said Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02322"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: This is a very small and, <i>prima facie</i>, peddling Amendment, and surely the noble Lord should give us some reason for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02323"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: I was in Aberdeen only yesterday and saw several gentlemen who are interested in this Bill, and they were unanimously of opinion that &#x00A3;21 would include houses very much over what could be regarded as working-class houses. Why has the figure been changed? There must be some reason for it, and I think the noble Lord should state it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02324"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: There is no secret about this, and I shall be glad to give such explanation as I can. This matter was carefully considered in another place, and it was pressed upon the Government that the figure of &#x00A3;21 would be a more convenient figure than that of &#x00A3;20. In-habited house duty is levied on houses of a certain rental, and &#x00A3;21 would safely cover the limit desired. That is the reason for the change. The Government, as the noble Lord knows, were even reluctant to come down so low as &#x00A3;21, particularly in the case of Glasgow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02325"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: The explanation is, in my opinion, a lame one, but I do not think we shall consider the point a vital one.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02333"><i>The Commons disagree to these Amendments for the following reasons</i>:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02334"><i>Because if the arrangements for the collection of municipal rates proposed in Clause</i> 12 <i>as amended by the Lords are required for the purpose of facilitating the object of the Bill, viz., the creation of a system of short lets, similar arrangements are equally necessary for the collection of poor rates, education rates, and other rates levied by parish councils, and for the collection of water rates.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02335"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I move that this House do not insist on the first Amendment to which the Commons have disagreed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02336">Moved, That this House do not insist upon the said Amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Pentland.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02337"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: We have had no reason yet for the disagreement to our Amendment striking out "a parish council." We struck those words out on the ground that they ought not to have been inserted at all, because this was a Bill which had to do with house letting and municipal rates, whereas parish councils have to do with poor rates. This Amendment is a very important one. It raises the question whether the parish councils, which collect the parish rates, are to be put on the same footing as the municipalities which collect the municipal rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02338"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I moved the motion formally because I did not imagine for one moment that the noble Earl would desire any explanation on behalf of the Government as to the treatment of these particular words. This has been discussed at every stage of the Bill, and the Government's attitude has never varied in this or the other House. I was considerate of the time of your Lordships in merely moving that this House should not insist on its Amendments in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02339"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Lord does not give any reasons but merely moves the Motion, I presume that the reasons are those which are printed on the Paper&#x2014;namely, that the Commons disagree to our Amendments because if the arrangements for the collection of municipal rates proposed in Clause 12 as amended by your Lordships are required for the purpose of facilitating the object of the Bill&#x2014;viz., the creation of a system of short lets&#x2014;similar arrangements are equally necessary for the collection of poor rates, education rates, and other rates levied by parish councils, and for
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0290"/>
<col>567</col>
the collection of water rates. Therefore your Lordships will see that our Amendments are objected to by the Commons on the ground of rates, and for no other reason. In proposing to place parish councils upon the same footing as municipalities your Lordships are being asked to make a very important change in the law. At the present time municipalities collect their rates under Section 345 of the Burgh Police Act, and when the occupier has been asked to pay his rates and has failed to do so, then recourse is had to the owner. Therefore a municipality at this moment has the right ultimately to have recourse to the owner. A parish council is in a different position altogether. They collect the occupier's rates from the occupier and from the occupier alone, and if he does not pay the rate is lost. Therefore your Lordships will see that you are asked, not merely to place the parish councils on the same footing as municipalities, but to give parish councils a most important power which they do not now possess&#x2014;a drastic power of applying to the owners. The noble Lord urged the case for the parish councils very strongly when the Bill was before us, and your Lordships took the view, which I adhere to, that in giving this power to parish councils the law was being altered in a way in which you do not propose to alter it for anybody else. For the first time they will have access to the owner. We on this side are anxious to go as far as we possibly can with the Government in facilitating the collection of rates and thereby increasing, as we hope, the number of private arrangements; and although we are not unwilling to accede to this great change, it is on the understanding that the conditions which govern the franchise at present are not in any way interfered with. I do not know which will be the most convenient way of taking the question. Perhaps I had better wait until my Amendment is reached. Therefore while not at this stage opposing the reinsertion of the words "parish council" or the other Amendment, the noble Lord will understand that we do so on the distinct understanding that we are going hereafter to limit the matter to the question of the collection of rates&#x2014;the only reason given by the House of Commons for their disagreement.</membercontribution></p>

</ol></quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02400">The noble Earl said: I think it will be for the convenience of the House that I should take these three subsections separately. The object of the first subsection is this. I think it will frequently happen that an owner, where he has an occupier whom he can trust, will make a private arrangement with him that he will pay his rates; and if the owner neglects to do so, the occupier will receive due notice of this
<col>574</col>
neglect, and then it will be in his power to preserve his franchise by paying the rates. Then, of course, he will be entitled to deduct the amount from what he has to pay to the owner. That is the meaning of my first subsection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02401"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think possibly it would be better at this point that I should say a word on what I understand to be the cumulative effects of the noble Earl's proposals. It may be of use, I think, if I remind the House of the state in which this Bill originally left the House of Commons, and of the changes which have since been made in it in regard to the main matter which is in dispute between the Government and the Opposition. As the Bill originally left the House of Commons it contained provisions for compounding for all rates, including poor rates; and in regard to the effect upon the franchise it contained a definite provision that the non-payment by an owner of any assessment payable on behalf an occupier should not affect the occupier's right to be registered as a voter or to vote at any Parliamentary or other election.<lb/>
Your Lordships substituted a new clause for the clauses relating to rating which the Bill contained when it left the House of Commons. This new clause provides that in certain cases owners are to be liable for occupiers' rates; but by excluding in a prior clause of the Bill the parish council from the definition of "assessing authority" your Lordships removed the question of the Parliamentary franchise entirely from the scope of the discussion. Upon this I make two observations. The Government cannot assent to the implication of this exclusion&#x2014;namely, that the right to the Parliamentary franchise is properly based on personal payment of poor rate. And, apart from that question, which need not have been imported into this discussion, I wish to observe, in the second place, that by this exclusion of parish councils from the definition of "assessing authority," it was rendered impossible to adjust the interests of parish councils to the new system of short lets which this Bill seeks to introduce. The Government, naturally enough, I think, found themselves unable to accept the position that rates levyable by parish councils, which amount to nearly forty per cent. of the total of all rates, could be properly separated in treatment from other rates. They therefore, by the Amendments introduced on the Lords
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0294"/>
<col>575</col>
Amendments in the House of Commons, restored the parish council to the definition of "assessing authority," and amended the new Clause 12 in such a way as to make it clearly applicable to parish councils among other assessing bodies. The noble Earl this afternoon assented, with qualifications, to the restoration of the parish council to the category of assessing authorities.<lb/>
The question of the franchise still remained. Your Lordships by your Amendments had taken out of the Bill the provision safeguarding franchise rights as the Bill originally came before this House. The Commons did not press for the re-insertion of this provision, but they inserted instead a new Clause D, to which the noble Earl will presently take objection, the effect of which was to provide that when an owner pays occupiers' poor rates the payment is to cover successive occupations in the course of a year and to qualify the successive occupiers, so far as payment of poor rates is a qualification, for the exercise of the franchise. The effect of this provision is no doubt as in England, to enfranchise an occupier who may only have paid poor rate for part of the year&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02402"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: Or he may not have paid it at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02403"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Let me proceed. The effect of the provision is to enfranchise an occupier who may only have paid poor rate for part of the year in respect of the house which constitutes the qualification. That is precisely what is permitted under the existing law in England, and that is my answer to the noble Lord's interruption. A further question remained. Suppose the owner himself does not pay. In such a case the Government could not accept the position that the disqualification of the occupier should follow as a necessary consequence. They therefore introduced the closing words of the new Clause D, to which the noble Earl takes objection, providing for continuation of notices to occupiers of assessments in arrear, and they enabled the occupier to retain his franchise on payment of the rate which the owner had neglected to pay, and subsequently to recover the amount from the owner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02404"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will find that in paragraph (iii) of my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<col>576</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02405"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am aware of that, but I thought it better to review the whole field. The Government, in making these provisions, have copied as literally as circumstances would admit the provisions of the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869, which, as noble Lords who have followed this controversy well know, is the governing Statute in England; and if your Lordships will refer to the debates on the Bill you will find that the whole question now in dispute was discussed at length and a compromise effected on precisely the same basis as that which we now propose for Scotland, In 1869, as now, the Government were charged with introducing a Franchise Bill in disguise. I have repeatedly, in the discussions on this Bill, had an opportunity, which I have taken, of disavowing altogether the imputation that the Government had any intention in this matter of introducing a Franchise Bill. That charge is made now; it was made then in the case of England. But in spite of that, and in spite of the much greater interests involved in the application of this principle to England, the Bill to which I have referred passed. The position, therefore, is that your Lordships are denying to Scotland an advance in the law which Parliament forty years ago was willing to give, and did give, to those in precisely the same circumstances in England.<lb/>
I have only seen this series of Amendments proposed by the noble Earl to-day, and it is a little difficult for me and for local authorities in Scotland to appreciate fully, on such short notice, the effect of the changes which he proposes. As I understand it, however, his proposal amounts to this: that in no circumstances will he accept payment of rates by an occupier as a qualification for the franchise in respect of a particular house unless the occupier has paid a whole year's poor rate upon that house, notwithstanding he may only have occupied it for part of the year. I hope I am not misunderstanding the noble Earl's intention, because it is really the critical point of our differences. It is provided also that an owner is not to be called upon or be liable to pay any assessment on behalf of an occupier under the section until after the 20th day of June next following the imposition of the assessment. What will be the effect of this provision? I am not quite sure that I understand it. It is not quite clear, and anything I have to say
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0295"/>
<col>577</col>
now must, therefore, be subject to reconsideration; but it would seem that the effect will be that any occupier desiring to retain his franchise will be obliged, notwithstanding successive changes of occupation, to pay the entire poor rate for the house constituting the qualification, and that although he may have already paid his rates with his rent to the owner. For some months he may have been paying his poor rate with his rent in instalments. He may have to leave that house after having paid these instalments of poor rate with his rent. If he is to qualify for the franchise he will also have to pay the entire occupiers' poor rate in respect of that house for the year. That is the burden which the noble Earl's provisions seem to me to lay upon the occupier. I do not dogmatise upon the point, but that is what seems to me to be the position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02406"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to interrupt the noble Lord. But I understood we were going to discuss the three paragraphs in my new subsection in order, and for that reason I limited myself in what I said to paragraph (i). The noble Lord is now going into the whole matter. The intention of paragraph (ii) is to leave the law with regard to the franchise in the position that it is at this moment, and not to make any change. What I would point out is this, that if the change which the Government propose to make is made, it would be possible to call upon an owner, in default of payment by the occupier, to pay the poor rate, and thereby to qualify an occupier who might never repay him or might never pay any rate at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02407"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Of course, this is not a perfect world. The noble Lord has pointed out objections to the alteration, but the objections which he points out now were outweighed, in the opinion of Parliament, by the necessities and circumstances of the case in regard to England; and in 1869, as a solution of a controversy which had gone on for nearly three years, the Government, in spite of any such objections as the noble Earl has now pointed out, found themselves obliged, as a complement to any system of short lets for working-class houses, to make concurrent elasticity in this matter of the collection of rates. The effect of the rigidity which the noble Earl has insisted upon during the whole of these discussions is really to put as against the introduction of the short
<col>578</col>
let system in Scotland the whole penalty of disfranchisement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02408"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02409"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The effect of the noble Earl's provision is to apply the whole leverage of the desire to retain the franchise against the system of paying rates with rent, which the clause specially introduces in order to facilitate short lets. You therefore take away with one hand what you give with the other. It is also faulty in so far as it leaves in doubt what is to happen if the owner, notwithstanding the present proposals, does pay his poor rate before the 20th day of June. Will the occupier, or will be not, be disfranchised in that case? Possibly the noble Earl will tell us; but the Government's proposals have been perfectly clear on this point all along. The noble Earl has assumed throughout these discussions the opinion of local authorities in Scotland. He has alluded to-day to the position of Glasgow. I have this afternoon received from the Glasgow Corporation this telegram&#x2014;
<quote>"House Letting Bill, Glasgow Corporation desire in strongest terms to represent against proposal to be made in Lords by which owners cannot be called upon to pay till after 20th June next following imposition of assessment. This would hang up great part of rate collection till year following that for which assessment levied, involving some &#x00A3;300,000, and is unworkable.&#x2014;Town Clerk."</quote>
That is not a final opinion. In the first place, we are not quite clear as to the noble Earl's intention. In the second place, the Glasgow Corporation may well be in doubt as to the effect of the words which embody his intention. But there is the opinion of the Glasgow Corporation on the proposals which the noble Lord now puts forward. I have another telegram also, from the Town Clerk of Glasgow, to this effect&#x2014;
<quote>"House Letting Bill, It is thought here that the new clause to be proposed by Lord Camperdown would disfranchise&#x2014;</quote>
not would forbid the enfranchisement, but would disfranchise&#x2014;
<quote>large number of occupiers of small dwelling-houses."</quote>
On the whole, therefore, I must, on behalf of the Government, decline to agree with the changes which are row proposed in the Amendments made in this Bill in another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02410"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Lord object to the first paragraph of my proposed new subsection?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0296"/>
<col>579</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02411"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think my objection had better be to the whole of them, though there are differences in degree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02412"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland has dwelt largely on the English model. We are dealing here with a purely Scottish system, and I do not think it is possible to bring the English system forward as a direct model, as in many respects it does not apply to Scotland at all. In the first place, the noble Lord has altered the rental of houses in this Bill until they largely exceed the ordinary rental of compounded houses in England. The ordinary rental in England, with the exception of London, and, I think, Liverpool, is &#x00A3;13. Corresponding towns under this Bill will have a limit of rental of &#x00A3;21. But apart altogether from that, there is a very much stronger objection. The Act of 1869 was the result of compromise. Does the noble Lord opposite understand from his English advisers that compounding has worked successfully in England? Every authority who has reported upon compounding in England has reported against it, whilst Miss Octavia Hill, than whom no one knows more of the life of the working-classes in England, has declared the system to be wholly demoralising. Are we to take this worn-out, objectionable system from England, and apply it to a bran-new system of letting in Scotland? This Bill came forward nominally as a house-letting Bill. We have no difference with the Government on that point. But, in order to carry out his short-letting principle, the noble Lord has stated that he must have a compounding system. We disagree with that statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02413"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: May I point out that the noble Lord assents in a form to compounding?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02414"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: No, no. We went as far to compounding as it was possible for us to go, and framed the clause which is now in the Bill. This clause has nothing whatever to do with enfranchisement, and yet it carries out the noble Lord's idea of rate collection. But the Government refuse to accept this clause until they have added to it certain other clauses which would clearly enfranchise the occupiers throughout the country. We have tried to meet the noble Lord in every way, and we are now met with an objection
<col>580</col>
<i>in toto</i> to our clause unless it carries with it the principle of enfranchising those who do not pay the rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02415"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I confined myself in my remarks to paragraph (i) of my proposed new subsection. Shall I deal with the whole subsection in answer to the noble Lord's speech?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02416"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: If you please.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02417"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The object of the second paragraph is to prevent any change in the conditions which accompany the Scottish franchise. The law is at present that an occupier's rates must have been paid before June 20 if that occupier's name is to be on the roll. The occupier may himself pay; then he is on the roll; or he may make an arrangement with the house owner to pay the rates for him; that would be a perfectly legal payment, and the occupier's name would be on the roll. What we object to is that the owner should be compelled to pay the rates of a man in whom, very likely, he has no trust, with regard to whom, perhaps, all he knows is that he has not paid his rates, and thereby he is made to qualify that man for the register. It is that alone to which we object. And when the noble Lord opposite says we are attacking the system of short lets, I can only reply that the question of rates has no more to do with short lets than with the moon. We are proposing to give to the parish council a power of ultimate recourse against the owner which they do not at present possess; and, in order to meet the objections which the Glasgow Corporation have indicated in the telegram read out by the noble Lord, I will introduce in paragraph (ii) after the first "assessment," the words "imposed by a parish council." What we are attacking is the giving of power to parish councils to call upon owners to pay rates in order to qualify the occupiers. We do not wish in any way to diminish the powers of the municipalities. Indeed, as a matter of fact we do not diminish them, because municipalities need not collect under this clause; they can collect under Section 345 of the existing Act. The noble Lord said that we had assented to compounding. We have assented to nothing of the sort. What we have assented to is a system under which the occupier is first applied to, and then, if he fails to pay, the owner is applied to. The distinction is that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0297"/>
<col>581</col>
under compounding the owner is directly applied to, but under the other system he is only ultimately responsible for the rates.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02422"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>, who had given notice to move the omission of the new Clause D proposed by the Commons, said: This proposed new clause provides that every payment of an assessment by an owner under or in pursuance of the provisions of the immediately preceding section shall, notwithstanding any deduction which the assessing authority is required to allow therefrom, be deemed a payment of the full assessment by the occupier for the purpose of any qualification or franchise which depends on such payment. My reason for objecting to that is the reason I gave to your Lordships a short time ago&#x2014;that this subsection as it stands would empower the parish council to collect the rate from the owner compulsorily. That is why I propose to omit this provision. The new Clause D next provides that where an owner who is
<col>582</col>
responsible therefor omits or neglects to pay any such assessment, the occupier may pay the same and deduct the amount from the rent due or accruing due to the owner. The reason why I object to that is that under those words an interpretation would be imparted to Section 345 which I believe is contrary to the real meaning of the Act. I know that noble Lords hold that under Section 345 you can apply direct to the owner. All I can say is it never has been done, and it certainly is not the law at the present time. The only case which has been taken into Court went in the other direction. These words appear to me most objectionable, because they would construe the section the other way. The remaining proviso in the new Clause D is the one which I have inserted in my Amendment.</p>

The object of the Bill is to enable this country to become a party to an International Convention which has recently been concluded between various European Powers in order to facilitate the movement of motor cars from one country to another. By the Convention provision is made for the issue of travelling passes to motorists passing from their own to another country. These will admit the car and

driver without investigation or examination of the capacity of either. A car entering a foreign country will be allowed to carry the identification plates of the country of origin surmounted by an oval plate to indicate the country whose plates it bears. Your Lordships will see that by this reciprocal registration will be promoted. The operative part of the Bill&#x2014;that is, subsections (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of Clause 1&#x2014;is concerned with meeting these two points. It is proposed that an Order in Council should be issued to deal with the detail of the subject, and the Bill will give authority for this being done. The Bill passed through the other House without opposition and it is hoped it will become law forthwith, so that the Convention may be ratified as soon as possible.</membercontribution></p>

<col>584</col>
trust your Lordships will give the same support as you extended to the other Bill. The object of this measure is to remove a difficulty which county councils have experienced in raising loans under the Local Government Act, 1888. Section 69 of that Act enables a county council to borrow by means (1) of stock issued under the Act; (2) of debentures or annuity certificates under the Local Loans Act, 1875; and (3) if special reasons are shown, of mortgage in accordance with the Public Health Act, 1875. Subsection (9) provides that where a county council have borrowed by means of stock they shall not borrow by way of mortgage except for a period not exceeding five years. The result of the subsection is that where county councils have stock and borrow by way of mortgage, they must issue fresh stock at the end of the period of five years for which the mortgage is granted, although the loan may have many years to run. This is sometimes very inconvenient. This inconvenience has been pressed on the Board, particularly in connection with loans under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, on behalf of several county councils, and especially of Somerset. It has been urged that these loans might be excluded from the operation of the subsection. No advantage has been derived from the restriction, and the Bill proposes to repeal it altogether. The Bill passed the other House unopposed, and it is hoped it will become law this session.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TELEPHONES IN IRELAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02438"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government what main telephone lines now exist in Ireland, and whether any steps are being taken to extend them over the country, I regret that the noble Earl who represents the Post Office in this House is
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0299"/>
<col>585</col>
not in his place. I know he takes a great interest in this subject, and I am sure he would have endeavoured from his knowledge of Ireland to give as sympathetic an answer as possible, whereas the noble Lord who will reply can only give me the official answer with which he has been supplied. As far as I can make out, the principle on which telephonic communication has been developed in Ireland has been a very proper one. First of all, the large towns have been linked up. Dublin is connected with Belfast, Cork, and Limerick, and even with Galway, but so far as I can make out. Galway is the only town in the West which is in direct telephonic communication with London. I am aware that the Post Office must consider whether any extension of their lines is likely to be a commercial success, but I cannot help thinking that cause and effect are factors it is rather difficult to calculate. The time will be remembered when the production of the yellow envelope containing a telegram filled many old people with alarm. Now everybody regards a telegram with absolute composure, and I cannot help thinking that something of the same kind might be the case with regard to telephones, and that if they were available people would soon learn how useful they were and would be prompt to take advantage of them. As I have said, Galway is in direct communication with London, but I cannot understand why it is that no towns on the line between Dublin and Galway are in communication. For instance, the line must pass through Athlone and Athenry, but it is impossible to communicate with either of those places. I venture to suggest whether it would not be possible to open a telephone office at Athlone in the first place and see if it paid, and then gradually extend the system to Athenry and other places. I do not for a moment suggest that it is possible for the Post Office to extend a network of telephones over the whole of Ireland; but I am anxious to know whether the matter is being dealt with in a haphazard manner, or whether a system exists for the gradual development of telephone communication all over Ireland. I am sure the latter is the proper way to set to work. This communication would be most useful in time of peace, and it seems to me that it would be almost essential should we be unfortunately engaged in war.</membercontribution></p>

From Maryborough a line runs north to Tullamore and Clara, and south to Kilkenny. A long cross-country line runs from Ennis and Limerick to Tipperary, Clonmel, Waterford, and Wexford; and another from Tralee and Killarney to Mallow and Fermoy. The principal extensions in prospect are (1) from Enniskillen to Sligo; (2) to Mullingar, Athlone, and ultimately to Galway; (3) to Clones and Cavan.

<title>BACK-TO-BACK HOUSES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02442"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether Dr. Darra Mair was instructed to report on the sanitary conditions of back-to-back houses in Halifax in 1908; whether he carried out his inspection in May, 1908; and whether His Majesty's Government will lay his Report upon the Table of the House. I think your Lordships will appreciate why I ask this Question at this moment. The Housing and Town Planning Bill will shortly come before us with an Amendment inserted by your Lordships on the subject of back-to-back houses disagreed with by the other House. When that Bill was taken in Committee in your Lordships' House there
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0300"/>
<col>587</col>
were no statistics available to show what was the sanitary condition of modern back-to-back houses; and Mr. Burns, when he moved the Second Reading in another place, gave no information whatever of an official character on that subject. He quoted from a book published in 1840 about back-to-back houses, from a leaflet issued by a society in London for the prevention of consumption, and from an undated Report. And when the Bill went back to the Commons be quoted some figures which were given by medical officers of health in Lancashire, I think notably with regard to Liverpool; but what he did not quote, and what has never been given to us, is the Report of Dr. Darra Mair, who was appointed to inquire specially into this matter. This gentleman was asked, as I am informed, to make his inspection in 1908, and he made it in May of that year; yet we have no information of what he said except from a report published in the <i>Yorkshire Observer</i>, according to which the Medical Officer of Health for Halifax stated that Dr. Darra Mair had selected certain back-to-back houses at Halifax as typical. He gave a table which showed that the death-rate for back-to-back houses was 13&#x00B7;3 and for through houses 15&#x00B7;6. From phthisis the death-rate for back-to-back houses was one, and for through houses 1&#x00B7;6. Therefore, the only official figures available are favourable to the back-to-back houses, which are being condemned by the Government. That being so, I ask His Majesty's Government to lay Dr. Darra Mair's Report on the Table. It might have been laid some time ago, but I can quite understand why it has been suppressed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02443"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: In reply to the noble Lord, I can only say that Dr. Darra Mair was instructed by the Local Government Board to make the investigation in question, but it was part of a very wide investigation, in the course of which he visited a considerable number of towns besides Halifax. It is quite true, as the noble Lord has said, that he began his investigations in 1908.

<title>BRITISH INDIANS IN THE TRANSVAAL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02464"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies what had been the result of his negotiations in regard to the question of British Indians in the Transvaal and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope that the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies will recognise that in this matter I have not been importunate, that I have even been patient, that I have refrained from asking him Questions on the subject from time to time when he represented to me that the moment was not opportune and that if I delayed he might be able to give me a more satisfactory answer. But I think the time has come when the matter will not brook
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0302"/>
<col>591</col>
any further delay, and when it is desirable that Parliament and the public should be informed of the present state of the case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02465">I will not take up time by repeating the past history of the question. I will begin with a period of four months ago, when the occasion of the discussion of the South African Constitution Bill raised hopes that this question&#x2014;this unhappy question&#x2014;which has reflected no credit on the Colony and no credit on the Imperial Government, which has been fraught with such misery to the British Indians in the Transvaal, would at last be settled; that there would be some generous concession on the part of the Colony, inspired, perhaps, by the Imperial Government, which would enable the British Indians to participate in the general rejoicing over the Union of South Africa. With these hopes in mind two Indian gentlemen, Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Hajee Habib, arrived as delegates from the British Indian community in the Transvaal on the 10th of July. They stated their case to the responsible authorities in this country, they refrained from any sort or kind of public agitation, and they waited patiently in the hope that their expectation would be fulfilled. I asked the noble Earl from time to time whether he was able to make any statement in this House as to the progress of his negotiations, and he led me to hope that by waiting a little longer it might be possible to hear a satisfactory announcement; and in the breasts of the delegates great hopes were engendered by the sympathetic manner in which the noble Earl received them and listened to their representations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02466">The Transvaal Ministers left the country and still nothing was settled, and the delegates waited on. Then the replies which they received from the Colonial Office became somewhat discouraging, and finally, about a week ago, they received an answer from the Colonial Office which crushed their hope of a settlement which they could regard as honourable and satisfactory. The delegates, who had all this while maintained an admirable patience and self-restraint, made a dignified and temperate statement to the Press and left the country. Mr. Gandhi, the principal of them, is going back to the Transvaal probably to be clapped once more into gaol and treated as a common criminal. That, my Lords, is the recent history of
<col>592</col>
the question, and I think the time has come when we have a right to know what has actually passed between the Imperial Government and the Colonial Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02467">Now, my Lords, what is the question at issue? I beg your Lordships to give me your attention, for that which I have to say is really a matter of very grave importance. During the past three years Indians in the Transvaal have been deprived of a right which Indians have hitherto enjoyed in every other part of the Empire&#x2014;the right of entry into the Colony. That right, although it exists in theory in every other part of the Empire, is in some parts limited in practice. The Indians in the Transvaal are perfectly willing that the right should be limited in the Transvaal to any extent that the Colonial Government may think expedient, but they claim that they should not be deprived of it, and deprived of it in the particular manner which the Colonial Government have chosen. The manner which the Colonial Government have chosen for depriving them of this right&#x2014;a right which I must again remind your Lordships exists in every other part of the Empire and always has existed&#x2014;is that of classing them as prohibited immigrants; that is to say, classing them with the outcast and the scum of humanity I from every other nation. What it amounts to is this. During the past three years, and while the Imperial Government has been under the direction of the Liberal Party, a colour bar has been instituted in South Africa&#x2014;a colour bar such as never before existed in the history of the British Empire. While the Bill for the Union of South Africa was under discussion in both Houses of Parliament the leaders of all Parties protested in the most solemn and emphatic manner against a provision instituting a colour bar. That provision was a disqualification from future political rights. But the colour bar which has been instituted in the Transvaal is far more serious, for it amounts to a deprivation of rights which have always existed&#x2014;not a deprivation of political rights but a deprivation of social rights, of the ordinary rights of the subjects of His Majesty. It is a law declaring all Indians&#x2014;never mind what their status or their education&#x2014;unfit even to enter the Colony, because it classes them with prohibited I immigrants and places them in an inferior position to the people of any other non-Asiatic nation.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0303"/>
<col>593</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02468">We are told that a compromise has been offered. The Indians are offered as a compromise residential permits for a few Indians annually, and they are considered unreasonable because they will not barter the honour of their race for this slight concession to the material comfort of their community. I cannot for the life of me understand the position of those who say that the Indians ought to accept this compromise, as people call it. My Lords, will you not allow Indians to have a sense of honour? Will you not admit that they can feel, that they have a right to feel, in these matters just as we should feel ourselves? Have they not proved it? Those of your Lordships who have followed the story of passive resistance in the Transvaal cannot possibly have any doubt on that subject. The Indians domiciled in the Transvaal&#x2014;that is to say, who have a right to be there according to the present laws of the Colony&#x2014;number some 13,000. At the present moment I am informed that there are only 5,000 in the Colony. That means that 8,000 Indians who have been unable to stand this persecution have been driven away from the country in which they have a right to live. Over 2,500 Indians have passed through the gaols of the Transvaal, and of that number all but 150 have been imprisoned with hard labour. Many hundreds of families have been utterly ruined, and the whole tale of self-sacrifice and suffering is one of the most remarkable and extraordinary you can find. About sixty Indians have been deported to India and landed there penniless and friendless, for India is not their home&#x2014;they belong to the Transvaal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02469">A few days ago the Prime Minister, speaking at the Guildhall, used memorable words of which I beg leave to remind your Lordships, for they bear very closely on that which I have been saying. The Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"If we do not forget, as we cannot and as we ought not to do, that besides Briton and Boer South Africa contains a vast population of the coloured subjects of the King, we may, I believe, feel the strongest confidence that the same width of outlook, the same liberality of temper which has made possible the Union, will be exercised as widely and as promptly as policy and prudence may allow in extending to its broadest possible limits both the rights and privileges of citizenship."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02470">Well, my Lords, if that is not merely an empty phrase, it means that His Majesty's Government have at heart the cause of the
<col>594</col>
British Indians, and that they have felt bound to do something to promote it. What have His Majesty's Government done or been doing to repair the grave mistakes of the past&#x2014;the mistakes which gave sanction to this unfortunate legislation? There have been communications; there have been communications with the delegates in this country and there must have been communications with the Government of the Colony. I hope that the noble Earl will see his way to lay those Papers on the Table of the House. I am aware&#x2014;painfully aware&#x2014;that this cause has suffered from the advocacy of a person so insignificant and uninfluential as myself, but there was nobody else to take it up. The cause, however, is worthy of the advocacy of the foremost in the land. It is a cause which has been advocated by the foremost in the land, by the leaders of both Parties, and I fail to understand why they are not still advocating it. Will none of your Lordships take up the question&#x2014;take it out of my feeble hands&#x2014;and press it as you would press any question which concerns the plighted words of our Statesmen, the honour of our race, and the contentment of the people of India. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02471"><i>Moved</i>, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the negotiations in regard to the question of British Indians in the Transvaal.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ampthill.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02472"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PEIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOB THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel sure that the House will agree that in what the noble Lord said about his presentation of the subject he has been unduly modest. The case as he has more than once brought it before the House could not, I think, have been argued with greater ability, if he will allow me to say so, or with more reason or moderation, and although the points involved are somewhat difficult and technical, I think the noble Lord has on previous occasions succeeded in making them clear to the House at large.<lb/>
Like the noble Lord, I will not attempt to travel over the earlier history of this difficult subject. It is quite true, as he said, that the visit of so many South African Statesmen here in connection with the Union Bill afforded, in our opinion,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0304"/>
<col>595</col>
a favourable occasion for an attempt to arrive at some solution of the difficulty which would be satisfactory to the Indian population of the Transvaal, acceptable to the Colonial Government, and reasonable in the view of public opinion here. If, as I fear, we have not been altogether successful in arriving at such a solution, I can assure the noble Lord and the House that it has not been for want of efforts on my part&#x2014;on the part of His Majesty's Government; and I do not think any failure there has been is in any way due to the manner in which the spokesmen for the Indians have put their case, because they put it with skill and with fairness; neither has it been due to a want of a true and deep-seated desire on the part of the Transvaal Ministers to settle the question if they could.<lb/>
The two points to which our attention was originally directed as constituting the principal grievance, partly theoretical and partly practical, of the Indians in the Transvaal were these. The first was a desire that Act No. 2 of 1907&#x2014;what is known as the Voluntary Registration Act&#x2014;should be repealed. It was considered that the continued existence of that Act on the Statute Book of the Transvaal constituted a slight to the Indian population, and its repeal was demanded. In the second place, we were told that if the Indian community in the Transvaal was to continue and prosper it was necessary that from time to time certain professional persons, either priests or doctors or the like, should be able to have free access to the country, because it was evident that if by lapse of time those who belonged to those professions in the country died or left the Transvaal, the community might be left without those adjuncts to its general civilisation, which would make it impossible for it to continue. In the conversations which I had with the Transvaal Ministers those two points were principally borne in mind, and the outcome of our conversations was that they expressed themselves willing, if an opportunity offered, to repeal Act No. 2 of 1907, which had really fallen into disuetude because its place had been taken by an Act of last year, called the Asiatics Registration (Amendment) Act. I pointed out, on the second matter, that it would not be fair to admit these professional persons from India merely under a temporary permit but that if admitted in limited number&#x2014;
<col>596</col>
and it was considered that the number of six in each year would meet the case&#x2014;they ought to be admitted as residents in the country with the power of settling there permanently. On that point, too, the Transvaal Ministers expressed them selves willing to attempt to meet the wishes of the Indians. Therefore, so far as the practical difficulty was concerned and the practical disabilities under which the Indian population laboured, it seemed as if there was a good prospect of those being removed.<lb/>
But there remained the theoretical grievance, of which the noble Lord has spoken. That grievance consists in the I fact that in the Transvaal, unlike other parts of the Empire, Asiatics are explicitly excluded from the Colony instead of being subjected to the treatment they receive in some other Colonies&#x2014;that is to say, of being admissible in theory, but being kept out in fact by being subjected to impossible tests. What happens is that in some other parts of the Empire the admission is, to use the words of the noble Lord, limited in practice. It is not only limited in practice; it is made altogether impossible. An education test is supplied for admission, and a task is set to an Asiatic, although not to an European, which is obviously an impossible one for him to carry out. He is asked, for instance, to translate some scientific work full of technical terms into modern Greek or Roumanian. It is impossible for him to fulfil that obligation, and therefore he is not admitted.<lb/>
And so the question, it seems to me, really comes to this. Is it a greater slight to a race to be told frankly that the members of that race will not be admitted except under certain provisions and limitations, or that they should be told that they are on a theoretical equality with European subjects of His Majesty, but that so far as individuals are concerned they will invariably be kept out? That is a difficult question. I think it might fairly be argued that you do not really save the dignity of a race by, if I may use the phrase, making a fool of the individual in the manner which I have described. On the other hand, it cannot be disputed that the Indians, as represented by their spokesman, Mr. Gandhi, and Mr. Hajee Habib, who accompanied him, one representing the Hindu and the other the Mahomedan population in South Africa, undoubtedly
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0305"/>
<col>597</col>
take the view that if theoretical equality be admitted any administrative steps may be taken, even those of the most fanciful kind I have alluded to, for the exclusion of Asiatics; consequently the proposition to which they were prepared to accede, although I think with some unwillingness, was this&#x2014;that an education test should be devised for all immigrants into the Transvaal, both whites and Asiatics, but that power should be given to the Executive to refuse to admit even those who passed that test. That, it was considered, would safeguard the theoretical position of the Indian. The Transvaal Ministers took exception to that proposition. They took exception to it, first, on the ground that it was a mere device, that it did not represent any practical state of things; and, in the second place, on the ground that once theoretical equality was granted they would be subjected to a continual pressure to increase the amount of practical equality, and that there would be a continual demand for the admission of a greater number. They wished to be safeguarded by statutory obligation or by statutory power to admit a certain fixed number, but they thought that if this complete equality in theory was given the number to be admitted would be subjected to a continual possible increase.<lb/>
I think we should all of us be glad if it were possible that all the subjects of His Majesty all over the world bad equal access to the whole of His Majesty's Dominions; but I am sure that anybody who has even a slight acquaintance with the opinions of those who inhabit our various great over-seas Dominions know that this is an ideal which if it ever is to be attained will only be attained at a very distant date. I do not see myself any signs of a softening of opinion in that direction. I do not know that I should be overstating the case if I said I saw some signs of hardening in the opposite direction. We may all regret that, but we all know that we cannot force on the self-governing Dominions a policy of this kind to which they are so strongly opposed. We know, too, that with them it is not merely a question of prejudice. The matter has its very practical side from the point of view of labour questions, sanitary questions, and other important departments of social life. As I say, I did my best to assist&#x2014;I could do no more than assist&#x2014;at arriving
<col>598</col>
at some solution. The Transvaal Government expressed themselves in general terms willing to bring forward some such legislation as I have mentioned if opportunity offered&#x2014;that is to say, if their Parliament ever met again for business before the formation of the Union. I am not certain that their Parliament will meet for business, and, therefore, their intention must be taken as being subject to that possibility.<lb/>
There is also this side to the matter. When the Union Parliament is formed questions affecting Asiatics come under the Union, and there may be something to be said, both from the point of view of white South Africa and of the Indians, for postponing any further legislative action until the Union Parliament has been formed. We hope that the Union Parliament will be disposed to take a broad view of this question, subject to the strongly held opinions which I have mentioned. What may be the precise views of the representatives of India on this point I am not aware&#x2014;whether they would prefer that those practical steps which the Transvaal Government were disposed to view favourably should be taken before Union, or whether they would prefer to wait until the Union Parliament had come into being. The fact that the grievance which would remain even after such legislation is a theoretical grievance is one which in a sense adds to the gravity of the situation. I am very far indeed from saying that this question of theoretical equality ought to be ignored; and I am disposed to think that within the limits which are possible it is one which those who are responsible for the different Dominion Governments ought to bear in mind. I think I have nothing further to add in the way of giving direct information to the noble Lord. But he has asked for Papers. He will see, of course, that I cannot engage to publish any more Papers on the subject without the concurrence of the South African Government, but I have no reason to suppose that they would object to such written communications as have passed between us being made public, and I will inquire with a view to seeing if it is not possible to publish at any rate some part of the correspondence at an early date.</membercontribution></p>

I do not think there can be any doubt as to which you would prefer. The theoretical grievance could be removed by a stroke of the pen without the Colonial Government giving away an ounce of anything material that they value. I cannot resist the conclusion that it is only false pride and fierce prejudice which stand in the way.</membercontribution></p>

<title>POLITICAL PRISONERS AND THEIR<lb/> FASTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02477"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether, if he has not already done so, he will make a representation to the Government of the Transvaal on the hardship inflicted on Mahomedan political prisoners by the prison authorities making no concession during the Fast of Ramadh&#x00E2;n in respect of their meals.<lb/>
This deals with only one small feature of the larger question so ably presented to your Lordships by my noble friend on my right, but it is important as it affects the religious scruples of our Mahomedan fellow-
<col>600</col>
subjects in India. As your Lordships are aware, the Fast of Ramadh&#x00E2;n is a very important and stringent Fast and must be observed. No food or drop of water must pass the lips of a Mahomedan from sunrise to sundown, the only exemptions being cases of sickness or when a man is travelling. What Mahomedan political prisoners complain of is that the prison authorities make no concession to them during the Fast of Ramadh&#x00E2;n in respect of their meals. No food is allowed to be given to them at special times which would enable them the better to stand the rigours of the Fast. They ask, if food cannot be so supplied by the prison authorities, whether their friends can be allowed to bring it in to them. I think it is very hard that there should not be greater humanity displayed towards those who are strictly political prisoners. The noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in answering my noble friend, said, as I am sure is the case, that his sympathies are with our Indian fellow-subjects generally, and he added that what we should like to see is very difficult of attainment, and that there is rather a hardening than any weakening of the attitude of Colonial authorities against the other subject races of the Empire. But I think there is also, on the other side, a gathering force of opinion, particularly in India, in this matter which ought to be recognised, and recognised particularly by those who, after all, are the trustees of their interests. These people have no Government of their own to which to make representations; they must trust the Imperial authorities. The feeling to which I refer is crystallising, and wherever you look in the East you see indications that races which have hitherto been subject races mean in future to make themselves more felt, and, therefore, I think it is more necessary that in cases like this something should be done to meet grievances. The number of Mahomedans affected is no doubt very small. But it is a matter that affects their religious scruples and consciences, and one which should be given attention to, and I shall be glad if the noble Earl can say he has done or will do something in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02478"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what with Suffragettes in this country who will not eat at all and Mahomedans who will only eat at certain hours, it is pretty clear that the question of feeding prisoners is a rather difficult one. I am
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0307"/>
<col>601</col>
not familiar with the details of this question, and I cannot state offhand what was the practice in Egypt where there were a few political prisoners; but I should like to testify to the extraordinary importance that Mahomedans generally attach to this matter. The Fast of Ramadh&#x00E2;n is, perhaps, one of the most important features of the Mahomedan religion, and I cannot help thinking that the refusal of this concession would not only affect the prisoners themselves, but would be calculated to have a bad influence on the opinions of Mahomedans generally. I therefore hope the noble Earl will be able to communicate with the Transvaal authorities and that they will make this concession. It can only be a question of prison arrangements and of providing food at special hours; and I think it is a concession which, considering the interests involved, might reasonably be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02479"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the matter is one to which I think your Lordships' attention may very reasonably be drawn, and the noble Lord opposite has, if I may say so, stated the case quite fairly. As soon as we heard that this question had been raised we communicated with the Transvaal Government. Indeed I sent two separate communications on the subject. They were under the impression that in India the prison arrangements were not made to facilitate the keeping of the Fast of Ramadh&#x00E2;n. I understand, however, that that is not altogether the case, and that in some parts of India&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02480"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: May I ask whether that is in the case of political prisoners or ordinary prisoners in India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02481"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know how that may be. I do not know that a distinction is drawn in the Transvaal between political prisoners or other prisoners any more than it is in the case of certain prisoners in this country. But, so far as I can gather, in India the practice is not
<col>602</col>
absolutely uniform. I confess that, speaking entirely for myself, I should be very glad if this concession could have been made, because the idea is disagreeable to everybody of adding to the punishment of any person an extra penalty, more particularly if that penalty is connected with the observance of his religion. But the difficulty, I understand, which the Transvaal Government have in agreeing to this is that in the Cape Colony, where, of course, there are many more Mahomedans than in the Transvaal, it has never been the practice to make arrangements for the observance of Ramadh&#x00E2;n in prisons, and they find it difficult to differentiate their practice from that of their neighbours. I understand that, so far as the religious duty is concerned, by the ordnances of Islam those who are in prison or are prevented by any such means from keeping Ramadh&#x00E2;n can keep it another time; but, however that may be, it is certain that the practice is not invariable through-out the Empire for the maintenance of its observance. That is all the information I can give.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02482"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is incorrect in saying that exemptions, other than in the case of sickness or travelling, are allowed. I have that on the authority of one of the heads of the Mahomedan religion. He also implied that no difference was made in this country in the case of prisoners being political or not, but surely political prisoners have been treated differently till they have broken the common law. Therefore the case to which I have called attention is one of extreme hardship, and I trust that some good may result from the raising of the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02483"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the question has ceased to be a practical one for the moment, because the month of Ramadh&#x00E2;n is, I believe, now over.</membercontribution></p>

As your Lordships know, the Bill as it came from another place was very freely amended, and, indeed, almost transfigured in this House, and on its return to another place your Lordships' Amendments were taken <i>en bloc</i> and were not agreed to by the House of Commons. That course is one which has been taken before, and it is one
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0309"/>
<col>605</col>
which, in my opinion, it is and always will be practically necessary to take in the case of a Bill which has been so freely amended as was the case with this measure. In taking that course the Government and my right hon. friend the Chief Secretary did not desire, I need not say, to show any disrespect to your Lordships' House or to the Amendments themselves which were made. But in such a case, if there is to be any hope or chance of a Bill becoming law, it is hardly possible that a measure so altered should run the gauntlet of a long discussion, possibly bitter, in another place on points so novel as many of those which were inserted by your Lordships in the Bill. I think it may almost be taken for granted that if that course were taken in another place the Bill could have practically no chance of surviving. Therefore it was in the interest of this legislation, I venture fearlessly to assert, that my right hon. friend took the course he did. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02504"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships will agree with the noble Earl in his observation that some explanation was due to your Lordships of the manner in which our Amendments were treated elsewhere. Those Amendments, upon which the House had bestowed much thought and attention, were rejected, I will not say unceremoniously but <i>in globo</i> and after a very brief discussion, and I have no doubt that if your Lordships had been minded to stand upon your dignity on this occasion you might have replied that you regarded the discussion as terminated by the treatment of your Amendments in the House of Commons, and that you saw no object in continuing it in this House. But, my Lords, the case is one of such importance that I feel sure your Lordships will not be influenced by any feelings of pique or resentment in your treatment of the Bill at this stage.<lb/>
I confess however that I was rather alarmed when I heard the noble Earl say that in his opinion the course followed by the House of Commons on this occasion was the coarse which would always be appropriate when a Bill had been very freely amended in this House. I take note of that observation only in order that I may express my disagreement
<col>606</col>
with it. But I do feel that in this case there were really considerable material difficulties in readjusting the very elaborate scheme of Amendments which your Lordships had inserted in the Bill, and we noted when the matter was dealt with by the Chief Secretary that throughout his observations there ran a note of compromise which we were quite ready to listen to in a not unfriendly spirit. I think it is a matter of common knowledge that since the Bill came back to this House there have been discussions outside these walls between representatives of the Party opposite and representatives of those who sit on this side, and I do not think I am committing any indiscretion when I say that the Amendments, some of which will be proposed from the opposite side of the House and some from this side of the House, are to a considerable extent the outcome of these informal discussions.<lb/>
My Lords, may I be permitted to say that throughout all these controversies the dominant consideration in our minds has been that we should, if possible, do nothing which would jeopardise the progress of land purchase in Ireland. In our view&#x2014;and I think that view is shared by the noble Earl and his friends&#x2014;it would be little short of a calamity if purchase operations in Ireland abruptly came to an end. There are, I believe, pending agreements representing about fifty millions of money still in suspense, and I believe it was stated by the Chief Secretary that no fewer than 175,000 tenants were in a position of uncertainty as to the completion of the transactions which will eventually, we hope, make them owners of the land which they occupy. We feel that it would be a very serious blow for this House to do anything to dash the hopes which have been raised in the minds of these poor people. Another feeling has been constantly with us&#x2014;namely, that we desire to do nothing which might obstruct the effort which His Majesty's Government wish to make to relieve congestion in Ireland. But we couple with that the reservation that in our view, while the relief of congestion is a very desirable thing, the use of public money for the purpose of providing those persons who are known as "landless men" with land is, on the contrary, an extremely undesirable thing, and we desire to do all in our power to prevent it. We have been mindful of these considerations, and they have weighed
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0310"/>
<col>607</col>
with us when we came to consider such important questions as the treatment of the zones, the position of the Congested Districts Board, and the proposal to resort to compulsion in one form or another.<lb/>
With regard to the zones, the maintenance of the zones has always been in our view an absolutely essential point. The zones are to us, if I may say so, the Arc of the Covenant, and I am glad to know that the noble Earl opposite does not disagree with us in principle on that point. I shall presently move an Amendment which will, I hope, deal with the only class of cases in which the zones can appropriately be set on one side. With regard to the Congested Districts Board, again, our sole desire has been to render that Board as efficient as possible for the purpose which it is intended to fulfil, and our reasons for objecting to the proposed constitution of that Board were due to the fact that we were convinced that the Board as originally contemplated by His Majesty's Government would be an extremely inefficient body for the purpose for which it is designed. In the same way we made proposals for the redistribution of work between the Congested Districts Board, the Land Commission, and the Department of Agriculture, again with the object of providing, as it seemed to us, more efficient machinery for the purpose of carrying out the objects which His Majesty's Government have in view.<lb/>
As to compulsion, we reluctantly admitted the principle of compulsion in the congested districts, but we are now prepared to agree to a proposal that that compulsion should extend not only to the areas scheduled as congested, but also to those scattered patches of congestion which are to be found in other parts of Ireland outside the limits of the congested areas. We cannot see that we can justify the proposal to deal with congestion in one part of Ireland without permitting similar remedies to be applied to it in other parts of Ireland where it may also exist. We have coupled that concession with a stipulation to which I, for one, attach very great importance, and to which we understand His Majesty's Government are prepared to assent. I mean the stipulation that what I may call the standard of congestion is to be restored to the figure of &#x00A3;5 instead of &#x00A3;10 at which it stood in the Bill when it left the House of Commons.<lb/>
<col>608</col>
I dwell upon one other point, which also seems to me of great importance. We have stipulated that wherever compulsion is exercised the price to be paid to the person who is compulsorily required to give up his land should be based upon the fair value of that land to him. We have also stipulated that the question of deciding whether compulsion is necessary and the price upon which the person compelled is to be deprived of his land should be dealt with by an independent tribunal unconnected with, or at any rate independent of, the Land Commission. To our mind that condition was, perhaps, the most vital and important of all, because we felt that if we were sure of our tribunal, and if there could be no doubt that that tribunal was thoroughly competent and independent, we need not insist too particularly upon precautions and safeguards at other points. I have ventured to give your Lordships this brief indication of the policy which was present to the minds at any rate of those persons who were engaged in these informal discussions, and I hope that we shall now proceed to discuss the Amendments <i>seriatim</i>. I will only add this one word: that so far as we on this Bench are committed to some of these proposals, which we regard as very important concessions to the views of His Majesty's Government, it must be clearly understood that our adhesion is conditional upon the adhesion of His Majesty's Government to other proposals which perhaps are not particularly acceptable to them, but to which they have agreed for the purpose of promoting a settlement.</membercontribution></p>

that is proved by the fact that without it those informal communications of which he spoke could not and would not have taken place. The Amendments as they stand on the Paper are to a large extent to be moved by myself, and there are a few down in the names of other noble Lords. I am obliged to make a similar caution to that which the noble Marquess made just now. I do not pretend that some of the Amendments which I am moving embody the views of His Majesty's Government. They represent in some cases to our mind a second best or third best course, but so far as we are concerned the Amendments which are down on the Paper in my name represent what we are prepared to undertake to support in another place. As regards the Amendments which have been placed on the Paper by the noble Lord opposite, I will defer until we come to them such reasons as I may have for stating that they do not embody the considered views of His Majesty's Government, and it will, of course, be for your Lordships then to consider them one by one. But so far as the Amendments in my name are concerned, involving, as they do, concessions in some cases on a very large scale to the views of noble Lords opposite, they may be taken as embodying what we are prepared to do with regard to this measure.</membercontribution></p>

This clause deals with the regulations respecting priority, and is to some extent a reproduction of the original Government Amendment. It is modified in one or two respects. It is not necessary to embody any reference to Section 23 of the Act of 1903 because that section only relates to transactions carried out by the Estates Commissioners, whereas the regulations would naturally refer also to sales of holdings and transactions carried out by the Congested Districts Board. Then we have not kept the words relating to priority of time, but we have remodelled the idea comprised in those words by our subsection (2), and in subsection (3) we simply provide for the laying of the regulations before Parliament.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02522"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment of which I have given notice is an attempt to meet the only point which I think was made successfully by noble Lords opposite against what we commonly refer to as the zone system. We all desire that the zones should be as far as possible maintained, but it was suggested by the noble Earl opposite that there were cases in which the zones should be departed from and in which the Commissioners should be given power of declaring that the zones should not apply owing to undue pressure being brought upon the tenant, who thereby ceased to be a free agent and became a party to a bargain which was either an inequitable bargain so far as he was concerned or involved undue risk to the State. We challenged noble Lords opposite to supply us with cases where these occurrences had taken place, and I believe one or two cases were mentioned in which a suspicion, or more than a suspicion, of this unfair influence had arisen. I am advised that so far as fraud and collusion in the ordinary sense are concerned the existing law is a sufficient safeguard; but we did think it possible that where an improper transaction was brought about owing to the existence of large arrears there might be some case for giving the Court a power of intervention. I say large arrears, because in our view there is nothing whatever improper, where a tenant owes, as a great many tenants in Ireland do, a certain number of years arrears, in an arrangement between vendor and purchaser under which those arrears or a part of them are in effect added to the purchase money. That is a view held by learned Judges in Ireland who have pronounced on the subject. In one case Lord Chancellor Walker used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"When a tenant owes an arrear in respect of his holding and asks his landlord to sell, he cannot expect that he can get it for the same price as if he owed none, especially in view of the fact that the agreement discharges the arrear due."</quote>
In the same case Lord Justice FitzGibbon said&#x2014;
<quote>"Is there anything wrong or unjust in saying that tenants who owe arrears, and have, therefore, less interest in their holdings, shall pay a higher price for purchasing their farms? "</quote>
<col>612</col>
That seems to me an eminently reasonable doctrine, provided always the transaction falls within the limits of the zones and the bargain is a perfectly safe one for the State. We have drafted words which would meet the cases&#x2014;the rare and unusual cases&#x2014;where, owing to pressure of this kind, a bargain was struck which might be unfair to the State and occasion a risk to the Treasury; and we fully admit that, considering the large amounts of public money which we have made use of for this purpose, the interests of the Treasury as a party to the transaction require to be very carefully considered. The effect of the words which I have put on the Paper will be this. In the first place, there must be arrears; in the second place, those arrears must have been used for the purpose of coercing the tenant; and, in the third place, the result must be to involve the Treasury in a risk which it would not otherwise incur. The tenant is embarrassed, advantage is taken of his embarrassment, and the result is that an inequitable transaction is come to. We propose that in such cases the Court may by order declare that the provisions of the subsection as to zones shall not apply, and we add to that a safeguard which seems to us a very important one&#x2014;namely, that wherever this happens a person aggrieved by any order of the Land Commission may, within the prescribed time and within the prescribed manner, apply to the Land Commission to refer the order to the Judicial Commissioner for consideration, so that in cases of doubt the high authority of the Judicial Commissioner will be invoked. Those words seem to us to safeguard as effectually as possible the kind of cases which we gather His Majesty's Government have in view, and as it is our desire that this clause should be perfectly watertight and that there should be no suspicion of any desire to encourage I transactions inequitable from the point of view of the State, we move that the words be added to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

Whether the words which the noble Marquess proposes will really in practice do what is required I think is open to some question. The noble Marquess said it was generally agreed that cases of fraud could be met and dealt with in the way that cases of fraud in all matters may be&#x2014;by recourse to a Court of law; bat the real question I think in this instance is the power which the Estates Commissioners will have of discovering that anything improper has taken place. The words as originally proposed gave a power of inquiry into the circumstances, which noble Lords opposite thought too dangerously wide; but whether the words which are included in the noble Marquess' Amendment really give the Estates Commissioners the power which will enable them to discover such a thing, although the words would enable them to deal with it, is, I am afraid, open to some question. However, I will say no more on that point. I would suggest to the noble Marquess that the words "the risk to the Treasury would, if the advance were made, be thereby unduly increased" might be improved. It is not usual to speak of the Treasury as such in matters of that kind, and I would venture to suggest that there might be substituted the words "that the security for the advance might in consequence be insufficient."

I well know the kindly feelings which animate the noble Marquess towards the congested peasantry of Ireland, but I consider that no change in this Bill would have a more depreciatory effect upon the relief of congestion than that which has been recommended to your Lordships by the noble and learned Lord. In the congested areas of Ireland at present the average valuation is over &#x00A3;5&#x2014;the average valuation at present is &#x00A3;6 3<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.; and this alteration would have the effect of still further lowering the position of the Irish congested tenantry. I am glad to say that under the administration of the Congested Districts Board hitherto, although the limit of &#x00A3;5 stood in the law, it was always ignored. Efforts were made to aim at a higher standard even than &#x00A3;10, and my hope and prayer is that in the years to come, as in the years that have passed, the Congested.

It has to be remembered that this Amendment is of a very far-reaching character. Its effects are not confined simply to the words of this clause, but they run through the whole of the Bill so far as it attempts to deal with congestion; and from that point of view I greatly regret the weakening and the emasculating of the Bill, because I can call it by no other name, by this very far-reaching Amendment. Even if noble Lords opposite had argued that to jump from the &#x00A3;5 limit to a &#x00A3;10 limit was too bold a step, although I do not believe that in effect it would have been found a dangerous one, they might, at any rate, I think, have suggested some intermediate figure&#x2014;something which would have shown a desire for some advance towards a higher standard, which I am sure in the abstract noble Lords opposite would be glad to see brought into operation no less than ourselves. I really cannot say whether the Bill will become law with this figure in it, but, if it should, I am certain that the matter will not be allowed to rest here, and that demands will be made&#x2014;and from my point of view I should hope pressed&#x2014;for an early enlargement of this really inadequate figure.

The Bill places practically the whole of the business relating to congested districts in the hands of a Board, practically without the control of Parliament, and to consist of members nominated by the Chief Secretary. The powers which will be conferred upon the Board by the Bill are, I think, unprecedented in the case of a Board which has not at its head a representative in Parliament.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0316"/>
<col>619</col>
The operations of the Board already are on a gigantic scale, and the additions which will be made by the Bill to the congested areas will increase the work of the Board enormously. The proposal in the clause to change the limit of value from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;10 would involve millions of money&#x2014;at least &#x00A3;250,000 a year. My noble friends on this side of the House are as desirous as are the Government of dealing with the matter; but I think that the steps which Parliament has taken this year go as far as we can go with prudence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02557"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for not being in my place when this Amendment was called. The noble Earl describes it as a very far-reaching one. So in a sense it is. But I would rather like to put it to him that the proposal to change the &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;10 is what is really the far-reaching proposal. The effect of that would, we are advised, have been to include an enormous additional area&#x2014;I am told more than to double the area known as congested. I agree with my noble friend Lord Midleton in thinking that noble Lords opposite do not perhaps bear in mind sufficiently the immense powers which we have given to the Congested Districts Board. It is quite true that congestion does not prevail in the whole of the scheduled area; but, as I read the Bill as it will stand after our Amendment, the Congested Districts Board will be allowed to operate not only in those smaller areas which are described as congested counties, but outside the limits of those and in the administrative counties which include the congested counties. In that larger area they will have the right of compulsorily acquiring untenanted land, the right of compulsorily acquiring congested estates, and the right of carrying out the various ameliorative schemes which they will no doubt undertake with the very large funds placed at their disposal. I really believe that even with the lower limit, to which my noble friends attach great importance, the scope of the new Board will be so extensive that even its most enthusiastic friends and admirers will have no reason whatever for complaint that its activities have been at all circumscribed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02558"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: It has always appeared to me that a test of &#x00A3;10 was a most illogical test, considering that by your own Bill you make a holding of &#x00A3;10
<col>620</col>
valuation an economic holding. Therefore notwithstanding the test you yourselves have adopted, an estate on which there were a certain number of &#x00A3;10 holdings became a congested estate. If a &#x00A3;10 holding is an economic holding, what was the sense of enacting that an estate which had a certain number of economic holdings upon it became a congested estate? So far from this Amendment being conceived in any hostile spirit to the proposal to deal with congestion, it is really an aid to the dealing with congestion, because if you accept the &#x00A3;10 limit, the claims on the Congested Districts Board would be so enormously increased that by no human possibility could they apply themselves to the more pressing claims of congestion. This will enable them to deal effectively with the real crying cases, and leave the men with economic holdings to wait until some other time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02580"><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: This clause provides that the Estates Commissioners may make proposals and enter into negotiations for the purchase, under Section 6 of the Act of 1903, of any estate not situated in a congested districts county. This was struck out in Committee, and it is with great regret that we see it reintroduced. As it stands, the provision is of a most sweeping and arbitrary character. It enables the Estates Commissioners to propose to an owner, first of all to sell his property to them under Section 6, and then, without his consent, to send inspectors to fix a price, thereby entirely precluding the owner from selling direct to his tenants. I need not remind your Lordships that the zones do not exist in transactions under Section 6. The proceeding would result in a price being put on the property, and once having been fixed by a Government authority it would be the utmost the owner could expect to receive. Therefore it brings in, in a sense,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0318"/>
<col>623</col>
compulsion. Further, it would establish a new standard in the neighbourhood, and tenants who had already purchased and whose agreements were pending would be very naturally discontented if the price fixed in this way were a lower one, and would be disposed to go back on their former agreements. But, apart from that, it certainly seems a most arbitrary proceeding that a landowner should be given no option in the matter, but should be told he must sell direct to the Estates Commissioners under Section 6.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02581"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may be permitted to explain. Under Section 6 of the Act of 1903 the Commissioners could not approach an owner with a view of entering into negotiations with him. The first part of this clause was intended to relieve the Commissioners from that disability, and to enable them to approach a landlord. The provision to which my noble friend objects is that apparently, whether the landlord consents to enter into negotiations or not, the Estates Commissioners are entitled to send down surveyors and others to ascertain the boundaries of his land, and, I presume, to obtain the information necessary to enable them to make an offer. That does, I admit, appear an arbitrary proceeding, but I do not believe evil consequences would necessarily follow. But perhaps the purpose would be met by prefacing the clause with the words, "If the landlord consents to negotiate." Then the things set forth could be done; but the Commissioners should not be permitted, if the landlord refuses to negotiate, to send officers to inspect the land.</membercontribution></p>

As the clause stands, I can be approached other than by direct negotiation and can have my land inspected. Surely His Majesty's Government do not contemplate putting forward a provision of that description. At the present moment there is a large amount of land in Ireland unsold owing simply to a want of money and not to any disinclination on the part of the landlord to sell. It is very unjust that we should be treated in this way without any fair proposition at all. Moreover, the actual fact of these negotiations having been entered into and our land inspected will depreciate the value of the land to a large extent. The price of and is driven down enormously whenever
<col>624</col>
these inspections take place. A clause of this description would be the death knell of all voluntary and direct sales. If we are to have land purchase, the voluntary arrangement which has up to this time met with such great success should be encouraged, and it should not be permissible for owners to be approached in the way suggested in this clause. Indeed, it would paralyse the whole transaction. We have up to this met in a very favourable spirit the proposals of His Majesty's Government, and I hope we shall be enabled, with the assistance of the Government, to amend this clause in the direction to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>

The noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Atkinson, agreed that it is not unreasonable to give the power of initiative to the Estates Commissioners, and I confess that I should be very sorry to see this clause struck out, because I think on consideration noble Lords will see that to do so would seriously interfere with the machinery which we have proposed in the later clauses.</membercontribution></p>

That is how the provision stands, and that is what we feel affects us. With the proviso suggested by Lord Atkinson enabling the Estates Commissioners to proceed after they have received the consent of the owner we should be pretty safe; but the provision as to the sending of notice by post is rather a strong one, because, after all, the owner might be away.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02590"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am quite ready to be convinced that these words are harmless, but I am not quite convinced yet. Will your Lordships be good enough to bear in mind that this clause does not deal with congested estates. Therefore, you have a case where there are no compulsory powers, and where the transaction is purely voluntary. What does the clause say? It says that in such cases the Commissioners may make a proposal to the landlord or may enter into negotiations with him. By proposal I understand is meant a proposal which major may not be accepted by the other party.
<col>626</col>
One of two things will happen, either that the landlord entertains the proposal or that he does not do so. If he does entertain it, obviously there must be the inquiries and so forth contemplated in subsection (2); but if, on the contrary, the owner of the land says from the outset that he does not entertain the proposal and is not prepared to enter into negotiations, then what in the name of all that is wonderful is the use of sending down inspectors who may go all over the place unsettling the tenants and so forth? Surely the logical tiling to do is to make subsection (2) subject to the consent of the landlord. The proposal is then made, negotiations are entered into, and thereupon, on the consent of the landlord, the inspector is sent down and all the investigations contemplated by the subsection would follow. I would suggest that the clause might read thus&#x2014;
<quote>"The Estates Commissioners may make proposals and enter into negotiations for the purchase, under Section 6 of the Act of 1903, of any estate not situated in a congested districts county, notwithstanding that an application has not boon made to them by the owner under that section;"</quote>
and that then it should proceed&#x2014;
<quote>"If the owner consents to enter into negotiations will) the Estates Commissioners they may, for the purpose of enabling the Commissioners In ascertain the boundaries, Fend down inspectors,"</quote>
and so on. I think the clause would then not be open to the objection raised by my noble friend behind me, and would really do all that the framers desire. I would be much obliged if the noble Earl would consider that suggestion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02592"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: No; because Clause 41 deals with estates which are not congested.

Under Section 6 of the Act of 1903 the Estates Commissioners were prevented from approaching a landlord. The landlord, however, could approach them. That was proposed in order to promote direct sales. Now this clause takes that away, and the Estates Commissioners can approach the landlord. But what we wish to provide is that if the owner is unwilling to sell and rejects the proposals of the Commissioners the Commissioners should not have power to send down inspectors and so forth. What is the use of giving them power to overrun an estate which the owner refuses to sell to them and which they cannot compel him to sell, unless, indeed, it be proposed to enforce compulsion by public odium?

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02610">The noble Lord said: In the debates which we have had on this Bill, which I venture to think might, perhaps, be more properly termed a Landlord Eviction-Made-Easy Bill, I ventured with some persistence to press on the noble Earl to give us the ground on which it was proposed to value land from which the owner was to be compulsorily expropriated; and I think the noble Earl certainly made a very important admission as to the views of the Government on that point on the Report Stage, when he told us that he intended that the value should be the fair annual value to the owner. I think those were his words. It is true that he modified that by comparing freehold land in Ireland to that of a newspaper in England, and suggested that four and a-half years purchase was the value of a newspaper. I do not exactly know what the value of a newspaper is, and I think the noble Earl may have had in his mind the <i>Tribune</i>, which had a meteoric existence as an organ of Radicalism in this country. At any rate, we do not wish to go more minutely into this matter, and we are glad that the noble Earl has added words in this sense in the First Schedule with reference to the question of bonus. But it seems to me that in this clause we are reverting to the old idea which has caused such dread amongst landlords that the price is to be fixed, not at the value to the owner, but at the price which the tenants and other persons are willing to give. It is a matter of indifference to the landowner who is going to be deprived of his land what the tenants are willing to give.
<col>630</col>
The only question that interests him is whether he is going to get the value. I therefore trust that the noble Earl will see that this is a reasonable Amendment, designed to carry out the views which he has himself expressed on the subject. The tenants naturally are willing to give as little as possible, and I cannot see why, in making an offer to the landlord, the Estates Commissioners should consider an absolutely unfair value&#x2014;namely, what the tenants are willing to give.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02612"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I hope the House will not accept the noble Lord's Amendment, because he appears to me on this occasion to have done what I am bound to say he does not often do, and that is to have got hold of the wrong end of the subject. This clause has nothing whatever to do with compulsory purchase. It is an offer made to the landlord for a voluntary sale, and because it is a voluntary sale we adopt the same words which are used in Section 6 of the Act of 1903 in relation to voluntary sales. The noble Lord is mixing up two entirely distinct things. He is mixing up the price the Estates Commissioners think it reasonable to give for the land having regard to what they can sell it for again, and the price which the landlord may ultimately get for it under the award of some tribunal if it is to be compulsorily sold. But it does not at all follow that any transaction will take place in respect of this offer. The Estates Commissioners make an offer, and in making it they bear in mind, and the landlord will bear in mind, that if the transaction takes place it will become a cash transaction if the vendor so desires, and it will therefore be for the landlord to consider whether, in consideration of that fact, he will take rather less money than he might otherwise have taken. The noble Lord must remember that this has nothing to do in any way with compulsory purchase, and there is no reason to suppose that, if it does ultimately come to compulsion, the tribunal or arbitrator who fixes the price will be in any way biased by the offer which the Estates Commissioners have made. The Estates Commissioners may say, "This land has turned
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0322"/>
<col>631</col>
out to be much dearer than we thought and the price is more than we are prepared to give; we would rather not proceed with the transaction at all, and we will go and look somewhere else." The noble Lord has argued as if this offer concluded the transaction. It is merely a stage in the transaction for voluntary purchase. I am afraid we cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02613"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member><membercontribution>: As I read the clause, if any offer is not accepted then the Commissioners can proceed to take the land compulsorily. It does seem an outrageous thing that in ascertaining the price of the land the Commissioners are to consult alone the purchaser as to what he is willing to give, and are not to inquire in the slightest degree the price the vendor is willing to take. Indeed, they are practically excluded from doing so. They must inquire what the purchaser is willing to give, and then they fix a price at which the vendor is compelled to sell.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02614"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the noble Lord above the Gangway has fallen into the same error as the noble Lord who moved the Amendment. The price which the Commissioners offer has no necessary relation to the price which the vendor will ultimately get if it comes to be a matter of compulsion. The two things have no bearing on each other. I will give an instance of the kind of thing that will happen. The Land Commission want a particular piece of land, and offer &#x00A3;1,000. The owner says he will not take less than &#x00A3;1,500. The Land Commission would then have to consider whether, if they have to buy it compulsorily, it will be worth their while to do so in view of the fact that they will have to resell it. It is quite possible that if, on further consideration, they think the land will be pronounced worth much more than the &#x00A3;1,000 which they were prepared to give, they will abandon the transaction altogether, and in that case the whole matter is concluded.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02650"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: I think I have already said in your Lordships' House that I regard this clause as one of the most important in the Bill. This clause and the clause dealing with the <i>personnel</i> of the Congested Districts Board were, in my opinion, from an administrative point of view and from the point of view of the peace and good government of Ireland, the most important in this Bill. Your Lordships have dealt with the question of the <i>personnel</i> of the Board, and on that I desire now to make no comment. But on this clause I would ask your Lordships to consider that in Ireland in dealing with congestion there were two schools of thought&#x2014;mainly the school of those who consider that eleemosynary administration, if I may so call it, should be restricted to the utmost limits, and that the relief of congestion in the West and transfer of property from landlord to tenant should be prosecuted with the utmost despatch. This clause, which transfers to the control of the Congested Districts Board one-third of the entire area of Ireland, a large portion of which is by no means congested under any possible acceptation of the word, raises considerations which are, in my opinion, entirely foreign to the question of the relief of congestion. It raises questions of great political moment into which I do not desire on this occasion to enter; but I consider it my duty to your Lordships to advert to them.<lb/>
I understand from what has fallen from
<col>636</col>
the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition and from the noble Earl the Leader of the House that a general agreement has been come to, and I understand that that general agreement covers this clause although it may not cover it in all its details. Therefore, having regard to what has fallen from the noble Marquess and the noble Earl, I do not desire to move now the omission of the clause, but I desire to move the insertion in subsection (1) of certain words of which I have given notice. The subsection as I propose that it should read will run as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"(1) For the purposes of the Congested Districts Board (Ireland) Acts, as amended by this Act, so much laud as is congested within the meaning of Section 21 of this Act in each of the following administrative counties, that is to say, the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Clare, and Kerry, shall be a congested districts county, and the four rural districts of Bantry, Castletown, Schull, and Skihbereen, in the county of Cork, shall together form one congested districts county."</quote>
The object of that is to exclude from the control, management, and influence of the Congested Districts Board so much of the land as is not congested.<lb/>
At the present time the area subject to the jurisdiction of the Congested Districts Board is as nearly as possible 3,000,000 acres. If Clare had remained in the Bill the additional land which would be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Board would amount to 3,800,000 acres. But, even with the Amendment which I see down in the name of the noble Earl, the new transfer of land to the Congested Districts Board will be considerably over 3,000,000 acres. The land already scheduled as congested gives a valuation of &#x00A3;6 3<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. per holding; the new area gives a valuation of &#x00A3;17 6<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. By no possibility can it be stated that congestion exists in the new area in any sense to the extent that it exists in the old area. The fact is that in this new area which it is proposed to bring under the control of the Board there are scattered congested estates just as there are similar estates scattered throughout the rest of Ireland. Your Lordships, by the modifications which you have made in this Bill and which I have been glad to see, have enabled the Estates Commissioners to deal with congestion outside the congested area, and the Commissioners were perfectly competent to deal with congestion existing in those additional three millions of acres which it is now proposed to transfer
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0325"/>
<col>637</col>
to the Congested Districts Board. I see no reason for this transfer.<lb/>
From the time that congestion was first dealt with the Congested Districts Board never dealt with land which was not considered within the meaning of Section 35 of the Act of 1891. Your Lordships, in Clause 21 of this Bill, have also provided a definition of congestion, and you have limited the activity of the Estates Commissioners in dealing with congestion to estates which met the terms of that definition. But in this proposal, in Clause 48, you throw every definition overboard. You no longer say that the Congested Districts Board shall deal with congestion, but you transfer to the Board the entire area of this large tract of country which, as I say, covered one-third of Ireland before some portion of the county of Clare had been taken away. What is the reason for that? Why should you take away from the Estates Commissioners, who are, in my opinion, a more efficient agent for the purpose of this work than the Congested Districts Board, the opportunity of dealing with this tract of country which is not congested&#x2014;this tract of country in which there are only congested estates sparsely scattered throughout the area; why bring the whole of this vast tract of country under the jurisdiction of a Board over whom Parliament will have very little control? I think that before work is transferred from a Department which is competent to discharge it and added to a body which has already a heavy task to deal with, there should be a far better case made out than has been made out on this occasion. I therefore move the insertion of words the effect of which will be to restrict the Congested Districts Board to dealing with congestion.<lb/>
It may be said, by way of answer, that it is desirable that the Congested Districts Board should have an opportunity of controlling land in the immediate vicinity of congested estates. For instance, it may be said that the Congested Districts Board should have power, of its own motion, to make a road between one congested area and another, and that unless the uncongested areas were made over to the Board some difficulty might be found in carrying through such a project as that. You have given them power under this Bill to take up land compulsorily in any place in an administrative county which
<col>638</col>
contains a congested area, and beyond that they want no further power at all. For these reasons I beg to move the insertion of the words to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>

But against him is a strong body of opinion which believes that this extension of the area and operations of the Board will be for the advantage of the congested districts; that they will become a more important and even more efficient body than they have been in the past; and that, taking it all in all, balancing advantages and disadvantages, it is a real advantage to give them the control in the large area which, by the Bill as we propose to amend it, they are to serve. Mingling together the powers of the Estates Commissioners and of the Congested Districts Board, which would be the effect of adopting my noble friend's Amendment, is regarded by many best qualified to judge as likely to produce serious inconvenience, and I cannot help thinking that the weight of expert opinion is in this particular instance against my noble friend.

We must remember that the whole of the operations of the Congested Districts Board as compared with the Department of Agriculture are absolutely different. The Congested Districts Board has a paternal system of dealing with congestion, whereas the Department relies upon the system of self-help. Now you are going to schedule enormous tracts of country in the West of Ireland which will come under the operations of the paternal system of the Congested Districts Board, which, to my mind, is a great pity.

I am personally reluctant to see this vast area earmarked as congested. We know perfectly well that a great part of it is not congested at all, and that it is entirely misleading so to describe it. But this is a point which we understand is insisted upon as a <i>conditio sine qu&#x00E2; non</i> by His Majesty's Government. The proposal is, of course, an entirely different one from the proposal which found favour with us. We recommended the House to agree to an arrangement which would have made the Land Commission the sole purchasing authority, and which would have shorn the Congested Districts Board of a considerable part of its powers. That proposal His Majesty's Government were unable to accept, and we have agreed to recognise the Congested Districts Board as the purchasing power within the congested districts, and we have also agreed to give back to them a considerable part of the functions of which we proposed to deprive them. Now if that is to be accepted as the point of departure, it seems to me to follow almost of necessity that in those parts of Ireland which contain a congested district but which are not themselves congested you must give the Board certain powers of promoting useful improvements, and certainly of acquiring untenanted land for the relief of congestion within the smaller and congested areas. I am afraid I can see no advantage, when once we have gone so far

as that, in endeavouring to restrict the activities of the Board within those parts of Ireland which contain the congested area properly so called; and therefore, although I am very much in sympathy with the view so well expressed by my noble friend Lord MacDonnell, I am afraid I can scarcely promise him my vote if he goes to a Division.</membercontribution></p>

It is of the utmost importance that touch should be kept between the Congested Districts Board and these bodies, and that local lay opinion should be brought to bear in assistance of the operations of the Congested Districts Board, especially in regard to such matters as parish committees and the expenditure of money by such bodies. I believe that from that the greatest advantage would come, and for that reason I have ventured to place on the Paper the proposal which your Lordships were satisfied with when it was last before you and which you embodied in the Bill as it left this House.</membercontribution></p>

In our original form of the clause which provided for the composition of the Board we suggested an elected element, and we thought that the nine gentlemen who were to be elected as representing the different counties, sitting round a table, would exercise a sound influence, sobered as they would be by the consciousness of responsibility, upon the work of the Board, but we view with a somewhat different eye a proposal to appoint independent
<col>642</col>
committees of this kind responsible to nobody except to themselves. Our opinion, which may or may not be shared by noble Lords, is that the provision of committees of this kind, empowered to make proposals of all sorts to the Congested Districts Board, is not suited to the circumstances that exist in the West of Ireland. We may be wrong and the noble Lord may be right, but I confess I shall be surprised if noble Lords opposite, holding the views they do about the West of Ireland and its inhabitants, should desire to imitate my noble friend by setting up these irresponsible advisory bodies.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02679"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved, on Clause 49 (Transfer of certain powers and duties of the Congested Districts Board to the Department of Agriculture), to add the aiding and developing of industries and fisheries to the powers and duties to be transferred. The noble Lord said: Tins is a proposal, which your Lordships have already accepted, transferring industries and fisheries to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. The Bill as it stands transfers agricultural instruction, forestry, and some small industries; but the great industry of fishing, which is particularly suitable to come under the superintendence of the Department of Agriculture, is to remain with the Congested Districts Board. I have always been in favour of keeping people to their own work and reducing the number of overlapping Departments in Ireland. Here we have an instance of a Department created especially for the purpose of dealing with industries and fisheries. Before the creation of that Department it was quite natural that in the congested districts the Congested Districts Board should be entrusted with these duties, but when a Department has been created, richly endowed, and had passed its novitiate and was an effective Department, surely every canon of good administration pointed to the transfer to that Department of this work. I have had long experience of the Congested Districts Board, and I know that what happens is that a gentleman&#x2014;the most competent, perhaps, in Ireland to deal with fisheries&#x2014;sits as a member of the Congested Districts Board. He deals with fisheries in the building of the Congested Districts Board precisely in the same
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0328"/>
<col>643</col>
way as he would if sitting in his proper place in the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. Perhaps he has a little more freedom from official control, but I have been far too long in the public service to think that freedom from official control is in the long run of advantage. I do not think that any advantage will come from this splitting up of work and multiplication of Departments. You have already a high-paid establishment and officers able to do the work; yet the proposal is to leave these duties with a Board by whom they cannot properly be looked after and where they must be in the hands of one official.</p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02681"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OP CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend has attempted by his Amendment to reinsert the words relating both to industries and fisheries. In what he said he devoted himself mainly to the question of fisheries. I understand that it is known to many of your Lordships that this is a subject on which opinion is no doubt somewhat divided in Ireland. The view expressed by my noble friend is that it is a simple and easy thing to place the care of all the fisheries in Ireland&#x2014;and I will explain directly that the word "fisheries" has in Ireland a somewhat different meaning from what it has in this country&#x2014;in one hand. Unless I am greatly mistaken many people in Ireland think that it is not wise to attempt to treat the fisheries on the East coast and on the West coast in precisely the same manner and on the same lines, and that the division between East and West which the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, regretted has to be recognised in some cases&#x2014;and this is one of them&#x2014;as a practical fact. The real difference, I take it, is to some extent this, that so far as the East coast is concerned the care of fisheries means very much what it does on the English Board presided over by my noble friend behind me; but on the West coast, at any rate in many parts, there is a great deal more to be done. Work has to be done which is kindred to the work performed in other respects by the Congested Districts Board; that is to say, the assistance of fishing as an industry by promoting modes of sale, processes of curing, and things of the kind have to be carried out by whatever
<col>644</col>
body is responsible for the care of the fisheries in that district. That is the kind of work which does not fall naturally under such a Department as a Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. My noble friend has nothing to do with these matters in this country. Neither would it seem natural that the Board of Agriculture should have those duties in Ireland. It no doubt is desirable, where you can, to avoid overlapping, but you must be careful in your desire to do so not to find yourselves dealing with two different things as though they were the same thing, and that, I am afraid, would be the result of my noble friend's Amendment. We think that as the Board is now designed and with the area over which it operates it is desirable to leave it both the power to deal with industries other than purely agricultural industries, and also with fisheries within the domain of which it has charge.</membercontribution></p>

I venture to think that the argument of the noble Earl goes rather further than perhaps he quite realises. Practically his argument is that the Department is not a fit body to administer fisheries in the West of Ireland because it is not charged with these somewhat paternal duties. But the subjects that are transferred by the Government's Bill&#x2014;agriculture, and so forth&#x2014;will have to be dealt with in the congested districts undoubtedly in rather a paternal manner.</membercontribution></p>

We have been told over and over again that the demand for land within the congested districts is likely before the problem can be said to be in any way solved to be so great that it is not safe to leave any land there altogether out of the area to be covered by the operations of the Board. The real point is that, without supposing that land of the kind which the noble Earl mentions is likely to be necessarily bought on a very large scale, it is of the first importance that the Estates Commissioners should be in certain circumstances empowered to obtain the particular piece of land they require for the relief of congestion in a particular area. I need not argue again all the considerations which make that important&#x2014;the considerations of distance, the desirability of not migrating people more than can be helped, and considerations

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02713"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: I move to substitute "Court" for "Judicial Commissioner" in the first subsection of Clause 64 as the tribunal of appeal against a proposal of compulsory acquisition. This Amendment is made to introduce a series of clauses which are down in my name, and I think it will be better if I add a few words explaining what the condition of things is in the Bill and the changes which are to be introduced by my proposed clauses. As the Bill stands at present it is competent for the Land Commission, having made an offer to an owner, if he refuses to take that offer, to take the land compulsorily without anybody's approval and on their own mere motion. I have before remarked that such a power is not conferred on any body inside the British Empire. The Congested Districts Board, in the same way, are empowered, after making an offer to an owner, and in the event of his refusing to accept their offer, of their own motion and without anybody's consent or authority to call upon the Land Commission to acquire compulsorily the land they desire to buy. That is, if possible, a still greater anomaly than the other. And having put in force this power, it is left to the Judicial Commissioner, with the aid of two assessors, to fix the price. In the discussions that took place in your Lordships' House objections were urged to those provisions so strongly that it was quite impossible for noble Lords on this side of the House to accept them or anything resembling them.<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to remember that by the Amendments which we have already moved in Clause 31, the Estates Commissioners are confined, in their acquisition of land compulsorily outside the congested districts, to employ it for the purpose of relieving congestion. They can only
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0331"/>
<col>649</col>
buy congested estates and such untenanted land as is necessary for the relief of congestion on those estates. It should also be borne in mind that, according to the Amendment which has been moved to Clause 55, the Congested Districts Board when they shall henceforth acquire land, can only use it for selling parcels of it to proprietors or tenants of holdings and herdsmen. As far as the land which they have already acquired is concerned, they can deal with that under Section 75 of the Act of 1903. There is another matter which requires to be borne in mind. In the Bill as it originally stood there was a definition of untenanted land by which it appeared that land held under fee-farm grant, or lease for lives renewable for ever, or lease of which sixty years remained to run, should be treated as untenanted land. That definition has been altered, and now land so situated is only to be treated as untenanted for the purpose of the Evicted Tenants Act. It should be remembered also that the definition of Purchase Acts is so altered as to include all the Land Purchase Acts. It is necessary to bear these things in mind to appreciate what it is these compulsory clauses can operate upon, and to what purpose the land acquired by means of them can be devoted.<lb/>
By my proposed new clauses it is provided than an application to restrain the Estates Commissioners from acquiring land may be made to a Court composed of two Judges of the King's Bench Division taken from the rota and the Judicial Commissioner. There are four grounds on which such application can be made: (1) that other land sufficient and equally suitable can be acquired by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price; (2) that the estate or Untenanted land consists of or includes land in the occupation of the owner which is, or forms part of, a park, garden, pleasure ground, recreation ground, demesne, or home farm, or was purchased under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869, for a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;2,000; (3) that the estate or untenanted land consists of or includes land which has been purchased under the Land Purchase Acts, or is the property of a local authority, or is held by any corporation or company for the purposes of a railway, dock, canal, water, or other public undertaking: and (4) that if the estate or untenanted land is acquired as proposed
<col>650</col>
other land of the owner adjoining the estate or untenanted land will be injuriously affected or the amenity of the owner's residence will be impaired.<lb/>
For this purpose the Court will have all the powers of a Court of Chancery, and they will have absolute discretion as to the mode in which they award costs. They will also have another very important power to which noble Lords on this side of the House attach perhaps more importance than to any other part of the Bill&#x2014;namely, they can fix the price. I do not myself admire the word "price" used in such connection. I think the word "compensation" would be a better one. At any rate "price" has been used, and it is pretty clear that the meaning is that they are to take into consideration the full value of the land to its owner. Almost in every case where an objection is lodged on the first of the four grounds on which such applications can be made, it will be necessary for the Court to inquire more or less into the value of the land, and they will be in such cases in a position, without much difficulty, to fix what is the fair price having regard to its value to the owner. But it may be that in some cases the price will be the only matter really in controversy, or it may be that in some cases where several objections are made price is one of them. The others objections may be removed and the price may become the sole remaining question in dispute, and in such cases it might be desirable that the Court should be empowered, if it thinks that the question of price could be better and more appropriately settled by an arbitrator, to refer the fixing of the price to an arbitrator. Therefore, when the price is the sole matter in dispute or the sole remaining matter in dispute, on the application of one of the parties interested, other than the Estates Commissioners or the Congested Districts Board, it will be better for the Court to send the question to an arbitrator appointed by themselves and allow him to fix the price. That is the scheme embodied in these Amendments, and I think they provide a satisfactory and just tribunal.<lb/>
This tribunal would have the confidence of parties on both sides, and would be un-doubtedly competent to fix the price. Contrast it, for instance, with the tribunal set up by the Bill. The tribunal in the Bill would consist of one of the persons
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0332"/>
<col>651</col>
mentioned in my Amendment, who would be flanked on each side by two assessors whose function it would be to disagree with him and overrule him on many occasions, because it would be impossible for him to stand up on questions of mere value against the two assessors sitting with him. The only objection that can be raised to the tribunal which I propose is that it is not fitted to fix the price. One of its members is so fitted by the confession of the Government themselves, because they have appointed him already without assessors to fix prices under the Evicted Tenants Act. I am unable to see how any reasonable objection can be raised to this tribunal, always assuming that it is the object of the Government to appoint an independent tribunal capable of gaining confidence, and efficient, adequate, and well equipped for the discharge of its duties.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02715"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am very sorry we do not find ourselves in closer touch with noble Lords opposite as regards this particular Amendment, and I am afraid that the position with regard to it is a somewhat serious one, because we are not convinced by the very full and complete arguments of the noble and learned Lord opposite that on the occasions where compulsory powers have to be exercised, they can be exercised with reasonable speed and reasonable cheapness under the proposals which he has embodied in his Amendment. We are afraid&#x2014;and nothing that has been said gives me reason to alter the opinion&#x2014;that the zareba, if I may adopt the phrase of the noble Marquess, that has been erected round this is so high and the thorns in it are so pointed that nobody will be able to get through. We believe if the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord were to be embodied in the Bill that in fact compulsion would not be used, and the result would be, where, for instance, it was a question of relieving congestion outside the area, that instead of acquiring the particular piece of land that they might desire to acquire and which would settle the matter satisfactorily, the Estates Commissioners would be placed in the position of having to acquire by agreement some land altogether unsuitable to the purpose, with the further choice of leaving the hard case alone altogether.<lb/>
<col>652</col>
The proposal of the noble and learned Lord is, I think everybody will agree, an extremely elaborate one. The grounds of objection are very numerous, and to take the first, the fact that the Commissioners have to say that it is not possible to obtain in the neighbourhood&#x2014;indeed, not necessarily in the neighbourhood, because it might be held that distant land was equally suitable&#x2014;land which would answer their purpose equally well, involves a possible inquiry by this tribunal into the whole geography of the neighbourhood, with the necessity of inquiring not merely into the price of the land proposed to be taken, but also the price of all the other land within a considerable area around. Then in paragraph (<i>b</i>) there is the provision which excludes land which was purchased under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869. I admit that by placing a &#x00A3;2,000 limit upon that the noble and learned Lord has prevented the worst excesses which might conceivably have happened under that Act, because I fancy there is no doubt that there were some considerable tracts purchased under the Irish Church Act which could not reasonably be excluded from compulsory purchase if that were necessary. Then the noble Lord, in adopting the words of the Lands Clauses Act in relation to lands injuriously affected, opens out, and means to open out, a very wide area of objection on the part of a landlord.<lb/>
But, my Lords, our principal objection, as the noble and learned Lord foresaw, is to the composition of the tribunal. We proposed that the Judicial Commissioner, with two expert assistants or assessors, whatever you may please to call them, should sit on the case and fix the price. I have never been able to understand what the particular objection was to the assessors named by us in our Bill&#x2014;whether it was supposed that people would be appointed who were entirely ignorant of the subject, or whether it was supposed that persons might be appointed who held the view that there ought to be no private property in land. I should have supposed that it was possible to find a great many gentlemen in Ireland who were thoroughly competent to sit with the Judicial Commissioner for such a purpose, and who would, I believe, have inspired general confidence in doing so. But personally I have never regarded the assessors as an integral part of the proposal, and if it had been proposed that the Judicial Commissioner should sit alone, I think we should have endeavoured to meet noble Lords opposite
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0333"/>
<col>653</col>
in that respect. I can recall no precedent or analogy for the proposal made in the Amendment; I cannot remember any enactment containing anything like it&#x2014;that is to say, that two Judges of the High Court should be called upon, on evidence brought before them, to fix the price of an estate&#x2014;and nothing has been said by noble Lords opposite to induce the Government to believe that this tribunal can from any point of view be regarded as reasonable for the particular purpose to be carried out.

I quite recognise that this is a serious matter, and I would recall to your Lordships' memory that noble Lords from Ireland resisted from the beginning the principle of compulsion in the Bill. The House decided otherwise, and we have accepted the position. I think the noble Earl is unduly alarmed at the somewhat long Amendment which the noble and learned Lord has on the Paper when he said that the zareba erected round this subject by the noble and learned Lord was
<col>654</col>
so high and that the thorns in it were so pointed that nobody would be able to get through. That there is no analogy to this proposal is not surprising, because in Ireland there is passing a transition of land from one class to another such as has no parallel. What we ask for, compulsion having been granted, is a Court to which all parties should be able to go and demand that justice to which everybody is entitled. That is really what it all amounts to. Are we to be told that the Bill is to be lost because we make this reasonable demand? We who come from Ireland and who are put under this Bill have taken the situation in a generous manner, and I hardly think that the noble Earl has been fair to us on this point. I hope that noble Lords from Ireland will insist upon this Court of Appeal, which is a proper one to place in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02720"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: It is with the greatest regret that I listened to the speech of the noble Earl opposite. So far everything seemed to have been going on satisfactorily in the negotiations which have been conducted with regard to this Bill. Concessions have been made on both sides, and I think those made on this side of the House have largely exceeded those made by His Majesty's Government. But the whole point&#x2014;the pivot&#x2014;on which these concessions turn is the necessity for an impartial and competent tribunal to decide the question of price, and I must honestly say we do not consider the tribunal proposed in the Bill by His Majesty's Government to be a competent one. I do not like to repeat what I have already said, but I mentioned to your Lordships at an earlier stage a case in which the Judicial Commissioner thought twelve years purchase a sufficient price to give to a landowner who was compulsorily dispossessed under the Evicted Tenants Act. We do not consider that this is giving a landowner the fair annual value of his land. I should like to impress on the House how very important it is that we should make a stand for this tribunal in view of the possibility of the principle of compulsory purchase being extended to the whole of Ireland. If we accept an incompetent tribunal in the present case, it will be impossible, when compulsion is extended over a larger area, to have a reformed tribunal. The noble Marquess who leads the Opposition gave us on every occasion the most confident assurance that he would be no party to the passing of this
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0334"/>
<col>655</col>
Bill unless every device was adopted which should secure that in the case of land taken compulsorily the owner should be fully safeguarded. When the Bill goes back to the House of Commons it should be made clear that, however much we should regret the Bill being lost, believing as we do that it will be for the advantage of Ireland, we consider this competent and impartial tribunal essential, and that if the Bill should come back from another place with a tribunal which is not satisfactory to us, we should feel bound in that case, at whatever sacrifice, to declare that we could not make further concessions in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02721"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I rise for the purpose of expressing the great regret with which I listened to the chilling reception which the noble Earl opposite has accorded to this Amendment. I was certainly not under the impression that he would in any way bless it, but I had a hope that he would recognise the immense importance which we attach to it and that he would have realised that the points upon which we have been able to meet him would not have been conceded unless we had been under the impression that upon this all-important point he was ready to meet us. We put this requirement in the very forefront of our proposals. We believe that in this matter we are fighting for a principle, a principle which we find ourselves called upon to defend not in this Bill only. That principle is that when Parliament passes legislation under which owners of property, whether they be private owners or local authorities, are to have that property interfered with or taken from them, the parties aggrieved should be afforded some security at all events that the necessity of the treatment meted out to them and the terms upon which they are compensated shall be considered by an independent and competent tribunal. What it seems to me we are acquiring an evil habit of doing is that we pass legislation of this kind, we entrust the administration of it to a Government Department, sometimes presided over by an enthusiastic Minister, and inspired by enthusiastic feelings, and we give to the Minister or to the Department an absolutely free hand to interfere with the rights of owners of property. To that growing practice it is, I conceive, our duty to offer a strong opposition.<lb/>
The noble Earl recommended to us a tribunal which he suggested as one more
<col>656</col>
suitable to the requirements of the case than the tribunal advocated by my noble and learned friend behind me. We have explained very clearly the nature of our objection to the tribunal advocated by the noble Earl. He relies, and naturally relies, upon the high qualifications of Mr. Justice Wylie. But may I remind the noble Earl that he cannot give us any security that Mr. Justice Wylie will always hold the position he at present holds; and when we are told that we are to rely not only on him but on the two assessors whom the noble Earl proposes to give him, are we not justified in saying we know nothing about those assessors? We have no security that they will not be gentlemen of very decided political views. Unfortunately, it is the case in Ireland&#x2014;and no one knows it better than the noble Earl&#x2014;that it is not very easy to find gentlemen who are regarded as thoroughly impartial. What is the noble Earl's objection to the tribunal which my noble and learned friend proposes? He criticised it upon several points of detail, into which I will not now enter except for the purpose of saying this, that if it had only been a question of detailed consideration of the subsections contained in my noble and learned friend's Amendment, we should have been perfectly ready to discuss those with him on their merits.<lb/>
But it is said that these two Judges to whom a place is proposed to be given on the tribunal would know nothing about land. Possibly they might be learned Judges who might have no particular claim to expert knowledge of land; but are learned Judges never called upon to adjudicate upon technical matters of which they have no special acquaintance of their own; and are they not able in such cases to supply any deficiencies on their own part by hearing the evidence which is brought forward on the technical points by the parties concerned. Then the noble Earl said that a tribunal of this kind would occasion needless delay, and he indicated to us very plainly indeed that what is in the contemplation of His Majesty's Government is that land should be taken under this Bill by what I can only describe as the most rough-and-ready methods&#x2014;methods in which short cuts will be taken and very scant justice done to the parties aggrieved. He also, I think, said something of the expense which would be occasioned by a tribunal of this kind. That might be an
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0335"/>
<col>657</col>
excellent argument if this Bill was a cheap Bill. Is it a cheap Bill? You are ladling out enormous sums of money for the purposes of this Bill, and are you really going to stop short at the expenses occasioned by a Court of this kind, merely because there are added a few hundred pounds to the total expense of this measure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02722"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is the general expense involved to the parties by the employment of expensive counsel, such as are always employed before a tribunal of this kind, that I had mainly in mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02723"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I ask the noble Earl to remember that what you are going to do under this Bill is an extremely violent thing. You are going to take away from people property which belongs to them as much as the coat on their back belongs to them; and it seems to me really idle to suggest that in a case of this kind you are not to give proper and adequate safeguards to the persons aggrieved merely because there may be a little delay or a little more expense involved. I greatly regret that at this point, which is one which seems to us of vital importance, the noble Earl has not been able to say something which would reassure our minds and mitigate the deep misgivings and anxieties with which this part of the policy of His Majesty's Government is not unnaturally regarded.</membercontribution></p>

I merely wish to ask His Majesty's Government whether they cannot see their way to accept the clause. It would involve no expense whatever to the Treasury, and is merely an enabling clause to empower landlords to compensate their agents when land is taken away compulsorily. The noble Earl said when this matter was discussed on the Third Reading of this Bill that in cases of the sale of land held in fee simple the money would go to the vendor, and he would be able to deal with his agent in this matter; but there are very few estates held in fee simple in Ireland. The other fear of the noble Earl was that an Amendment of this kind would raise the price. But this provision has entered into the consideration of all negotiations for sale by voluntary agreement. I think the noble Earl may rest assured that his fear will be groundless. The clause involves no cost to the Treasury and only gives power to do certain things with the consent of the vendor and the Land Commission.

The main argument which we use is that

The noble Lord, as we see, agrees to admit those tenants who lost their status under what was known as the Eviction-Made-Easy Clause of the Act of 1887, where mere notice took the place of ejectment. But there are certain other tenants who did not technically become evicted tenants. There is the case where a present tenancy was put up for sale and the landlord bought it, without in many cases any money passing, the mere effect being to wipe out a certain quantity of arrears and to change the status of the tenant. In such cases, which are not very numerous, is it worth while to leave those people out and to leave a very limited number of persons with something like a grievance, or what they consider a grievance, in order to save what may be regarded from the point of view of noble Lords opposite as an injustice? If noble Lords could show that there were a great number of cases where the landlord had actually bought a tenancy and paid for it, the argument would be a strong one. In the circumstances I would ask the noble Lord not to press his Amendments, because we think that if this question of future tenants is to be dealt with at all it is desirable that it should be dealt with completely.</membercontribution></p>

I do not know whether my noble friend intends to press his Amendment or not, but I hope the noble Earl will take note of the fact that this is a very large concession&#x2014;I believe a far larger concession than any which has been made on either side up to now.

But am I to understand from the noble Earl that the clause as he wishes it to run would convert a future tenant whose interest had been acquired by the landlord for a valuable consideration&#x2014;would convert him by a stroke of the pen into a present tenant? That seems to me to be rather a strong order. The noble Earl has told us that the cases were not numerous.

I admitted just now that if it could be shown that there were a number of cases where landlords had bought the tenancies of present tenants and paid for them in cash, the case would be very much stronger than it is.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02805"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had hoped that as a first step in the proceedings of this afternoon the noble Earl the Lord Steward would have been good enough to have made some statement as to how your Lordships' House stands with respect to these Amendments, but I suppose he is reserving his eloquence for a future opportunity. Your Lordships are aware that this Bill has been the subject not only of very careful and elaborate consideration and discussion in your Lordships' House, but there have also been discussions outside, and as a result of those discussions your Lordships will see that a large number of Amendments stand in the name of His Majesty's Government upon the Order Paper. It may be asked whether some of us who sit on this Bench have been made aware of these Amendments. As a matter of fact, that is so. We have been made aware of them. The question may then be asked whether we are satisfied with those
<col>668</col>
Amendments. The answer is emphatically in the negative; we are not satisfied. But before your Lordships come to deal with them, perhaps I might say one or two words as to what those Amendments involve.<lb/>
As I have said, we are not satisfied in any degree with the Amendments which His Majesty's Government have offered us. The noble Earl and the other members of His Majesty's Government with whom we have come in contact have been, of course, as they always are, very courteous in their dealings with us, but they have not been very conciliatory&#x2014;quite a different thing. The main feature of this Bill, with which many of your Lordships did not agree during the discussions on the various stages of the Bill, has been the supreme position which is accorded to the Local Government Board. In a large measure that supremacy remains but in certain particulars concessions have been made. In the first place, we have the important statement laid down by an Amendment moved from this side of the House and which is to be accepted, that in any housing scheme which is forced upon a local authority the Local Government Board shall have regard to the necessities of the case and the burden of the rates before they use their compulsory powers. But that is not the most important matter in respect of housing which appears upon the Amendments now before your Lordships. There is the fact that the Government concede that in respect of urban districts the powers of compulsory purchase shall only be exercised after an impartial inquiry, and that unless the Government agree with the findings of the impartial inquiry the matter shall be referred to the judgment of the two Houses of Parliament. That is a matter for which we contended very warmly, and which we have succeeded in obtaining. It is very substantial, because, as your Lordships know, "urban districts" is a phrase which covers a great deal more than the areas absolutely occupied by towns. The phrase covers not only the towns themselves, but the large country districts which surround the towns&#x2014;namely, those districts in which a large part of the housing operations ought to and must take place; and within the whole of those areas the terms of your Lordships' Amendment on Clause 2 are, in all important features, accepted by His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
That is an important matter in itself, but it is more important in its principle even
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0341"/>
<col>669</col>
than in its substance, because it is a confession by His Majesty's Government that what may be called "Small Holdings" terms are not of universal application. It admits that the <i>ipse dixit</i> of a Government Department is not sufficient to justify the taking of land in urban districts; that you cannot rely upon the impartiality of a Government Department in respect of urban districts. That appears to me to be a very-important admission, because it is rather difficult to see the actual position which His Majesty's Government henceforward occupy. A Government Department cannot be impartial in urban districts. Why, then, should they be expected to be impartial in rural districts? And if they cannot be trusted in the matter of compulsory purchase in urban districts as between themselves and the landowners, why should we be content to trust them to impose their will upon local authorities? The moment the admission is made which the Government have made, that small holdings terms are not of universal application, that the impartiality of a Government Department cannot be relied upon, then the position they occupy in forcing the wishes of Government Departments on local authorities in rural districts remains altogether without defence. That is a very important dilemma in which we have placed His Majesty's Government, and it will be very important when we come to consider precedents in the future.<lb/>
Then there is the question of town planning. Now in respect of town planning, the Amendments upon the Paper now before us contain an admission that town-planning schemes shall not become law without having lain for thirty days upon the Table of the House of Commons and of your Lordships' House, during which time either House of Parliament may object, and, if they object, the town-planning scheme becomes null and void. I think that is a very important matter which the action of your Lordships' House has won in regard to this Bill, because in important town-planning schemes it will be a real, serious, and important check upon any action of which we might have to complain by the Local Government Board. I do not mean to contend that it is in any way equal to the careful inquiry which your Lordships would have wished to take place in a matter of this kind&#x2014;I do not say necessarily by means of Provisional Order, but in some way or other there ought to be a detailed examination
<col>670</col>
of these town-planning schemes. That has not been obtained, but one tribunal is permitted by the favour of His Majesty's Government to have control over town-planning schemes, and that is the tribunal of the High Court of Parliament. Whenever any town-planning scheme is proposed of which any persons have a right to complain, those persons can plead their cause through the mouth of a member of your Lordships' House, and if that advocacy prevails, then your Lordships will have it in your power to prevent such a town-planning scheme becoming law.<lb/>
Those are important concessions, but there is another department in which I had hoped we should have been successful&#x2014;namely, in securing to an aggrieved person who thinks he has a right to complain of the decision of a local authority in the matter of the provision of housing accommodation a full hearing by a Court of Justice. That the Government have refused. They show a remarkable reluctance to allow the matters which arise under this Bill to be tried by an impartial Court of Justice. I think that is one of the most striking developments of modern Liberal policy. I am not surprised, perhaps, that the Local Government Board, who naturally fight for their own end, should desire to make themselves supreme; but I confess it has been a shock to me that the head of the Judicature of this country should have been willing to allow the Courts of Justice to be superseded by an administrative Department. Not only will an aggrieved person not have a right to approach a Court of Justice&#x2014;a cheap Court of Justice such as we had proposed&#x2014;but the greatest pains had been taken by the Government, until your Lordships intervened, to eliminate any judicial element in what is being tried under the provisions of this Bill. Counsel are not to be permitted to plead before any tribunal, so far as the Government can prevent them. If the Government Department violate an Act of Parliament, the Government have inserted words to prevent that being brought before the highest Courts of the Realm. That has been done with the authority of the Lord Chancellor, and it has been a great shock to me to find he has so little confidence and faith in the great profession which he adorns and over which he presides that he has been a consenting party to this provision in the Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0342"/>
<col>671</col>
But though we have not been successful in obtaining all that we desired, at any rate we have made a sufficient impression on His Majesty's Government to make the proceedings of the Local Government Board inspector, to whom these appeals must go, of a judicial character. That is a substantial matter, upon which I think your Lordships' House is to be congratulated. I believe I am entitled to say that the noble Earl the Lord Steward will make a declaration at the proper time in which he will state that the Local Government Board inspector will be publicly instructed to allow the parties as of right fuller opportunities than they would have under the ordinary procedure of a Local Government Board inquiry, and that the Local Government Board inspector himself will be directed to make an impartial inquiry. I think it is a striking circumstance that the Government should have been willing to direct the Local Government Board inspector to make an impartial report. One would have thought that that would have followed as a matter of course; but, at any rate, the Local Government Board inspector, when he has received this instruction, will no doubt feel that he must approach these particular inquiries in a different spirit from what he would under ordinary circumstances. I do not for a moment desire to say that Local Government Board inspectors are not men of the highest integrity. Of course they are. I have no doubt, whether these instructions were given them or not, they would do their best to fulfil their duty. But I think they will realise that the fact that these express words are laid upon them places these inquiries upon a different footing from the ordinary inquiries which they are called upon to carry out. Those are important matters. Upon betterment, what is called a compromise has been arrived at. Well, it is a compromise of a sort&#x2014;that is to say, that whereas under the Government proposal all the benefit arising from a particular town-planning scheme was to have gone to the local authority, now it is to be divided in two parts, half to go to the local authority and half to go to the owner of the land, though half of what no human being has been able to make out, and the Government absolutely refuse to put in any words by which that particular fact can be arrived at.<lb/>
I have ventured to sketch very briefly,
<col>672</col>
and, of course, not by any means exhaustively, what is involved in the Amendments which the Government have tabled and which are now before the House. I do not ask your Lordships, as I have said, to be satisfied with what has been achieved, but I do think&#x2014;and there I speak with great diffidence and ask your Lordships' pardon if I go beyond my duty in saying so&#x2014;I do think your Lordships will be wise to consent to these Amendments as they stand. Why do I say so? I say so, in the first place, because of the substantial advantages which we have gained, and which I venture to describe; in the second place, because something has been gained by the debates which have taken place in this House beyond those substantial advantages&#x2014;namely, a public testimony to the expert knowledge and care which your Lordships have brought to bear upon the discussion of these intricate subjects of social improvement; and, in the third place, because I think it is of the highest importance that no misunderstanding should exist in the public mind as to the sympathy of your Lordships' House with the great object of the better housing of the people and the better development of the great urban community of this country. We are all of us interested in this subject. It is a subject which has been made peculiarly the province of a Conservative Statesman in the past, and we should be false to the traditions left to us if we did not in our own time do our best ourselves to promote these great objects. Moreover, it is not merely that we desire to promote these objects. We desire that the people of this country should know that we have this ambition, and that they should realise the sympathy which your Lordships have with these objects. We are placed in this position. Undoubtedly if we refused these Amendments and this Bill were not to become law, it would be in many men's mouths throughout the country that your Lordships did not really sympathise with the better housing of the people and did not really desire to promote the proper extension of the great urban communities of this country. It would be a profound disaster if that belief became common amongst the poor of this country, and therefore I venture to think that we should be wise in accepting for what they are worth the substantial concessions which we have obtained, and in allowing our sympathy with these great objects which
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0343"/>
<col>673</col>
I have described to prevail over the natural indignation which we feel that the reasonable Amendments which we have put forward have not been accepted by His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
I have only one word more to say. There is in my belief no finality in legislation. The subject of housing and town planning is not finished; it is only beginning; and at a future time, perhaps when other noble Lords occupy the Bench opposite, there will be an opportunity of reconsidering the decisions which your Lordships may arrive at this afternoon. If that be so and when that be so, I earnestly hope that the decision at which your Lordships will arrive will be more consistent with the traditions of legislation in this country, more consistent with the freedom of local government in the various counties, more consistent with the right of any aggrieved individual to go before and obtain justice from the Courts in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02806"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to follow the noble Marquess at any length in the general observations which he has made. The Amendments as taken one by one will speak for themselves, and noble Lords will be able to judge from the attitude of my noble friend behind me how far the noble Marquess was justified in stating that we had not shown a conciliatory attitude. The noble Marquess's idea of conciliation on the part of his opponents, as I have had reason to know on previous occasions, consists in a complete and abject surrender on their part to every proposal, however extravagant, which he may have thought it right to put forward. As a matter of fact, I think the House will realise, as we go through the Amendments, that my noble friend behind me and the Government have shown a desire to meet, so far as was possible without destroying the principles on which the Bill is based, the views of noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
There is only one point of detail on which the noble Marquess spoke on which I should desire to say a word&#x2014;that is with regard to the differentiation to which we have agreed for the treatment of land proposed to be taken in urban and in rural districts, what are known as small holdings terms being retained in our rural
<col>674</col>
areas, and a further appeal to an outside authority being given in the case of urban districts. The noble Marquess made a dialectical point upon that which, I think, was hardly worthy of him, and which, although I dislike doing so, I am prepared to characterise as almost absurd. The noble Marquess said that this differentiation was a confession on our part that the Local Government Board could not be regarded as an impartial authority where it was a case of taking urban land for this purpose, although apparently we regarded it as impartial in the case of rural districts. That, if I may say so, is obviously a false point. It is not a question of impartiality on the one side or the other. It is a question of the possible magnitude of the transaction. We obviously are quite content, because we brought in the Bill in that form, to trust the impartiality of the Local Government Board either in town or in country. Noble Lords opposite, I understand, argued that the two things could not be considered as exactly alike, and that it was not the same thing to desire to take a considerable quantity of very highly priced land in relation to an urban scheme as it might be to take a few acres for rural housing. I do not propose to argue whether that is a sound distinction or not, but at any rate we have so far admitted that there may be something in it. But to speak of that as showing our mistrust of the impartiality of the Local Government Board is really not fair, because the proper analogy, of which countless instances could be given, is the well known one that in cases where large transactions are involved it is very frequent to give a further appeal, which is not given where only smaller matters are concerned.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess spoke of our indifference to the claims of justice in the matter of the tribunal, and alluded in terms of depreciation to my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack for not having stood up for the Courts of Law. My noble and learned friend thought, and I believe a great many other people also thought, that the tribunal suggested by the noble Marquess opposite&#x2014;the County Courts&#x2014;was a thoroughly unsuitable tribunal for the purpose; not that County Court Judges were incompetent men, but that you would get a great variety of decisions, which was highly undesirable in a matter of this kind, and also that the proper work of the County Courts would be seriously hampered by
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0344"/>
<col>675</col>
throwing these additional duties upon them. However, our attitude apparently caused a severe shock to the noble Marquess and his friends opposite. We also had a severe shock. It was a shock to us to find the apparent indifference shown by the noble Marquess and his friends to the rolling up of expenditure by elaborate procedure. That was a shock to us, and as we both received shocks on this subject, I think perhaps, as we have managed to survive them, we had better now proceed to the consideration of the Amendments one by one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02807"><member>VISCOUNT CROSS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only desire to intervene for a few moments. It fell to my lot as long ago as 1875 to bring forward the Artisans' Dwellings Act, which I believe was the first measure which really took this matter in hand on anything like a large scale. An enormous difference has been made in London in consequence of the passing of that Act, and although I am quite aware that it has cost a good deal to the local authorities, the permanent advantages of that Act will remain for a long time to come. I only say that because I wish to add that I am delighted to see this Bill brought forward by His Majesty's Government. I think it would be a great calamity if it were not to pass into law, and I entirely agree with what the noble Marquess behind me said on that point. My advice I add to his, that these Amendments as they appear should be accepted by the Opposition in order that the Bill may pass without further delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02808"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to add one word only to what has been said by my noble friend behind me. These Amendments are, as he has explained to the House, the outcome of discussions which have taken place not in the House but outside it. As to this I may say the procedure which has had to be followed in the case of this Bill and also in the case of the Irish Land Bill seems to me in many respects a by no means satisfactory form of procedure. Those who are entrusted with the conduct of these negotiations are not plenipotentiaries. They have to assume very heavy responsibilities. They often find themselves exposed to a rather galling cross fire, directed at them partly by those who sit on the other side of the House and partly by their habitual supporters, who very naturally are not always able to see eye
<col>676</col>
to eye with them with regard to the different proposals with which they have to deal. But this procedure is, I am afraid, inevitable under a system by which the work of this House is brought before it late in the session, and when our opportunities of examining much controverted Bills are as restricted as they are. It comes really to this, that unless the House is prepared to lose Bills of which in the main it really approves, and which it desires to see passed into law, it must consent to some rough and ready expedient for reconciling apparently irreconcilable differences between the two sides of the House.<lb/>
I wish to take up one statement which was made by the noble Earl who addressed us just now. He spoke of our Amendments as being many of them inconsistent with the principle of the Bill. I do not think that any of the Amendments which we put on the Paper can really be so represented. Our Amendments&#x2014;I do not wish to go over the ground again&#x2014;our more important Amendments were all of them directed to one object, that of affording both to aggrieved owners and occupiers of land and also to aggrieved local authorities an adequate measure of protection from the arbitrary action of a public Department. And when I say the arbitrary action of a public Department, pray do not let it be supposed that I am imputing anything like improper partiality either to the Statesman who presides over the Local Government Board or to any of the colleagues of the noble Earl opposite. But our point is this, that these Ministers and those who act with them must, by the necessity of the case, be in a sense partisans. They are engaged in these long discussions preparatory to the preparation of schemes under this and other Bills, and it is impossible that at the last moment they and those who act for them should approach the question in an absolutely detached frame of mind and in a thoroughly judicial spirit. We are fighting for the old, old principle, that you should, as far as your opportunities permit you, separate judicial from executive and administrative functions, and therefore I repudiate the suggestion that we have been in any way opposing the principle of the Bill. The principle of the Bill is that we should do all we can to improve the housing accommodation of the working classes and to ameliorate the conditions under which our great urban communities are allowed to expand, and that principle is one which entirely commends
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0345"/>
<col>677</col>
itself to us, and which we have done and will do our utmost to support.<lb/>
My noble friend has explained clearly the extent to which we have succeeded in effecting our purpose. At one point we have failed conspicuously&#x2014;the point to which the noble Earl referred just now&#x2014;I mean in obtaining access to the County Courts for persons aggrieved by housing or demolition schemes. The noble Earl told us that in his view the County Court was a very inappropriate tribunal to go to. Upon that our mind was quite open. We made it clear during the discussions that if noble Lords opposite objected to the County Court and would offer us any other form of procedure we would entertain the proposal with an open mind. I say that merely because I do not wish to appear as wedded to the County Court procedure. We got all that we could. We, of course, could not expect to remove all the blots which we detected in the Government's Bill. We accept the Bill as now proposed by noble Lords opposite, and I trust, although I have no right to commit those who sit behind me, that they will not disapprove of the arrangement arrived at. But I remain of opinion&#x2014;and I trust noble Lords opposite will pardon me for expressing it strongly&#x2014;that they have made a great mistake in not meeting us further than they have upon the points for which we principally contended. To me it has always seemed that in legislation of this kind, dealing necessarily with important interests&#x2014;the interests not only of owners and occupiers but of great as well as small local municipalities&#x2014;it was desirable, from the point of view of the Government themselves, that everything should be done that could be done to reassure the public and disarm the suspicions to which interference of the kind contemplated by such legislation as this must inevitably give rise. Some of those suspicions I trust we have been able to remove; some of them remain; and if they do remain the fault is not ours but that of noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02809"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: As it is desired to proceed to the consideration of the Amendments on the Paper I will only say one word, which is called for, I think, by the strictures of the noble Marquess who opened the debate with regard to my own attitude. The noble Marquess has an hereditary right to be jealous of the administration of justice in this country, and I join entirely with him in thinking that the administration
<col>678</col>
of justice by the Courts of this country is pure and of the highest value to the State. I think, further, that it is one of the main bulwarks of the security and stability of this country. I hope that I would be one of the very last to question the competence or efficiency of those Courts. My reason for objecting to the criticism of the noble Marquess, which I do not think imputed so much malignity as improper judgment to myself, is that in the first place it is not the case that persons aggrieved are excluded from the Courts of Justice, as the noble Marquess will find if he will look at the Amendment on page 10. He will there find that on any point of law the person aggrieved is entitled to go to the High Court of Justice. Accordingly, I think, the foundation of his statement falls.<lb/>
The real ground of criticism is that I have objected very strongly to County Courts being entrusted with the duty of saying whether a particular tenement is or is not fit for human habitation. That is not a point of law in any way but a question of fact, which is better ascertained by persons familiar with it than by a High Court Judge or a County Court Judge. The noble Viscount who just now interposed in the debate will remember his own social legislation, all of which was most admirable and excellent. I speak from memory, but the Public Health Act of 1875 is studded with provisions, as are his other Acts, to prevent the expensive and costly machinery of the law being invoked to settle questions of fact such as are contained in this Bill. The law is costly, and proceedings of this kind would lead inevitably to a breakdown of the system if you overburden it with legal expenses, and, above all, with the expenses of costly expert witnesses.<lb/>
My Lords, practical wisdom in legislation depends upon the balance of two French proverbs. One is that the good is the enemy of the better, and the other that the better is the enemy of the good. Your Lordships have to apply good sense in determining which of those proverbs you prefer as the guide for your action in the particular cases that arise. In my own opinion it would be better on this occasion to get a tribunal of a practical kind&#x2014;an inspector with practical experience&#x2014;who can decide this simple thing instead of remitting it to the costly and dignified machinery of the law.</membercontribution></p>

The subject-matter, after the discussions that have taken place in your Lordships' House, is so familiar that it is not necessary for me, especially after what has fallen from the noble Marquess opposite, to say anything with regard to the principle of this Amendment. In these circumstances perhaps it will be unnecessary for me to do more than formally move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>680</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02822"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: I refrained from saying anything upon the general question of the consideration of these Amendments, but I think I cannot allow this Amendment to pass without making some observations upon the nature of it. Surveying the Amendments which are going to be proposed by the noble Earl opposite and the number which he proposes that your Lordships should not insist upon, I am bound to say there seems to me to be a somewhat melancholy reiteration. One after another the noble Earl is going to move that your Lordships do not insist upon this, that and the other Amendment which you have agreed to at former stages of the Bill. The reason which has been given in many cases by the House of Commons for not agreeing to your Lordships' Amendments is that it is desirable to follow the precedent of the Small Holdings Act. Whether your Lordships agree to these Amendments or do not insist upon your own Amendments, I hope at any rate that you will not agree to that reason as the one for which you accept the Amendments put forward by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, because I venture to say that the precedent of the Small Holdings Act has been proved to be an extremely dangerous one to follow.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack a few minutes ago told us that there was a marked difference between questions of law and questions of fact, and that where questions of fact alone were concerned it was most unwise to invoke the expense of an appeal to a Court of Law. But the procedure of the Small Holdings Act, which is embodied in this Bill, and under which the main purchases of land will be effected, does two things to which I venture, not for the first time, to draw your Lordships' attention, because I really think they are a very serious danger in the machinery by which property may be compulsorily acquired. Your Lordships will remember that an Order of the Local Government Board is to be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act have been complied with, and that the Order is within the powers of the Act&#x2014;that is to say, the Local Government Board are at liberty, unwittingly, perhaps, but certainly also wittingly, if they should so choose, to set at nought all the provisions contained in the Act and which they are bound by law to carry out; if any person is aggrieved and challenges
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0347"/>
<col>681</col>
the Order of the Local Government Board, he can only receive one answer from His Majesty's Courts of Law&#x2014;that is, that the Order is to have effect as if it had been enacted in the measure which your Lordships are going to pass to-day. I venture to say that that procedure in the Small Holdings Act is an extremely dangerous one for your Lordships to follow.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite said that some of the proposals put forward by my noble friend the noble Marquess were extravagant. I am bound to say the arguments which were adduced on this side of the House seemed to me to be absolutely conclusive, and certainly met with no answer from the Benches opposite. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill has been most courteous. He showed a knowledge of the subject and a readiness in dealing with it which everyone in this House must have admired; but, at the same time, he had no answer to give to the arguments which were put forward from this side of the House except that the Local Government Board wished the Bill to stand as brought up to this House. As to the Amendment which your Lordships have now before you, if it is to be defended upon the grounds of consistency I confess I never saw an Amendment so absurd in its proposition. The proposition is that in London and in urban districts, you are to call in an independent arbitrator who is to decide certain things; but I think it is not unfair to assume that the intention is where the land is not situated in urban districts or in London, the Local Government Board should be free to make an Order for any lands, however unsuitable, and though they may be acquired with undue detriment to the persons interested or the owners of adjoining land. If it is not right that the Local Government Board should do that in one case, it cannot be right that they should do so in another.<lb/>
After what has fallen from the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, I should, of course, not desire to offer any opposition to this Amendment and the others which are going to be proposed by His Majesty's Government; but I do say this, that I think that in this Bill and in the Small Holdings Act your Lordships' zeal for both of those subjects has, if I may say so with great deference and great respect, somewhat outrun your discretion.
<col>682</col>
I am a strong advocate of small holdings; I am strenuously desirous of seeing the working classes of this country well and decently housed; but I cannot help feeling that in consenting to the procedure proposed by the Small Holdings Act and in this Bill your Lordships are going a long way to destroy confidence in the protection hitherto afforded by Parliament. I think that in the negotiations which have taken place the Government have been very well aware of the feelings which your Lordships entertain upon this point. They know full well that the Housing Acts are all the work of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House, and, most prominently, of the noble Viscount who addressed you just now. They knew quite well that noble Lords on this side would give up a great deal rather than see this Bill sacrificed. I believe, if your Lordships had said you would not accept these principles unless they were subject to considerable modification at the hands of His Majesty's Government, that His Majesty's Government would have been more ready to meet noble Lords on this side of the House than they have proved themselves to be.<lb/>
I was very glad to hear what was said by the noble Marquess who spoke first in this debate. The noble Marquess said that this was not to be the last word upon this subject. He said that he hoped on some other occasion, when noble Lords on this side were occupying the Benches opposite, there might be further legislation. I venture to say that the whole question of the acquisition of land and of carrying out housing and town-planning schemes cannot be allowed to rest where it will be after this Bill has passed into law. It is impossible to say that for purposes of small holdings or of housing you shall be able to adopt a cheap and inexpensive way of obtaining land and that that method should be denied to the great railway companies and other corporations who have to obtain land equally for public purposes; and I venture to think the time must fast be approaching when your Lordships will have to take up this question in a broad and comprehensive spirit, and when you will have to consider whether the present Provisional Order system, the present Private Bill system, is not capable of some cheapening by the provision of some more easy method of obtaining land.<lb/>

I have thought that for some time past, and although I believe that the utmost confidence is felt in the decisions of Committees both of this House and of the other House of Parliament, I still think that, having made this great inroad into the practice of Parliament in that respect your Lordships will have to consider the whole situation, and that at some time or other some independent tribunal will have to be established to deal with all questions of the compulsory acquisition of land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02823"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: I should like to make one observation on a matter of detail. I understand that the question of whether or not persons interested can be represented by counsel at the inquiry is to remain at the discretion of the person who holds the inquiry. I do not doubt that that will be more expeditious; but the question is which will afford the most ample guarantee against any abuse of power. The question of being represented by counsel or not ought to remain in the hands of the litigants and not of the person who holds the inquiry. If the litigants choose to pay for counsel, I cannot see why they should not be allowed to do so. I hope the noble Earl will tell us that that point has been considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02824"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: This seems to me to be a matter which ought to have been brought before your Lordships on the Committee stage rather than at this moment. I think it will be obvious to your Lordships that such a proposal as the noble Earl has just brought forward does run counter to one of the important principles of the Bill, which is to secure that this new procedure should be as cheap as possible. I think we all agree that the introduction of members of the legal profession does not tend to secure that object, and that is why it would be impossible for His Majesty's Government to accept such a suggestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02825"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has said that this matter is one which ought to have been brought forward at the Committee stage.

It is the first time that your Lordships have been asked to consent to placing the great local authorities of the country entirely at the mercy of the President of the Local Government Board in matters of very great expenditure for housing. The effect of this Amendment will be that an expenditure of &#x00A3;2,000,000 on housing under Part III can be forced on the London County Council by the Local Government Board after the ratepayers of London have by a very large majority decided that economy should be made.</membercontribution></p>

it. I think there should be an appeal. There is no appeal in this case. The Order may be laid on the Table of the House, according to the noble Earl's Amendment. The Order may be made in August and for six months the matter may have been running before it is possible that it should even be laid on the Table of your Lordships' House. All we ask in this case is that the Order should be laid on the Table for thirty days, and that opportunity should be given to Parliament to decide as between a great municipality and the Local Government Board as to which is in the right. Up to now there has been no authority over the great municipalities except Parliament itself, and they have relied on the authority of Parliament. If we are to take the Local Government Board as being above all criticism and as the sole judges of the need of housing and of the ratepayers' ability to pay, no doubt the noble Earl is correct in his Amendment; but I must honestly state that in the course of these discussions no remissness in the past in these matters has been urged to justify so gigantic a change. The change is contrary to precedent. His Majesty's Government have failed to support it by argument, and their support in the Division Lobby has been particularly scanty even among their own supporters. I am sure that if the noble Earl would take the opinion of the great municipalities he would find that they are practically unanimous against this proposal, which I hope will not long be allowed to stand on the Statute Book.</membercontribution></p>

is an infringement of the House of Commons privilege. It is one of those cases of extreme and violent assertion of House of Commons privilege which should never be allowed to pass unnoticed in this House. A county council is empowered, under Clause 13, to incur certain expenses and charge them on the general rate. What we proposed was that the county council should be allowed to vary the incidence, not the amount, of the rate, so that instead of falling on the whole county it should fall on a certain area within the county. There is no interference there with the authority that levies the rate and there is no interference with the amount of the rate. It is a simple and narrow question of local administration, and if this view of the House of Commons privilege is to be adopted, your Lordships' House will never be allowed to have a word in any case where the smallest question affecting the incidence of local rates arises.

the Government are entitled to any credit for so doing. They ought to have urged the House of Commons to waive privilege in this case, and they ought to have agreed to this Amendment. If, on the other hand, this is not a question of House of Commons privilege, then the noble Earl ought to be the first to vindicate the privilege of this House as against the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02877"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: The treatment of this Amendment throws a striking light on the methods and mental operations of His Majesty's Government. This Amendment is manifestly a just one. There can be no doubt whatever about its justice, and the noble Earl in charge of the Bill never said for one moment that there was any argument against it, except that of the privilege of the House of Commons. Allow me, without going into the arguments we have just heard, to show what this really means. I ventured to mention it in Committee and I will repeat it. I take the instance of my own county, the county of Northumberland&#x2014;a very large county with a populous urban district in one corner of it and a large and very thinly-populated rural district north of it. Supposing a town-planning scheme is carried out, as is likely, in the thickly-populated district. According to the Bill the ratepayers on Tweedside, forty or fifty miles away, are to pay the rates incident upon that action. It is not only in the case of town planning. It runs through the Bill. That is manifestly unjust. The ratepayer in the rural district will get no benefit whatever. I see the noble Earl opposite turning over the pages. I think he has possibly caught me in a technical error. It might not apply to every part of the Bill. I anticipate that objection, and I say that my main argument is this, that it does throw upon the rural ratepayer expenses by which the urban ratepayer alone benefits. That is a manifest injustice, and the Government answer that not by argument but by the plea of privilege.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02880"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The House of Commons raises that objection, not His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02881"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: We all know that the House of Commons makes the objection. We also know that the House of Commons is not allowed to do anything except what His Majesty's Government think fit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02882"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The assertion of privilege by the other House in a matter of this kind is in no way affected by its being waived. If the noble Duke's arguments in favour of the Amendment are correct, it is quite fair to argue that the Government ought to have been convinced and to have waived privilege. But that would have been no use to the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, for what he objects to is the raising of the question of privilege.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02883"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am not referring to the argument of my noble friend, who is perfectly able to defend himself. My argument is my own, if the noble Earl will kindly listen to it. It is this, that the House of Commons, when a case of great hardship is put before them, instead of giving reasons which they think justify that hardship or why they think that hardship should be inflicted, shelter themselves behind the objection that the privileges of the House of Commons are interfered with. I think I am right in saying that. We are often told in these days that the people of this country are not very tolerant of privileges. That is rather a two-edged argument. I have no doubt that the people of this country will support the privileges of the House of Commons as long as they find those privileges asserted in defence of the interests of the people; but if they find, as the Government are teaching them now, that from an overweening desire to preserve and enlarge as far as possible those privileges the real benefit of the country is sacrificed, and injustice such as I submit is imposed by this clause is put upon the ratepayers of the country, I venture to say that the people will not have much respect even for the privileges of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02884"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: In view of what has been said from the Government Bench, I would point out that in moving that these Amendments be disagreed to Mr. Burns said in the other House&#x2014;
<quote>"This is not the time for waiving our privilege,"</quote>
and upon that this Amendment was passed over without any discussion. The passing over of this Amendment in that way will have a very bad effect on the working of the Bill, because this clause provides that where the council of a county are of opinion that for any reason it is expedient that the council should exercise, as respects any rural district in the county, any of the powers of a local authority under Part III of the principal Act, the council, after giving notice to the council of the district of their intention to do so, may apply to the Local Government Board for an order conferring such powers on them. But if the county council are of opinion that it would not be fair to charge the cost as a rate upon the whole county they are perfectly certain, as the provision stands, not to take any action under the clause at all. No county council would consent to spread over the whole county a rate for work carried out in one corner of the county. Therefore the result of the action of the House of Commons in deliberately making use of the plea of privilege for not considering this Amendment will have a very bad effect on their own Bill, and prevent the county council stepping in in many cases where it is desirable that they should do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-02885"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: In the opinion of His Majesty's Government there is a good deal to be said against the Amendment on principle. I endeavoured to explain those objections when the House was in Committee. Clause 13 contemplates that a county council may exercise in a rural district the powers of a local authority under Part III of the principal Act without there being any default on the part of the district council. In such a case it would not seem right that the county council should be able to embark upon an expensive scheme at the cost of a rural district or parish in the county. Lord Belper may very fairly say that in the converse case it would be hard on the county council. His Majesty's Government have tried to meet that case in Clause 10, subsection (1) (<i>a</i>). In cases when there is a default on the part of the rural district council the county council
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0353"/>
<col>693</col>
can complain to the Board, and in those cases the expenses would be borne by the rural district or such part as was affected. I think noble Lords will see that there is a point of substance in the objection to this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02896"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I move that your Lordships agree with the Commons in the said Amendment. The Amendment originally proposed by your Lordships' House deals with two points. The first is the question of injury wilfully done by the tenant. That is the part which in another place has been struck out. Perhaps I might point out that this clause only applies to future contracts, and that in those future contracts the landlord will be able to protect himself by inserting a clause
<col>694</col>
to determine the tenancy at once or in seven days if notice under the clause has been given by the local authority showing that the house has become insanitary under these circumstances. Noble Lords have urged that it takes a long time to eject these persons, but an individual who has a considerable number of these properties assures me that he has not found it necessary to invoke the assistance of the law in a single case in fifteen years experience; he has always got the tenant out within fourteen days. It is quite true that when resort has to be made to the Court and the rent is 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week or less the period of ejectment is five weeks, but, as a matter of practice, although that may be the law, the period is not nearly so long as is there provided for. In those circumstances I hope that noble Lords opposite will consider that the landlord is sufficiently protected. After all, a great many of these houses are held under short agreements, and it will be perfectly easy for a landlord to turn out a tenant of this kind in a very short period. The clause will apply largely to the very worse kind of property that exists in the slums of our great towns, and it is very important where the tenant is found of an undesirable kind really doing damage he should be turned out at once.</membercontribution></p>

Here is a proposal under which it is expressly laid down that the tenant may be in fault but the landlord is to bear responsibility. That is manifestly unjust. Your Lordships altered that; it went back to another place, and there the representative of the Government said "If the landlord does not like to be made responsible for another man's sins he can turn the tenant out." It was pointed out to the Government that that was a difficult process. One would have thought that the Government would have grasped at the opportunity of enabling the procedure to be more rapidly carried into effect, and of making it as easy as they could for the landlord to turn out such a tenant, but they would not look at the Amendment. The truth is that the Government were afraid to insert such an

Amendment; they were afraid of their friends in the House of Commons; and I do not think they present a particularly dignified appearance when they ask your Lordships not to insist on this Amendment for those reasons.</membercontribution></p>

I shall propose in lieu therefore certain Amendments on the Paper; and there is also a further consequential Amendment which is in the charge of my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland. Perhaps it is only right that I should explain the reasons why His Majesty's Government were unable to meet the wishes of noble Lords opposite. It did not seem to them, as the House has already heard from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, that the County Court was a suitable authority to deal with matters of the kind involved. Having once reached that conclusion the question was whether any alternative was possible. The Government considered whether there was in existence some tribunal which would meet the case, but there were so many objections against the other tribunals suggested as alternatives that the Government were unable to agree to them. In the circumstances they propose two Amendments which I hope will go some way towards meeting the wishes of noble Lords opposite. The Government have accepted in another place an appeal on points of law from the Local Government Board to the High Court; and, in the second place, we propose to insert words in Clause 40 to the effect that under the clause all inquiries should be public. Your Lordships will see that I have given notice of an Amendment to that effect. Perhaps it would be convenient that I should point out now that as we insert words in Clause 40 providing that the Board shall not dismiss any appeal without having previously held a public inquiry, the provision in Clause 17, subsection (7), which requires the Board to hold a public inquiry in the
<col>696</col>
case of a closing order becomes unnecessary, because under Clause 40 every inquiry held by the Local Government Board becomes a public inquiry. The President of the Local Government Board also wishes the statement to be made that instructions shall be given to inspectors to hear, at any inquiry or appeal to which Clause 40 applies, all parties interested who claim to be heard; to visit the premises and invite the parties to accompany them; and to submit a full and impartial report to the Board of the evidence given and the result of their own inspection. The inspector will be empowered to take evidence on oath, and will be instructed to do so if circumstances make it desirable. These instructions will be published; and I hope this assurance on the part of my right hon. friend will meet, at any rate to some degree, the objections of noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-02906"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I cannot help calling attention to the comic situation in which the Government are placed. Here is a Government looking about for a tribunal to which aggrieved persons who are ordered by a Government Department to do something which they think they ought not to be ordered to do may appeal, but they cannot think of any tribunal except the Local Government Board itself. Are we really to believe that statesmanship has fallen so low? Are we really to believe that with all the talent which the Government have at their disposal it is impossible to find a tribunal to which to appeal? The truth of the matter is that His Majesty's Government are determined to create a powerful bureaucracy which will change the legislation of this country. This will mean that henceforth we are not to have an appeal to law or to impartial tribunals, but that we are to be entirely at the mercy of Government Offices. They have to a very great extent succeeded in their desire, and they say that what they have done they have done on the plea of economy. I venture to think that the sacrifice of liberty for the sake of economy is very bad statesmanship, and I do not know whether I shall receive the condemnation of noble Lords opposite if I say that I would rather that the procedure of this country was just than that it was cheap, although, of course,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0355"/>
<col>697</col>
I quite admit that cheapness is a very great object. Then, my Lords, the final comedy is found in what the noble Earl has just told us are the intentions of the Local Government Board. First of all, allow me to say that I believe entirely in the good faith of the President of the Local Government Board and his full intentions with regard to these regulations, and I have no doubt that he will carry out both in the letter and in the spirit all of them. But may I remind the noble Earl that the President of the Local Government Board is not there for ever, and that he cannot bind his successors? The final comedy is arrived at when we are actually assured that the inquiry shall be an impartial one. Was there ever a Government who thought it necessary to come down to this House and to assure the House, when rejecting so many of our Amendments, that there should be an impartial inquiry as if it was a great gift that they were giving us or a great concession that they were promising?</membercontribution></p>

The noble Duke opposite will remember that this was an Amendment which he proposed to deal with cases of collieries with which were let a number of houses. He thought, and quite rightly thought, that it was not desirable that the over landlord should be required to step in and look after those cottages, and the question was how such a thing was to be prevented. I did my best to assure your Lordships that that was provided for in the Bill, but the noble Duke was not satisfied with that assurance and moved an Amendment to the effect that the words "to a tenant for habitation" should be inserted, and then at the last moment he went further and proposed that we should also put in the words "his own." I was quite willing, if the Amendment was insisted upon, to agree to the words "to a tenant for habitation," and said so at once, although we thought it was quite unnecessary; but in consequence of the further Amendment of the noble Duke to insert the words "his own," when the Bill as amended went down to another place it was agreed, I think by people on both sides of the House, that the Amendment as amended would allow evasion of the clause, and that was really very undesirable. In these circumstances I hope that your Lordships will not insist on the Amendment.

The view of His Majesty's Government was that the whole matter was surrounded with a great deal of difficulty, and that under the circumstances to put down "one-half" was to make one of those compromises which are so dear to the hearts of our countrymen, and one that we hoped would prove acceptable to your Lordships' House. It gives, on the one hand, half the profit to the local authority and the other half to the individual concerned. I do not pretend to put it forward to your Lordships as a proposition which is in the abstract perfect. There is a good deal in this Bill which in the abstract is not perfect, owing to the fact that we have had to make so many concessions to noble Lords opposite. Naturally, His Majesty's Government would have preferred the Bill as it was originally introduced, but in view of the objection taken by noble Lords opposite we have inserted this with some hope that it will not prove entirely unacceptable.</membercontribution></p>

He says that the Government would have preferred the original form of the Bill. All I can say is they have concealed that preference until this moment, because they have never uttered one word in defence of the original form in which the Bill reached your Lordships' House in this respect. I should have thought, therefore, that the suggestion of the noble Earl was quite indefensible, but apparently he has had concealed in his breast a love for the proposal which he preferred to keep out of sight. However, your Lordships now know that His Majesty's Government would have preferred that the whole of the profits arising from these improvements should have gone to the local authority. I hope the noble Earl will pardon me when I say that I cannot take this observation of his quite seriously&#x2014;he knows I always treat him with the greatest respect&#x2014;and that in my opinion His Majesty's Government have adopted this one-half compromise on the principle of any port in a storm, and on no

other. They have not been able to defend the fraction of one-half which they have arrived at, nor have they been able to explain to your Lordships' House what it is a half of. The result of this is only to illustrate further what I ventured to put to your Lordships at an earlier period of this afternoon's proceedings, that there can be no finality about this Bill, and that this particular proposal for settling the betterment question can only be taken to be a provisional arrangement. If it turns out by good luck to work well perhaps it will remain, but I do not think that His Majesty's Government will be able to take any credit for it if it does work well.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03167"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: With your Lordships' permission, I desire to say a word with regard to this. I think that this particular Amendment was moved by the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury. I wish to say, on behalf of the President of the Local Government Board, that he has given every consideration to the point which is dealt with in the Amendment. I think it has not been realised that all the provisions contained in a town-planning scheme with reference to the limitations of buildings, and so on, are not necessarily to be regarded as affecting properties injuriously with regard to compensation. The point will be made clearer by an example. A local authority might in their scheme propose that on a particular area not more than a certain number of houses should be erected. The Board might agree with the proposal as being in the best interests of the amenity of the district, but might consider that the limit was not reasonable so far as it prevented the payment of compensation, and they would then insert a higher limit which would be reasonable. The lower limit would stand as to the number of buildings to be erected on the area, but in considering the question of compensation the higher limit would be taken as reasonable for the area, and as between the two limits the owner would become entitled to compensation. If the owner disagreed with the Board as to what was reasonable, he would no doubt object to the scheme, and, if so, he has his remedy under the proposal which has been agreed to by noble Lords opposite, as the scheme would have to lie on the Table of both Houses of Parliament for thirty days.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03169"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: What really emerges from the observations of the noble Earl is that the Government realise that the subsection as it stands goes
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0363"/>
<col>713</col>
beyond what ought fairly to be enacted, but they shrink from putting any Amendment in to cover the point&#x2014;I do not quite know why. They have, therefore, adopted the expedient of leaving the words as they stand, and explaining them in such a way as to remove part of the harshness of their import. I do not admire that method of legislation. It is bad enough to have an obscure clause, but it is worse to have an obscure clause which is the subject of a further obscure explanation. If the noble Earl tries to explain away the plain meaning of the words of a clause, naturally enough the form that explanation takes cannot be a very clear one. Apparently there is to be one standard of reasonableness from the point of view of the local authority and another standard of reasonableness from the point of view of the landowner in regard to these conditions of amenity, but what would be perfectly reasonable to impose from the point of view of the local authority might be very unreasonable from the point of view of the landowner to accept. I understand that the Local Government Board wish to assure us that if it is unreasonable from the point of view of the landowner they will see that the question of compensation is left open, and if the clause is worked on that principle no doubt that will be a considerable modification of its effect. I hope that in the instructions which no doubt the Government will issue upon this subject they will make the meaning of the clause, according to their interpretation, clear to those who have to interpret it, because I am afraid, however clever those gentlemen may be, they will not arrive at that conclusion unless the Government explain how the clause ought to be read.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03218"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: I wish to call attention to Clause 68, because it is one of the important clauses that the County Councils Association were very anxious to have dealt with. The alternative subsection will to a certain extent make the clause perhaps a little better than in the form in which it originally stood, but I am bound to say it does not touch the point which we wish to press on the Local Government Board. The form in which they have put the clause is, we consider, really a direct attack on local government, because it is not in conformity with the system of local government that any authority should prescribe duties for, or have direct control over, a person who is appointed and paid solely by the county council. I am very much surprised that the Local Government Board should not have consented to deal with the county councils in the way that
<col>716</col>
every other Government Department deals with them, and to communicate their wishes and their views with regard to any important measure which they have under their control direct to the county council, either by memorandum or circular or letter, as is done by all the other important Departments, including the Home Office, the Board of Education, and the Board of Agriculture. I am quite aware that, under present circumstances, with the number of members now in the House, and after what has been said from our own Front Bench, it is impossible for me to press this matter. I will say that I think the additional subsection which it is proposed to move is a considerable alleviation of the position, because at all events it ensures, whatever the duties prescribed by the Local Government Board, that we shall have an opportunity in Parliament of considering them. The order prescribing these duties will have to be laid before Parliament, and therefore we are assured that at all events there will be nothing contained in the prescription of those duties which the Local Government Board have not a just right to prescribe and put upon the county council. I have not the least fear that the present President of the Local Government Board would be inclined to do anything of that sort, but, as has been said before, you have to guard against the future as well as against the present, and it is very desirable that we should have some certainty with regard to the regulations which are to be imposed. Let me only suggest one very small Amendment to the subsection (8) which it is now proposed to add. These papers were issued yesterday, and therefore I have only seen the terms of this new subsection for a very short time, but it does seem to me that what I am about to suggest would meet the point I have raised, that the communications of the Local Government Board should be direct with the county councils and not with one of their officers. I think it would in that way be more in conformity with local government. The words are, "An order under this section prescribing the duties of medical officers of health of a county." I think the words "by the Local Government Board" ought to be inserted after the word "order," because this refers to the duties prescribed by the Local Government Board and not the duties laid down by the county council. However, that is a matter of drafting. The words I wish to have inserted after

"shall be" are "communicated direct to the county council" and then go on "and shall also be laid before Parliament." It is more a technical point than anything else, but it will at all events go some way to relieve the feeling of county councils with regard to the present form of this Amendment, because it will give them an assurance, which we should be only too glad to have, from the Local Government Board that they will always communicate with us direct and do what they can to assist us in carrying out our duties. We shall be only too happy to co-operate with them in taking care that any arrangements they make with regard to the important matters with which they have to deal shall be carried out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03219"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: His Majesty's Government would have no objection to accepting part of the Amendment suggested by the noble Lord. We should be glad to insert the words "shall be communicated to the county council and shall be." I am not quite sure what the meaning of the word "direct" is. I do not think that the Local Government Board generally corresponds with the county councils except directly, and as it is very desirable, especially at this stage of the Bill, not to introduce words about which there could be any doubt in the future, I hope that will satisfy the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03220"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: I am quite satisfied with that, on the understanding that communications should be between the Local Government Board and the county councils through their clerks. I think that it ought to be "county councils," in the plural, because these are general orders. I move that those words be inserted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03223">On Question, That the Lords agree with the Commons in the said Amendments&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03224"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: I cannot allow the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to put the Amendment to Clause 69 at this stage without making the strongest possible protest. There is included here an Amendment to Clause 69, which is in no sense consequential on the Amendment to Clause 68, and the only reason why it is included here is that it is said to be a consequential Amendment on the omission of subsection
<col>718</col>
(2) of Clause 68. That subsection provided that the Local Government Board might prescribe the duties of medical officers of health. When that Amendment went back to the Commons, the Commons accepted our Amendment but put in other words which made the clause wider, because they stated&#x2014;
<quote>"The duties of a medical officer of health of a county shall be such general duties as may be prescribed by order of the Local Government Board and such other duties as may be assigned to him by the county council."</quote>
The subsection in Clause 69 which it is now proposed to amend is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The medical officer of health of a district shall give to the medical officer of health of the county any information which it is in his power to give, and which the medical officer of health of the county may reasonably require from him for the purpose of his duties."</quote>
We entirely agree with that clause in every way. It is absolutely necessary that the minor medical officer should give to the medical officer of the county such information as he can with regard to matters in the county, because the medical officer of the county has the control, not only of matters under this Bill, but he is responsible to a large extent for the pollution of rivers, and so on, and must be communicated with in regard to sanitation schemes. It is proposed, with regard to the medical officer of the district giving information to the medical officer of health of the county, that his duties should be limited by the addition of the words "general duties prescribed by the Local Government Board," so that the medical officer of health of a district is only to assist and give information to the medical officer of health for the county with regard to matters which are prescribed by the Local Government Board. So far from it being a consequential Amendment it is exactly the opposite, and I hope that the Government will consent to leave the Clause as it stood originally, which was perfectly clear, and no objection was taken to it in this House. Therefore, as far as I can see, there is no ground for altering it in any way whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03225"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid, in view of the fact that the Local Government Board are not able to meet the washes of the noble Lord, that he will hardly find my answer satisfactory. The point is that the Amendment to Clause 69, line 36, is consequential on an Amendment to Clause 68, subsection (2), which enables the county council to impose
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0366"/>
<col>719</col>
duties on the county medical officer in addition to those prescribed under that subsection by the Board. That, I think, was a subsection which was put in in the hope of meeting the wishes of those noble Lords who were interested in the views of the County Councils Association, and I think, from what fell from the noble Lord earlier in the course of the proceedings, he is satisfied so far as that provision goes. Then, in the opinion of the Local Government Board, it would not be right that the medical officer of health for the district should be required to furnish information to the county medical officer on any matter which the county council might choose to assign as a duty to their medical officer. It is perfectly true that the limitation which the noble Lord has spoken of has been inserted regarding the medical officer of health for the district being required to give information to the county medical officer of health; but if the noble Lord will be good enough to look at line 33, on page 33 of the Bill, he will see there that the medical officer of health for the district must give to the county medical officer any information which it is in his power to give. Under these circumstances I am not without hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied with the concession which we have tried to make. The Board have received representations from district councils in favour of some such Amendment as that which has been inserted, and therefore as it is also an attempt, however unsuccessful, to try and meet the wishes of the noble Lord himself, I hope that he will withdraw his objection and allow the Amendments to go in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03226"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: I certainly will if the noble Earl will make the Amendment in conformity with his explanation. I understand he says that by the first part of the clause the district officer has to give any information which it is in his power to give; and if he will put in, instead of the word "and," the words "as well as those" which the medical officer of health of the county may reasonably require from him, it would carry it out.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03256"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: On this Motion I should like to put a question to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack if he will allow me to do so. I am not trying to lay a trap for him even if I were capable of succeeding in any such attempt. The noble Lord told us just now, when we complained that the power of appeal to the Law Courts was taken away from us in the Bill, that on points of law that right was preserved to us. I should like to ask the noble and learned Lord how the words which it is proposed to re-insert here agree with that statement, because these words say "The confirmation by the Board shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act have been complied with, and that the order has been duly made and is within the powers of this Act." Whether it is within the powers of the Act or not is surely a legal question, and that is put entirely at the disposal of the Local Government Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03257"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: As I understand it, the First Schedule relates
<col>722</col>
to the compulsory acquisition of land by a local authority, and says this&#x2014;
<quote>"Where a local authority propose to purchase land compulsorily under this Act, the local authority may submit to the Board an order putting in force as respects the land specified in the order the provisions of the Lands Clauses Acts"&#x2014;</quote>
that is the Act of 1845 which has been worked on ever since, and under which an arbitrator without the smallest supervision, except on matters of law, decides the value. Then it says&#x2014;
<quote>"An order made under this schedule shall be of no force unless and until it is confirmed by the Board, and the Board may confirm the order either without modification or subject to such modifications as they think fit, and an order when so confirmed shall become final and have effect as if enacted in this Act; and the confirmation by the Board shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act have been complied with, and that the order has been duly made and is within the powers of this Act."</quote>
The effect is to make an order under the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, final and conclusive. It is the order of the Board that is made final and conclusive that the requirements of the Act have been complied with&#x2014;that is to say, that the formalities have been complied with. Speaking from memory, my recollection is that that is the procedure under the Small Holdings Act. I hope I shall be excused from vouching that I am right, because really it is almost impossible to give an opinion on a point of law of this kind without having had notice of the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03258"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may be allowed to apologise to the noble and learned Lord for not having given him notice, but my question arose out of a remark which fell from the noble Lord in the course of this debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03259"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry the noble and learned Lord has not had notice of the question. All I can say is that in the observations which I addressed to your Lordships this morning&#x2014;I am afraid at much too great length&#x2014;this was one of the matters to which I referred. It seems to me it is another example of the extraordinary indifference displayed by the Government to the authority of the Courts of Law, to the absence of any jurisdiction of a Court of Law where a person thought himself aggrieved, for these drastic words appear in the Schedule that the confirmation of the Local Government Board is to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0368"/>
<col>723</col>
have the force of an Act of Parliament and to be unquestionable as to its validity by any Court in the realm. It ill becomes me to bandy words with the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack on points of law, and I would not venture to do so for a single moment if it was not quite evident that the point had been brought before him at a moment's notice. This is one of the matters that has been most carefully considered and canvassed throughout these debates, and yet it is only now, on the consideration of the Commons Amendments to the Lords Amendments that for the first time the attention of the highest legal authority in the country, the Lord Chancellor, has been called to one of the most drastic changes introduced by this Bill. So that, my Lords, it appears to be the procedure of this Cabinet not to consult the Lord Chancellor on an important point of law of this kind. I have long suspected that the highest legal authority in the country has had no hand in the drafting of this Bill, and the noble and learned Lord hears now for the first time that when an order is confirmed under the Schedule by the Local Government Board&#x2014;an administrative Department administered by a Parliamentary chief&#x2014;no Court in the realm would be able to question it. The High Court cannot question it, the Court of Appeal cannot question it, and your Lordships' House sitting in a judicial capacity cannot question it. Whatever the Local Government Board chooses to decree is the law; once they have confirmed the order, no one can question it. The noble and learned Lord says this is under the Lands Clauses Act. It might as well be under an Act containing only one word, "Abracadabra," and leave it to any one to interpret it. I earnestly hope at this last stage of the Bill that the country will realise how it is being governed, and what the kind of procedure must be that is adopted by the Government when such a clause can pass into a Bill without the Lord Chancellor being aware of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03260"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess has completely misconceived every thing I said on this point. When I spoke before, I referred to what had been dealt with on page 10&#x2014;namely, that the Local Government Board might at any stage of the proceedings on appeal state a special case, and so anybody is entitled to go to a Court of Law. Now, as regards this particular clause, let me say, in the first place, that when I said I had not heard of this
<col>724</col>
point before, I naturally referred to the point before the House to which the noble Duke drew attention. That was the point that was new to me, and however much I should like to answer the noble Duke, it is quite impossible, without the Statutes before me and without more than one minute's consideration, to give a definite answer in law, and I should be doing wrong, with the responsibility I have, if I did more than try to indicate what the point was. The noble Marquess suggests that I have in some way admitted that the Cabinet proceeds without consulting me, and that I am disregarded and not consulted on these matters. My Lords, if that was true I would not remain in such a Cabinet for twenty-four hours. As a matter of fact, everything in this Bill was put before me and before my colleagues, and we had the fullest opportunity of considering it. It never occurred to me that there was any improper or unusual or unconstitutional exclusion of the Courts of Law, and if anything of that kind had existed I should have objected to it. I am only too pleased at any time to answer any question, and I am sure the noble Duke would be the first to admit that I cannot be expected to answer a question of law at a moment's notice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03261"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The Motion before the House is, I think, to reinstate subsection (2) which was in the Schedule of the original Bill. Surely, my Lords, the Government must have considered that subsection when it was in the original Bill, and surely the noble and learned Lord's attention must have been called to this when the Schedule was originally inserted in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03262"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: When we struck it out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03263"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Yes; that is exactly what I wanted to convey. Surely the attention of the Government must have been drawn to subsection (2) because it was struck out, and it was struck out, if I remember rightly, on account of the extremely arbitrary power which it gave to the Local Government Board to decide what the law was. I must confess that it seems to me very doubtful indeed whether, under the circumstances, it ought to be reinserted if we do not really know what the effect of inserting it is.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03348"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the commencement of public business I would, with your Lordships' leave, ask the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, the Question which stands in my name on the Paper. It is as follows: To ask the Secretary of State for India, with reference to the publication in India of official Papers concerning the new Legislative Councils, when he will be in a position to comply with the provision in the Indian Councils Act of the present Session, "That all Regulations and Rules of Business made under the Act shall be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after they are made."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03349"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: It is, I think, natural that the noble Lord should put this Question, because these Regulations will show really
<col>730</col>
what the Indian Councils Act means. They are very voluminous&#x2014;between 300 and 400 pages. The House will understand, therefore, that it would have been impossible, or at least inexpedient, to send those 300 pages over by telegraph. The full distribution will leave Bombay on the 27th inst., arriving here about December 13, and they will be circulated at once. No time has been or will be lost.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03351"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the noble Earl's Question, I may say that a Paper has recently been circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer containing a revised estimate of the yield of the taxation imposed by the Finance Bill after allowance has been made for the effect of the alterations in the Bill and the loss due to delay. The noble Earl will find from this Paper that it is estimated that the yield will be for 1909&#x2013;10&#x2014;Increment Value Duty, &#x00A3;20,000; Undeveloped Land Duty, &#x00A3;140,000; and Mineral Rights Duty, &#x00A3;350,000. This estimate, I would remind the noble Earl, was based on the assumption that the Finance Bill would receive the Royal Assent somewhere about the end of this month. On the same assumption the increased cost of the valuation for the current year, over and above the &#x00A3;50,000 originally provided for in the Budget, is estimated at &#x00A3;200,000.</membercontribution></p>

<col>731</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03356"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE,</member> who had given notice, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move, "That this House is not justified in giving its consent to this Bill until it has been submitted to the judgment of the country," said: My Lords, this debate, which bids fair to be a memorable one, has already produced one incident which I think will attract a good deal of public attention; the noble Earl has not thought fit to offer one word of explanation or recommendation of this important Bill. It is sometimes said that there are occasions when silence is more eloquent than speech. I think this is one of them. We regret the decision of the noble Earl, because we always listen to him with pleasure, and upon this occasion it would have been interesting to us to note the arguments by which he might have enforced his case, and to see whether he was content with the more persuasive and sedative style which he usually affects, or whether he resorted to, shall I say, the more blustering rhetoric of some of his colleagues.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03357">The explanation of the noble Earl's silence is, I think, not far to seek. It is, in effect, an announcement to the House that your Lordships have really no concern with this important measure. I note with interest the cheer from the opposite Benches. The noble Earl, by raising his finger to his hat, has intimated that to us with an emphasis which it would probably have taken some of his colleagues three columns of inflated oratory to arrive at. I am afraid that, much as I should like, for reasons which, I think, will be obvious to the House [The noble Marquess was obviously suffering from a severe cold], to imitate the noble Earl's example, I can scarcely expect to escape quite so easily.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03358">But the case which I have to make is, after all, a very simple one. What we have to say about this Bill is this. It is a grave and I think I should be justified in saying an unprecedented measure. It has never been before the people of this country. It needs the concurrence of the House of Lords. The House of Lords should not, in our opinion, undertake the responsibility of giving that concurrence until it has become aware that the people of this country desire that this Bill should become law. My Lords, that is our position. What is the position
<col>732</col>
of noble Lords opposite? We understand it to be something of this kind. They expect us to pass this Bill <i>nemine contradicente</i>, perhaps after a feeble protest, much as we sometimes pass Departmental Bills on the recommendation of a Lord-in-Waiting towards the end of August. That is not how we understand the position, and in our opinion there is absolutely no authority in support of the contention of His Majesty's Government. I should like to know to what authority the noble Earl will be able to point. Is there any organic law which covers the case? Is there any compact between the two Houses to which any one can refer? Are there any <i>obiter dicta</i> of eminent men which support the theory? I am aware of no such authorities to show that this House is precluded either from discussing or from rejecting the Bill upon the Table. I may be told that such a course is unusual. So it is. But is this a usual Budget? We I have here a constitutional safeguard, and we are not, in our opinion, justified in lightly dispensing with it. If this Bill is to pass into law it must be enacted&#x2014;
<quote>"by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal."</quote>
Is that some mere musty anachronism? I think not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03359">I am not going this evening to attempt any elaboration of the historical arguments, illustrating the long controversy between the two Houses of Parliament as to their respective privileges. Those controversies are necessarily somewhat inconclusive, because, obviously, each House has a right to have its own opinions, and the opinion of one House cannot of itself prevail over the opinion of the other. But I do desire to put this to your Lordships, that if you take the House of Commons claim at its highest you will not find that that claim bars the right of the Lords to reject a Bill of this kind. You are probably familiar with the long struggle that went on during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries between the two Houses. I shall only quote one from the many interesting documents recorded during those years. I find a Commons argument in 1689, which was based upon the assumption that taxes are the sole grant of the Commons. That argument proceeded thus&#x2014;
<quote>"And the Lords are not to alter such gift, grant, limitation, appointment, or modification by the Commons in any part or circumstance, or otherwise
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0373"/>
<col>733</col>
interpose in such Bill than to pass or reject the same for the whole, without any alteration or amendment though in case of the subjects. As the Kings and Queens, by the constitution and laws of Parliament, are to take all or leave all in such gifts, grams, and presents from the Commons, and cannot lake part and leave part, so are the Lords to pass all or reject all without diminution or alteration."</quote>
There you have clearly and distinctly placed on record the right of this House to reject a Bill of this kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03360">I venture to suggest that if that right was necessary in the seventeenth century, it has become indispensable to us to-day. I say that for two reasons. Two practices have lately grown up which seem to me to establish my point. I refer, in the first place, to the tendency to interpret the privilege of the House of Commons with a degree of strictness which, I believe, never obtained to the same extent in former times. We have had examples of that interpretation within the last few days, and I will not further dwell upon that point. But another practice has grown up&#x2014;quite a recent practice&#x2014;I mean the practice of grouping together under one Bill a large number of measures dealing with different taxes. That is a recent practice, and it never assumed its present proportions until the year 1894. In the year 1894 the annual taxing Bill ceased to be a mere Customs and Inland Revenue Bill, and became a kind of omnibus finance measure. And this change was made with the obvious intention of embarrassing your Lordships in the exercise of your undoubted rights. You will observe that the mere fact that this practice was resorted to in itself implies the admission that your Lordships have a right of rejection, because the idea of this practice of "tacking" Bills was that you could make it more difficult for the Lords to reject a Bill which they desired to reject by tacking it on to another Bill which they did not desire to reject. What is the combined effect of these two innovations? The effect of them is this&#x2014;we find ourselves confronted with a kind of hotch-potch of financial legislation, and we are told that while, on the one hand, we are precluded from dealing with each tax upon its merits, on the other we are precluded also from altering a single word or a single line in any one of these measures. Is it not obvious that we are thus driven back upon the only remedy which is open to us&#x2014;I mean the remedy of rejection&#x2014;if in such cases we deem it desirable that that should take place?</p>
<col>734</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03361">In order to show your Lordships that I am not preferring any very unreasonable or unprecedented claim, I venture to quote to your Lordships very short extracts from words used in this House by two noble Lords, each of whom filled with great dignity the position now filled by the noble Earl opposite. In 1894 Lord Spencer, in moving the Finance Bill of that year, used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"We all know that we in this House cannot amend a Money Bill, but we have a perfect right to discuss it, and a full right to throw it out if we so will."</quote>
And Lord Ripon, two years later said, this&#x2014;
<quote>"After all, your Lordships cannot alter the Bill, and as you are not going to object to it, which you could constitutionally do I do not think it makes very much difference upon which stage of the Bill the discussion is taken."</quote>
But this Bill seems to me, if I may say so, to go out of its way in ousting the Lords from their legitimate opportunities of dealing with the subject-matter of the Bill. I may remind your Lordships that in 1907 a Land Valuation Bill dealing with Scotland came before this House, and that your Lordships declined to pass it into law. The following year a similar Bill came before you again. On that occasion you amended it, your Amendments were not accepted, and the Bill was dropped. Now your Lordships will observe that on both of those occasions this question of land valuation was presented to you as a matter with which you were perfectly competent and entitled to deal, and it does seem to me to be a thing unheard of, after that has taken place, that you should now be told that because a measure of precisely the same sort is grafted on to this Finance Bill you are to be deprived of the opportunity which, by common admission, was yours in 1907 and 1908. Again in 1908 your Lordships rejected a Licensing Bill proposed by His Majesty's Government. In the case of the licensing provisions of this Bill you have an equally cynical invasion of your Lordships' rights and privileges. You have included in this Bill another Licensing Bill every bit as crushing in its severity&#x2014;more crushing in its severity&#x2014;than the Bill of 1908 with which you had the right to deal, and you are told that you are precluded from dealing with it because it is bound up in the cover of a Finance Bill. I ask your Lordships, What self-respecting Second Chamber would tolerate such treatment?</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0374"/>
<col>735</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03362">Oliver Cromwell invented a little House of Lords of his own for the express purpose&#x2014;as he put it&#x2014;of protecting the people of England against "an omnipotent House of Commons&#x2014;the horridest arbitrariness that ever existed in the world." I think we detect signs of this horrid arbitrariness in the measure which we are now discussing. In all seriousness, my Lords, we have a right to ask where this kind of thing is going to stop. If you can graft Licensing Bills and Land Valuation Bills and measures of that kind on the Finance Bill, what is to prevent your grafting on it, let us say, a Home Rule Bill&#x2014;setting up an authority in Ireland to collect and dispense all the taxes of that country? There is literally no limit to the abuses which might creep in if such a practice were allowed to go on without restriction. Upon this ground alone I venture to think your Lordships' House might consider very seriously whether you are justified in passing this Bill into law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03363">But there are other matters included in its scope, and upon these I desire to say a few words. I trust, however, I have said enough to show your Lordships that the question before you is not whether you <i>can</i> reject this Bill but whether you <i>ought</i> to reject this Bill&#x2014;a wholly different thing. You have to consider its results as they would affect all classes of the community, and the principles that underlie it, and you have to consider whether the people of this country have been consulted with regard to it. If you find that the results are likely to be disastrous and that the principles underlying it, which we detect not only from the official utterances of members of the Government, but also from the more indiscreet explanations of so-called supporters of the Government, are pernicious and that the whole matter is one that has never been duly referred to the people of this country, then I venture to say that your Lordships have a clear duty before you&#x2014;not to decree the final extinction of the Bill&#x2014;because that is not what we propose, but to insist that before it becomes law an authoritative expression of the opinion of the electors of the United Kingdom shall have reached us with regard to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03364">Let us look for a moment at the group of Bills included in this measure. Is this an ordinary Budget? His Majesty's Ministers have never ceased explaining
<col>736</col>
that it is anything but an ordinary Budget. Take the language of the Prime Minister a few weeks ago in the City. He spoke of the Budget as having "far-reaching political and social results"&#x2014;political and social, mind you, not financial. The President of the Board of Trade describes it as containing "a new idea, pregnant, formidable, full of life"&#x2014;" a tremendous question never put to the country." The Lord Advocate said of it that it was "designed to inaugurate a new era." The Chancellor of the Exchequer the other day, comparing it with other financial measures, said: "Here I confess there is a larger number of new and novel methods of raising taxation than have been incorporated in any single Bill within the last forty-eight or fifty years." After such an exegesis as that it is idle to talk of the Bill as being an ordinary Budget Bill, to which the ordinary treatment of the annual Budget Bill would of necessity apply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03365">Now, my Lords, I will not attempt to pass in review at any length the different portions of the measure, that task no doubt will be adequately performed by noble Lords who will take part in the debate, but I will just notice very briefly one or two of them. In the first place there is the Income Tax. Well, the Income Tax payer is the milch cow of British finance, and as His Majesty's Government have got us into a financial scrape no doubt Income Tax payers are prepared to help them to get the country out of it. But we are, I think, justified in calling to mind that not very long ago the present Prime Minister, speaking of a uniform tax of 1s. in the pound, told his hearers that in his view such a rate was impossible to justify in time of peace, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is a burden on the trade of the country which in the long run affects not only profits, but wages. It tends to destroy, or at any rate, contract a most readily available reserve on which the State can draw in sudden unforeseen emergency."</quote>
Now here you have, in time of peace, an Income Tax running up, in some cases, to 1<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in the pound, and naturally you ask yourselves, "What becomes of the detriment to wages? What becomes of the security of this reserve on which Chancellors of the Exchequer so properly rely to provide means for great emergencies?" Income Tax payers would, however, I believe gladly bear their share of the new burden, and there would
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0375"/>
<col>737</col>
possibly be very much less said about this particular tax were it not for the fact that this Bill deals with another group of taxes which would fall with tremendous severity on the same people who are already expected to pay this very high rate of Income Tax.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03366">I refer, of course, to the Death Duties. Of the Death Duties I think it may be said without contradiction that there is no tax more naturally odious to those who have to pay it. It is odious, because it is capricious and uncertain in its operation. You may have an estate which will go harmless for half a century while upon another estate a succession of levies may fall one after the other in such a manner as literally to eviscerate the estate. Another consideration is this: this tax falls on the victims in circumstances of peculiar hardship. The head of the family is gone; he may have been the bread-winner of the family; his widow and children, or his relations, have to be provided for, and in addition to the numerous calls which the heir has to meet, the Exchequer comes down on him with these tremendous claims. So long as those Death Duties can be kept within anything like a reasonable compass there is no doubt a great deal to be said for them. I daresay the noble Earl remembers a very interesting Report of a Treasury Committee on the question of a graduated Income Tax. I find attached to that Report an admirable Memorandum written by Sir Henry Primrose in which he says in regard to the Death Duties&#x2014;
<quote>"The owner will treat them as a recurring charge to be met by prudent arrangement without breaking up the home or shattering the family fortune."</quote>
Now, Sir H. Primrose's authority is a very high one, and his views were I believe in the main shared by the Committee; but the point surely of Sir H. Primrose's observation is this, that you have to regard these Death Duties really in the light of a capitalised Income Tax. It is quite easy to state them in terms of Income Tax, and we all know that they do in fact involve, if so stated, a formidable addition to the Income Tax. You are increasing now both the Income Tax and the Death Duties, and you are raising them to a prodigious level. It is said that the Death Duties after all have not been a very formidable burden, and that they have been met with comparative ease. I very much doubt whether that is really
<col>738</col>
the case. It is quite possible that there are colossal fortunes which can stand almost any amount of taxation&#x2014;for a time at any rate. But you have to think not only of colossal fortunes. Of the estates which were dealt with by Somerset House last year, I am told that more than one-half were fortunes of between 5,000<i>l</i>. and 25,000<i>l</i>. Those are not the fortunes of very wealthy people, and they are precisely the fortunes that can ill-bear these additions to their tax liabilities. One thing I think is absolutely established, and that is that these Death Duties really constitute a charge upon the capital and not upon the income of those who pay them. That is the view I believe of the majority of the bankers of this country who issued a circular upon the subject not very long ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03367">I notice that the Secretary of State for War announced the other day that, in his view, emphatically, these are duties upon capital, and properly duties upon capital. These new and enhanced Death Duties seem to me to leave very far behind the point insisted upon by Sir Henry Primrose&#x2014;the point at which the duties are payable without breaking up the home or shattering the family fortunes. And I have no doubt whatever that after the tax gatherer, who has only up to the present time in the case of most estates made one round for the collection of these duties, has been round a second and a third time to the same estates and the same families you will find that that process of breaking up the home and shattering the family fortune which Sir Henry Primrose deprecated so strongly has not only begun, but is proceeding apace. I feel that in addressing this argument to His Majesty's Government I am appealing to a quarter where I shall encounter very little sympathy. The theory which finds favour with the present Government is, as I understand it, one altogether destructive of the family life and family tradition. I see a look of surprise upon the face of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley. But is he familiar with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's oft-cited dictum that in the case of a succession the new owner gets something to which he is not legally entitled, and which is an absolute gift to him whether it comes from a relative or from a stranger? That to many of us is a new and somewhat startling doctrine. And it sounds a little startling, not only
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0376"/>
<col>739</col>
to us, but to people in other countries who have happened upon this <i>obiter dictum</i> of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's. My attention was called the other day to a very interesting paper by a well-known French writer, M. Leroy-Beaulieu, upon the subject of our Finance Bill. This is what he says with regard to the theory that the heir gets something to which he is not entitled. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"This is a reversion to the theory which prevails in Musulman countries, where the Sovereign is the sole proprietor of all property, and private individuals have to be grateful to him for any portion of that property which he permits them, not to own, but to enjoy, without any permanent enjoyment, or the right to transmit it to their heirs."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03368">I pass for a moment to those clauses of the Bill which deal with the question of licensing. It is on record that when this House threw out the Licensing Bill last year the hearts of Ministers were filled with rage. That is a statement made by one of the Ministers themselves, and we certainly detect in the clauses of this measure some survival of that ebullition of wrath. These taxes have been described as moderate, and as intended solely for the purpose of raising revenue. I have great doubts as to their moderation, and I have great doubts as to their appropriateness from the revenue point of view. They are taxes imposed upon an industry which already yields one-third of the total tax income of this country; and it is a revenue which for some time past has shown unmistakable indications of drying up. The Liquor Duties at this moment even on the higher scale yield less, I believe, than they did ten years ago on the lower scale. Let me, in particular, call attention to the case of the on-licence-holders under this Bill. The on-licence-holders are to be subjected to taxation which, in many cases, will impose upon them a burden higher than the monopoly value which the State was to have taken under the Government Bill of last year after a respite of fourteen or twenty-one years. And it is notorious that the effect will be to squeeze out of existence a number of the weaker of these on-licence-holders. Let it be remembered, too, that these are men who, under your existing legislation, have been paying for some time past contributions to a compensation fund instituted under the Act of 1904, so that these poor people have actually been as it were paying insurance premiums, and now find that you are going to forfeit the policy which they had taken out. That is not an unfair
<col>740</col>
description of the case. The brewers will be subject to a charge which in the case of some of the larger breweries will absorb the whole of the profits available for the purpose of meeting the ordinary dividends and, I believe, in some cases the preference dividends also. The hotels&#x2014;harmless institutions&#x2014;are to find themselves suddenly called upon for new and large benevolences.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03369">Then there is the Spirit Duty, which differentiates unfairly between certain parts of the United Kingdom&#x2014;Scotland, Ireland, and the rest. You have so completely overshot the mark in the case of these duties, that a Spirit Duty upon which you counted to bring in &#x00A3;1,600,000, is, according to the revised estimate, only going to bring you in &#x00A3;800,000. Moreover, I am assured that that sum will also prove to be a very considerable over-estimate. I know noble Lords opposite will rejoice greatly and say, "What a splendid thing this is. This means that we are doing something for the sake of temperance. We aimed at Finance and we struck Temperance instead." I believe it to be bad temperance legislation. I believe it to be bad financial legislation. I believe these taxes are well conceived for one purpose only, and that is the purpose of paying off old scores against what is commonly spoken of as "the trade," and depriving this House of its legitimate right of dealing with the whole question of licensing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03370">I pass now briefly to the question of Land Taxes and land valuation, and I am obliged to speak with bated breath upon this subject, because I shall be told that this House, comprising as it does a large number of landowners, should be extremely careful how it criticises proposals which are supposed specially to affect our own pockets. I should be inclined to reply, in the first place, that this is not by any means a House composed entirely of landowners; in the next place, that, if it does contain some landowners, they are probably some of the most competent landowners in the country and, in the third place, that we have acquired a considerable experience of dealing with questions connected with the land&#x2014;an experience for which we have in the past sometimes had to pay somewhat dearly. I believe that no part of your financial scheme is more economically unsound than the portion which includes the Land Taxes. You have singled out for specially severe
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0377"/>
<col>741</col>
financial treatment a form of wealth which is derived from an enterprise in which the profits are small and uncertain&#x2014;an enterprise which is only just recovering from a very serious crisis, an enterprise which fills relatively a much smaller place in the wealth of the country than it did forty or fifty years ago. It is, moreover, an enterprise which, as we now know, and as His Majesty's Ministers frankly admit, has for years past been paying, in consequence of the manner in which it has been assessed for Income Tax, a great deal more into the Exchequer than it could reasonably have been expected to pay. So that "these rapacious landowners." who have monopolised so much power in the political system of this country, have, after all, really been themselves the sufferers and victims rather than the occasion of suffering or illusage to others.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03371">My Lords, we ask, and I think we are entitled to ask, what discredit, in your opinion, attaches to the ownership of land that you should single us out for treatment of this kind. Of two men, one of whom has invested his fortune in land and the other in securities&#x2014;which is, upon the whole, the more harmless and more useful citizen? May we not claim that the man who is content with a modest return, who submits to all the obligations which attach to the ownership of land, who contributes to the rates of his neighbourhood, who bears his part in local affairs, is at least as fully en-titled to just and equitable treatment as his neighbour, who has invested his fortune in, let us say, American shares and spends an agreeable and irresponsible existence at watering places or wherever he chooses to go? Yet, my Lords, the one escapes and the other suffers, and in order that the latter may be sufficiently harassed you are going to set up the colossal edifice of valuation which forms a conspicuous feature of the Bill upon the Table. It is, according to your own showing, to cost the public a couple of millions at the outset. Those who are authorities on the subject greatly doubt whether your couple of millions are in any way nearly sufficient. Besides that you have to consider the expense to which you will put the owners of land, who will naturally have to watch the case on their own behalf. These clauses seem to me to open out an interminable vista of litigation which will worry and unsettle the whole face of the country. It is the more preposterous because the result of all these taxes will not
<col>742</col>
be to make any appreciable addition to the sums available for your immediate necessities. Yet you call these grants in aid and supplies to His Majesty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03372">My Lords, I will ask whether you have really considered the immense difficulty of this system of valuation which you are going to set up. A member of the Government said that it was to be a costly, elaborate, and expensive system of valuation. There are, I am told, about 1,000,000 owners of land in this country, and there are thousands and thousands of persons who hold under leases with more than fifty years to run. All of these are cases that will have to be gone into thoroughly if this business is to be properly carried through. Have you considered the utter unreliability of these wholesale valuations? Why, whenever we read of, let us say, a compensation case in which a railway or any other company is concerned, what is the first thing to strike you? The most eminent members of the profession are brought forward, and their estimates of value are as wide as the Poles asunder. You are not going to have the most eminent members of the profession&#x2014;you are advertising, I am told, for young men at &#x00A3;500 a year, and these are the Daniels come to judgment who are going to solve these insoluble conundrums&#x0021; These valuations based on hypothesis are, of course, sometimes inevitable&#x2014;you cannot help it&#x2014;but it is to my mind rank folly to multiply them as you do under this Bill needlessly and on the kind of scale which is followed here.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03373">I know, of course, that these valuations are to be the groundwork of your new taxes, on which I shall say something presently, but that is not the only purpose which they are to serve. Again I am obliged to quote the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chancellor of the Exchequer offers such a wide field of criticism, not only in his Parliamentary statements, but in his speeches out of doors and in his contributions to the Press that it is very difficult to keep away from him. Mr. Lloyd-George has announced in a letter to the papers that this new valuation is to be the basis on which municipalities ought to buy land which is essential to the development of their towns and on which the State will also buy up land necessary to the policy of recreating rural life in Great Britain. My Lords, that. I confess does seem to me to open a most disconcerting prospect. Are we going to have the State engaged in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0378"/>
<col>743</col>
wholesale land-jobbing transactions with the object of recreating rural life in Great Britain? What recreating rural life in Great Britain means for the life of me I am unable to comprehend, but the prospect is most alarming to my mind. With regard to the Land Taxes, I will notice very briefly one or two salient points that strike one at first sight. In the first place I would venture to say that the greatest merit which legislation can have is that it should be simple and easily intelligible and that if you judge this legislation by that standard you will find that you have descended into the very lowest depths of obscurity and confusion. Who do you suppose is going to understand all the different kinds of values specified in these clauses? I am told there are a dozen or more. Imagine this code in operation. Imagine all the perplexities which will arise. Why, my Lords, everybody will be unsettled; nobody will know where he is, except, perhaps the young man at &#x00A3;500 a year, who, of course, will see a boundless prospect of profitable employment and advancement opening up before him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03374">Then, is it not true that these taxes offer an almost unlimited opportunity for what I am afraid I must call predatory taxation? You are told to possess your souls in patience because you are only going to be charged &#x00BD;d. in the pound for this undeveloped Land Duty. My Lords, if the young man at &#x00A3;500 a year or the Department that he serves chooses to discover that your uninteresting acres have a potential value for some remote purpose your &#x00BD;d. in the pound at once becomes not a &#x00BD;d., but 3s., 4s., or 5s. in the pound, and I need not say that by one turn of the screw nothing can be simpler than to turn the initial &#x00BD;d. into 1d., 2d., 6d., or whatever you please. Then I notice that under these taxes the same people are liable to be taxed not once, but twice, thrice, or four times on the same property, and also that they are liable to be taxed when their property is remunerative, but that they do not get relief when it is unremunerative. Finally, I notice that, although these taxes have been persistently advocated as measures of relief to the sufferers from the rapacity of ground landlords, they do not afford a farthing's worth of relief to the sufferers, and that what is extracted from the ground landlords goes either into the pocket of the Treasury or may be used for some of these marvellous schemes for regenerating something or somebody at
<col>744</col>
the opposite extremity, perhaps, of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03375">The effect of these taxes is certainly not limited to the wealthier owners of land. Noble Lords opposite are great advocates, and rightly so, of a policy for improving the housing of the working classes, and we all support that policy in principle. But surely if that policy is really to be a success is it not desirable that transactions in land should be made as cheap and easy as I possible, and that the enterprise of those who desire to develop land for building should be encouraged, so far as you are able to encourage it? My complaint of this Bill is that it will have precisely the opposite effect. Every transaction in land will be rendered more complicated, and will be penalised by more onerous liabilities under this Bill. The family solicitor used to be regarded as the great obstructor in the way of free trade in land, but I honestly believe that the family solicitor will pale into insignificance by the side of the departmental complications and obstructions which will inevitably grow up if this measure becomes law. I can conceive no greater discouragement either to the man who wants to own a parcel of land for himself or to the man who wants to buy land with the object of opening it up and covering it with buildings than the clauses contained in this Bill. What has stood in the way hitherto of the free adaptation of the land for building, you may depend on it, has not been the want of land, but the want of confidence on the part of those whose capital is necessary to develop it. I think noble Lords opposite must have discovered by this time that this Bill has given a very rude shock to that confidence, and that at this moment the building trade is in a state of unusual stagnation owing to the alarm and uncertainty occasioned by this measure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03376">There is only one justification, so far as I can understand the matter, for these proposals, and that is a justification which noble Lords on that Bench opposite have not the courage to avow. These taxes are justifiable if you believe that land is national property, and that it should be the business of Parliament to nationalise the land of the United Kingdom. That is the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for he has announced that the nationalisation of land must come by easy stages. Here is the first easy stage he presents to us. We
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0379"/>
<col>745</col>
tried the other day to elicit from the noble Earl opposite whether on that point he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are at one, and I trust that when he contributes to the debate on a later day he will give us precise information on that point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03377">If I may sum up, we object to these taxes, first, because they are unproductive for present necessities; secondly, because they tax people on what they have not got; thirdly, because they are cumulative and tax the same people over and over again; fourthly, because they single out for specially severe treatment a class that does not merit such treatment; fifthly, because they fetter and obstruct the land market; and, sixthly, because they are based on a Socialistic fallacy, on which you are acting, but which you have not the courage to avow.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03378">My Lords, it is not only trade in land which has suffered from the alarm created by the production of this Budget. All your taxes&#x2014;your Land Taxes, your Liquor Taxes, your Death Duties&#x2014;all of these are going, if this Bill becomes law, to drive the nation to meet its annual liabilities out of its capital, the consequence being a diminution of the sums which are available for useful investment, and the creation of a feeling of insecurity which will deter those who possess capital from using it within the limits of these islands. This is not an imaginary apprehension on my part. We shall hear, I daresay, in the course of this debate, noble Lords who can speak with special authority on this aspect of the question. I shall be surprised if we do not learn from them that the value of British securities has been shrinking, that British investors are turning their attention more and more away from this country, and more and more towards other countries, and that there is a general feeling of uneasiness and alarm which it would be difficult to exaggerate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03379">I have been supplied within the last few hours with a rather remarkable statement which I may lay before your Lordships. My correspondent has made a comparison between the public issues of the year 1908 and the public issues of the first ten months of 1909. In regard to foreign and colonial issues there has been no change to speak of. When you come to British issues you find that these, which stood at fifty-five and a half millions
<col>746</col>
in 1908, show only twenty millions up to the 6th of the present month. There may be an explanation of these figures, but they seem to me alarming. I know that arguments of this kind do not greatly appeal to the noble Earl and his colleagues. One of them said the other day something of this kind&#x2014;" After all, what is capital? Capital means land, means mines, and means mills. They cannot run away." Who is going to develop the land, who is going to work the mines, who is going to run the mills if you frighten capital out of the country? If the mines remain unworked and the mills remain idle and the land is not developed, who in it that will suffer? What becomes of your poor man's Budget? Will your schemes of afforestation and rural regeneration and so forth compensate the working men if they lose steady and regular employment. I trow not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03380">Now, my Lords, I desire to spend one moment in answering a question which I must assume that the noble Earl would have asked me if he had delivered that unspoken speech. I am sure he would ask how I should find the money which is wanted to meet the present necessities of the country. May I call attention to begin with to the fact that this great group of Land Taxes, which in our view is one of the worst features of the Budget, will not produce anything appreciable to meet present necessities. I do not think that, if we were sitting on the Government Bench, we should propose to spend two millions, at a time when it is difficult to make both ends meet, for the purpose of facilitating the collection of these taxes. I do not think we should defraud the on-licence-holders of the compensation to which you yourselves considered last year they were entitled. I do not think we should proclaim our indifference to the removal of capital at a time when above all others the attraction of capital seems to be necessary for the interests of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03381">But we make no secret of the fact that in our view this Budget is a confession that you have virtually exhausted the possibilities of a financial system based upon free imports. When we find such taxes as are included in this Bill, such direct and such indirect taxes, we ask ourselves whether the time has not come for a reconsideration of the bases of our financial system. I believe that many public men who have been from the first
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0380"/>
<col>747</col>
in theory and by conviction staunch Free Traders are beginning to realise that our single-handed struggle in favour of Free Trade can no longer be continued with any prospect of success. They see that our position of isolation becomes more marked than ever, that foreign countries are raising higher and higher the walls of their tariffs, and that even our own Colonies, which are struggling&#x2014;pathetically struggling&#x2014;to keep the door open for us, are beginning to discern the moment when it will no longer be possible to keep the door open. They see that unemployment is rife, and that business in many quarters is flagging.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03382">And thus it comes to pass that throughout the country people are asking themselves whether we can any longer laugh out of court a financial system under which other countries have so greatly prospered, merely because we regard it as unorthodox from the point of view of the creed under which we ourselves have been brought up. People are asking themselves whether, after all, cheapness is everything. They are asking themselves whether His Majesty's Government, Free Traders though they are, are not continually, and perhaps rightly, introducing changes in the law which have the effect of increasing the difficulties of production and rendering it more difficult for our people to hold their own against their foreign competitors. And I think that many of them are saying to themselves that, even if higher prices were to result from a change in our system, higher prices might not be an unmixed evil if they were accompanied with greater regularity of employment and a freer circulation of capital. These questions have been freely asked for some time past, but they are asked more than ever now when the people of the country are confronted with this Bill. Do not let your Lordships suppose that I am asking this House to pronounce favourably or unfavourably upon this great issue. All we can say is that that idea is present to the minds of a large portion of the people, and the most thoughtful portion of the people of the country; and that being so, we do not feel that we have any right to saddle them with these new and monstrous burdens and to inflict upon them the portentous machinery of this Bill until we know that that is the line along which they wish to proceed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03383">My Lords, I am going to answer another question which I will assume for the sake
<col>748</col>
of argument that the noble Earl would have asked. We shall be asked whether we have considered the consequences of rejecting this Budget. My Lords, we have considered them, and we are ready to face them. What are those consequences? I am told in the first place that there is to be a political deadlock. You will have a Government supported by a huge majority in one House of Parliament, with a minority in the other, and that Government deprived for the moment of the control of the purse. Obviously that would constitute a deadlock. But how long need it last? You hold the key in your own hands. You tell us constantly that you desire to put these issues to the test. Why blame us if we suggest you should do it as soon as possible? Is your Budget so perishable that it will not keep for six weeks?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03384">Then, my Lords, there is a deadlock of another kind. There is a financial deadlock which is described to us in lurid colours. Revenue will cease to come in. There will be no money to pay the troops, or to pay old-age pensions, or to pay even the salaries of His Majesty's Ministers. There will be illegally collected taxes with regard to which proceedings may be instituted. The bonded warehouses will open their doors, the country will be flooded with duty-free tea, and the unfortunate persons who have taken their tea out of bond and paid duty upon it will be ruined. The whole thing is to culminate in a deficit of fifty millions&#x2014;I think that is the accepted figure&#x2014;and in chaos, irreparable chaos. My noble friend, Lord Welby, was invoked a few days ago, and he set out to make our flesh creep, I have read his paper, as I read everything over his signature, with close attention, but my flesh did not creep so very much by the time I had got to the end. Of course, you can have chaos if you want to have chaos, but if you don't want to have chaos I am pretty well convinced you need not have it. And I am rash enough to hazard a conjecture that the noble Earl has got&#x2014;won't say in his pocket or up his sleeve or in his despatch box, but in somebody else's despatch box&#x2014;a nice little scheme for tiding over any temporary difficulties which may arise. It seems to me very probable that if steps of this kind are to be taken successfully&#x2014;and constitutionally&#x2014;that the assistance of both parties will be required. I am here to say with full authority that should that assistance be desired we shall give it loyally and do our
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0381"/>
<col>749</col>
utmost to mitigate any inconvenience that may possibly be experienced. So far, how ever, as that part of the case is concerned, I for one very much prefer temporary dislocation&#x2014;temporary chaos, if you like to call it so&#x2014;to the permanent dislocation and permanent chaos which I honestly believe would arise out of the passage of this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03385">There are yet other consequences which we are told to consider. We are told to think well of the consequences to this House. That is conveyed to us in various tones, sometimes full of solicitude, and sometimes minatory and violent. It is in effect intimated to us that as the penalty of rejecting this Bill we are to expect an attempt to deprive this House of its constitutional right of dealing with money Bills. My Lords, the Constitution, then, is to be fundamentally upset to punish us for doing what Lord Spencer in 1904 and Lord Ripon in 1906 told us we had an absolute and perfect right to do. I am not greatly alarmed by these threats. I recall to mind that, before this Budget was dreamt of, the same threats were held over our heads. We were told long before this Budget could even have been thought of by its authors that the question of the curtailment of the rights of the House of Lords was to be the dominant issue at the next election, and we have actually had before us the egregious scheme of the late Prime Minister for giving effect to that object. We are therefore justified in assuming that, whatever happens, this struggle has got to come. What I would venture to ask those noble Lords who may doubt whether we are wise in facing it now is this&#x2014;Shall we stand better or shall we stand worse when the struggle comes if we shirk our responsibility now?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03386">A great principle is at stake. That comes first. But, after all, even if you choose to set principle aside, what should we gain by refusing to act upon our undoubted rights in regard to this Bill? Depend upon it, my Lords, the people of this country will think worse and not better of us if we have not the courage of our opinions, and do not, as I conceive it to be our duty to do, appeal from you to them. Only one word more. I have been in this House more than forty years, I owe everything to its indulgence, and I say from the depth of my heart that it is my desire that you should do nothing unworthy of your high reputation or your great place in the Constitution of this country. But I believe that the worst and
<col>750</col>
the most damaging thing that you could do would be that you should fail those who look to you as the guardians of their greatest constitutional right, the right to be consulted when fundamental political changes are demanded by the Government of the day; and, my Lords, depend upon it that by rejecting this Bill you will, on the one hand, insist that that right shall be respected; you will not usurp the function of granting aid and supplies to the Crown; you will not pronounce a final verdict upon this Bill, bad though you may believe it to be; but you will say that it is a Bill to which you have no right to give your indispensable consent until you have been assured by the people of the country that they desire it to pass into law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03387">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>To leave out all the words after "That" for the purpose of inserting the following Resolution "This House is not justified in giving its consent to this Bill until it has been submitted to the judgment of the country."&#x2014;(<i>The Marquess of Lansdowne.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03388"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, except, I think, for one or two sentences at the commencement of his speech, the noble Marquess has said hardly anything of the extreme gravity, from the constitutional point of view, of the step which he advises your Lordships to take. A master of debate, no one would have been more competent than the noble Marquess to have expounded to us his views. A master of affairs, no one is more conversant with the history and traditions of the Houses of Parliament, which are not a matter for lawyers merely, but a matter also for statesmen. I will only say, before I proceed to address your Lordships on this subject, that I do not wish to paint any lurid consequences, and I do not wish to speak in the language either of passion or exaggeration, but plainly to lay before the House what is the real nature of this step which your Lordships are asked to take, how unprecedented it is when examined, how subversive of the traditions of Parliament, and how impossible in practice. I wish you to consider the nature of the step that is sought to be taken, the occasion on which it is sought, and the inevitable consequences that will flow from that.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, the noble Marquess assumed that it was within the rights of this House, unquestionably and indubitably, to reject the Finance Bill of the year.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0382"/>
<col>751</col>
If I am asked whether you can do it lawfully, according to law, I answer undeniably yes; and the best test of that is that a Court of law would not give effect to any tax which had been refused by the House of Lords and was not ultimately embodied in an Act of Parliament. But if I am asked whether this House can do it constitutionally, I say&#x2014;in my opinion, no. And the difference between what can be done according to law and what can be done in accordance with the Constitution under which we live is notorious and fundamental. The law definitely fixes rules. What would happen if all the estates of the Realm were to carry out in freedom all the powers which the law entrusts to them? The Crown has enormous powers, and by the Constitution some of them for centuries have not been used. My Lords, it is not to the letter of the law itself that those who wish to govern this country as this country has been governed in the past must look. They must look also and even more to custom, usage, convention&#x2014;call it whatever you please&#x2014;which by inveterate practice had so modified the hard law itself that we are governed more by custom in this country in great matters than we are even by the law.<lb/>
It has been suggested by the noble Marquess that in this case there was a violation of the old traditions of Parliament because there was "tacking." Does he not see himself that whenever he invokes the doctrine of "tacking," that in itself assumes the limitation of the powers of this House? Does the noble Marquess not perceive that by his very argument he admits the limitation to which he has never really alluded? What is "tacking"? More than 200 years ago this House laid down its doctrine upon that subject, and the Resolution then passed is still one of the Standing Orders of the House. It runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The annexing of any clause or clauses to a Bill of aid or supply, the matter of which is foreign to and different from the matter of the said Bill of aid or supply, is un-Parliamentary, and tends to the destruction of the Constitution of this Government."</quote>
Those who framed that Resolution 200 years ago knew very well the difference between the law and the Constitution. What is there in this Bill that in the least degree interferes with the doctrine laid down in that Resolution? Is valuation foreign to and different from the subject-matter
<col>752</col>
of the Bill? It is impossible to raise Land Taxes, you could not raise a shilling of them, except you have a valuation. It is the very basis and the very root of the whole of the Land Taxes which are laid down in this Bill. You may think it all wrong and unwise&#x2014;I am not discussing that&#x2014;but how can it be suggested that there is anything in the nature of "tacking" by reason of the presence of valuation clauses in the Bill when without those clauses the whole of the Land Taxes would of necessity fall to the ground?<lb/>
The noble Marquess suggested that in some mysterious way there is the vice of "tacking" in this Bill, because last year this House rejected the Licensing Bill and here are new licensing clauses inserted in the Finance Bill of this year. These clauses are simply clauses increasing and varying existing taxes. Are we then precluded, under any doctrine of "tacking," from altering the incidence or increasing the burden of existing taxes merely because we unsuccessfully brought in a Licensing Bill last year? I am not surprised that the noble Marquess did not like to dwell upon the constitutional aspect of the subject. What, then, is this Bill? It is not an ordinary Bill. It is not a money Bill in the sense in which it is suggested that any money Bill has ever been thrown out by this House. Is it not familiar knowledge to all students of the Constitution that until the year 1860 there were constantly money Bills brought forward for this, that, and the other tax&#x2014;a number of them in the course of the same year&#x2014;and that they were often so mixed up with other matter that the money provision itself constituted a very small part of the measure?<lb/>
Then in the year 1860, when this House threw out the Bill for the repeal of the Paper Duty, the House of Commons passed a Resolution asserting that they had themselves the power of keeping their own rights inviolate, and the next year they put all the money provisions of the year into one Bill. It was passed by your Lordships. It has been passed ever since by your Lordships. It is the Finance Bill of the year which contains the whole provision of supply of the year, and throwing out that is refusing supplies for the year. It is very open to question&#x2014;Lord Monkswell, who was a great authority, raised in the House of Commons when he was a member of that House the serious
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0383"/>
<col>753</col>
question whether any pure money Bill, small or large, had ever been thrown out by this House. Certainly it never was before 1708. But I will assume, although I do not wholly assent, that it has been done on various occasions in the course of these small and unimportant Bills; but it has never been done&#x2014;never&#x2014;in regard to the finance of the year, and the claim which is put forward now is a claim for the right to refuse supplies. My Lords, how little notice the noble Marquess took of the rights belonging by Constitution to the House of Commons in regard to money Bills&#x0021;<lb/>
Every year all the estates of the realm combine to pay homage to the rights of the House of Commons in regard to money Bills. The Crown itself acknowledges their power. In the Speech from the Throne every year the request for supply is addressed only to the House of Commons&#x2014;to "Gentlemen of the House of Commons," distinguished from your Lordships. The Estimates of the year, upon which, of course, all ways and means must be founded, are never submitted to this House. There are instances in which requests for Estimates, even for a copy of the Estimates, have been refused by the House of Commons. The preamble of the Act which each year grants supply records it to be the grant of the Commons. Every year, frequently, in this very House, the motion is made that privilege Amendments be agreed to&#x2014;that is to say, Amendments which will prevent interference with the privileges of the House of Commons in matters of supply. But the most conspicuous and most significant of all the indications which are so familiar to us all is the practice in regard to money resolutions in the House of Commons. Money resolutions in Committee of Supply are passed without any authority from this House or without consulting it. From the day on which they pass they are acted upon as though they were law embodied in an Act of Parliament, and money is raised, taxes are levied, for the whole of the remainder of the session until the Act has passed into law by virtue merely of the resolutions of the House of Commons. That practice shows the very necessity under which we stand and, therefore, partly the secret of the origin of the practice of the Constitution. It shows the very necessity in which we stand that one Chamber and one Chamber alone shall have
<col>754</col>
the power of the purse. You are obliged to act on the authority of one Chamber because otherwise, as soon as ever the existence of the tax was indicated, and the merchant knew that the tax would be imposed, all the stuff would be withdrawn from the warehouses and the tax would be fruitless. The business necessity is complete and is recognised annually by the practice and the resolutions of the House.<lb/>
The noble Marquess seemed to treat these things very lightly. He seemed to think that a little chaos did not very much signify. Let me tell the noble Marquess what money is now to-day being raised by virtue of the resolutions of the House of Commons passed earlier in this year&#x2014;the whole of the Income Tax, the whole of the Tea Duty, the new or additional taxes upon land, spirits, tobacco, licences, motors, death duties, and stamps. Your Lordships are not accustomed to deal with these things. There is no instance before, in the whole history of this House&#x2014;there is no instance before of this House ever having confronted the problem of what is to be done in the event of Supply being stopped. The absence of precedent and the financial confusion which must follow from the step that is now about to be taken by this House are surely danger signals which must show that we are approaching constitutional shoals.<lb/>
My Lords, I believe that the action you are asked to take is a direct invasion both of the prerogative of the Crown and of the privileges of the House of Commons. The power in this country is divided between King, Lords, and Commons. To the Crown belongs the supreme authority over all, checked by the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility, and by the power of the House of Commons to refuse Supplies. To the House of Commons belongs the control over the purse and therefore the control over Ministers of the Crown, checked by the power of the Royal prerogative of dissolution residing in the Crown. To the Lords belongs the supreme jurisdiction in the administration of justice&#x2014;surely of itself a noble attribute&#x2014;together with a full share in all legislation except finance. There is no check on this House, except the creation of Peers. Such is the ancient and famous balance of power known to our Constitution, the envy of other nations, which
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0384"/>
<col>755</col>
your Lordships are now being invited to overthrow. What must flow from this decision? If it be established that your Lordships can succeed in persuading the country&#x2014;I will not say to condone&#x2014;I will more courteously say to approve the step which is about to be taken, this House, for which elections have no terrors, consisting of men who have not been elected and need not fear that they will not be re-elected, will hold at mercy the House of Commons, and have the Government of the day in the hollow of its hand. If the House of Commons should displease your Lordships, however recently they may have come from the country, you will be able to remit them again to the tortures of the poll. If the Government displease you, all you have to do is to wait for the psychological moment, when some gust of dissatisfaction in regard to their conduct, some momentary displeasure, may be visible in the constituencies, and put an end to them if they happen to be of opinions hostile to your own. No wise man would desire that this House should possess such authority as that, and no man of spirit will submit to it.<lb/>
My Lords, it is said, I know, that all this power will be used very rarely. The only thing the noble Marquess said about it was that he intimated that it would be very rare. That kind of plea is the prelude to every usurpation of power. Moderate and plausible to begin with, it will soon end in gathering into the hands of this House the reins of actual power. I have said that this is in my opinion unconstitutional. It is the first small commencement of an attempt which, if it succeeds, will transfer enormous power to this House and proportionately diminish the authority of the Crown and of the House of Commons. My Lords, it is a step towards constitutional revolution. Will your Lordships allow me now to examine the occasion upon which this encroachment is attempted? I will endeavour to deal separately with the purposes for which the money is wanted and the methods by which it is raised. The motives which have impelled the Government to propose this Budget are no secret. For twenty-five years there has been a constant succession of Reports and of Royal Commissions, Committees, and other more private inquiries in regard to the social conditions prevailing in this country. The microscope, so to speak, has been applied to our social conditions, and the
<col>756</col>
result has been to show that there is a vast increase of wealth, visible in the Income Tax, in the Death Duties, in the inordinate and wasteful luxuries we see around us, tried by every test you please. It has been extended to a great majority of the people. The savings banks and the Post Office show great increases. Trade union funds show an enormous increase; the wages for skilled labour have risen steadily. These things furnish us with reason to congratulate ourselves upon the stability of the country and upon the immense resources that are available to us for the purpose of national improvement.<lb/>
There is a dark side which has attracted notice for years, and especially within quite recent times. The agricultural population has alarmingly diminished, and wages have hardly risen for casual labour; rents have risen enormously; the Poor Law figures are distressingly high, and show signs of increase; the conditions of labour and sweating, especially among women, have been the subject of constant debates and criticism in this House and in the other; overcrowding is an evil dangerous to the very life of the nation; drunkenness is still the greatest curse of this country; crime and insanity have increased, and unemployment has assumed formidable dimensions; there is ground for thinking that a process of physical deterioration is being threatened among our people who have become an urban from being a rural population. I take no pleasure in recording these sad facts, and I do not pretend that His Majesty's Government or that any Government can rapidly cure these evils; perhaps they even cannot cure them altogether at any time. But I say, and we have felt, that it is the duty of every I Statesman to do his utmost to minimise these frightful evils, the extent of which is acknowledged by every one who has given any careful thought to the subject. We do not pretend to be more humane or wiser than other people. Humanity, patriotism, and a sense of safety and all the best motives of human action impel us to do our best for the purpose of remedying this state of things.<lb/>
We have tried. Some things we have not been allowed to do by your Lordships' House. We were not allowed to pass a Licensing Bill, we were not allowed to pass a Small Holdings Bill for Scotland to save our country&#x2014;my country&#x2014;from being
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0385"/>
<col>757</col>
gradually depopulated in the rural districts. But there are things which we have done or which we have promised to do and hope to do. We have extended small holdings in England, we have made by statute some provision against sweating, we shall I hope pass a Bill to deal with housing, we have passed an Act for labour exchanges, and we have announced a system of contributory insurance against unemployment, and we hope we may do the same for sickness and disability. We have passed an Act providing for old-age pensions. These are objects outside the ordinary expenditure of the year and the necessity of selfdefence, these are the objects which have forced us to ask for the large taxes to which the noble Marquess referred. This Budget, except in so far as it provides for ordinary current expenditure, in so far as it exceeds the customary and usual taxes that have hitherto been levied, is intended to meet these purposes, and I do not believe any one of your Lordships will complain of any one of the purposes to which I have referred.<lb/>
Is there anything wrong or predatory in the methods by which the taxes have been raised? It is very remarkable that the noble Marquess attacked every single one of the new taxes which are being imposed. There are some which are levied upon capital, there is a supertax on income. It is said they press too heavily upon wealthy men. I do not doubt that when taxes are imposed upon capital it is a bad thing; when they are imposed upon income it is a bad thing. I do not question for a moment that this tends or may tend to some extent to diminish employment. It is impossible to avoid that. The only alternative is to tax poverty. If you do not tax wealth you must tax poverty. If these taxes are not to be imposed upon income, if Death Duties are not to be imposed, taxation must fall upon the necessaries of life. That is a policy to which we in this Government are wholly opposed.<lb/>
The noble Marquess has also criticised the new taxes imposed on land. It is impossible to enter into details about them on an occasion like this, nor did the noble Marquess himself do so. They are in this country novel and experimental taxes. It may well be that some of them may prove difficult in the working, may require amendment or alteration; that is so and must be so with all experimental and new
<col>758</col>
taxes. But the principle of this taxation is not new in the Colonies; it is not new in Germany or in the United States. It has been approved in the House of Commons, and not this House of Commons merely. In the last House, a Conservative House, the principle of land values was approved by a majority which supported a Bill brought in for that purpose. It is perfectly true that that related to rating. I cannot see, however, how It can be dishonest and unfair to levy taxes on that principle and defensible to levy rates on that principle. I have the highest financial authority of the Conservative Party in support of this principle as applied to taxes. In 1894, when the famous Budget of that year was brought forward, Sir M. Hicks Beach, now Lord St. Aldwyn, speaking in the House of Commons said&#x2014;
<quote>"Let the right hon. gentleman (Sir William Harcourt), if he thinks right, invent means of taxing the increased value of landed property in the neighbourhood of towns. In an endeavour of that kind I will support the right hon. gentleman as readily as anybody, because I think it would be fair. I know there is a great deal of the value of land in towns which at present escapes taxation of every sort, and I think, if it should be possible&#x2014;I know it to be very difficult&#x2014;it would be desirable to remedy that injustice."</quote>
There are Conservative members in the House of Commons many of whom, I believe, supported this principle of taxing land values on their election at the last general election, and it has been supported by the highest economic authorities, apart from political opinions altogether. The tax is a very difficult tax to raise, I know; it is a very difficult tax to adjust; but until this Budget was brought in, although there were a good many individuals who objected to it, I think the principle itself was certainly approved by the whole of the Liberal Party and by a very large part of the Conservative Party as well.<lb/>
The other taxes to which the noble Marquess referred were those relating to licences and the taxes on liquor. Those are increases of existing taxes, and no more suitable subject for taxation, in my mind, exists. These taxes upon liquor have been far too low for a very long period of time. Enormous fortunes have been accumulated by reason of this monopoly, by reason of the value which attaches to it, wholly created by the State. One thing shows how wise these new proposals were. There has been a very large diminution in the consumption of spirits since the time when these taxes
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0386"/>
<col>759</col>
were imposed by resolution by the House of Commons; not only so, but in many parts a large diminution in the cases of drunkenness and in the arrests and convictions for drunkenness. These are among the indirect but most valuable results of the taxes which the noble Marquess so strongly denounced.<lb/>
I cannot dwell in detail upon it but will your Lordships allow me to point out one thing to which no reference was made by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition? If this Budget is indefensible either in whole or in part, if the nation, who are, after all, a just-minded people, are disposed to condemn it, or if harshness or hardship in particular cases arises from it in the working, we have, it must be borne in mind, already gone four years of the six years which are the ordinary duration of a Parliament. In two years, without violating the Constitution, without taking any step such as you are advised to take by the noble Marquess, if the country is with you, you would be able either to repeal these taxes altogether or to modify them in such way as you think fit. Looking at the enormous character of the change that is sought to be effected in circumstances like those, I must say I am astonished that for so slight a cause this House should be prepared to commit themselves to so grave a new departure. The Bill is now no doubt doomed, because whenever any measure proposed by the Government is opposed by I the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition there can be only one conclusion.<lb/>
The sense of the country is apparently to be taken upon this measure. No one will be so simple as to believe that the only question which the country will consider will be the question whether this Bill ought to pass into law. Other and graver questions will be raised. We have been in office for four years, In 1906 our whole time in the House of Commons was taken up by passing an Education Bill. It came to this House. It was wrecked, and the whole labour of that session was thrown away. The following year, 1907, was not a year of very great enterprise of a legislative character. In 1908 the whole time of the House of Commons was spent in passing the Licensing Bill, a measure the loss of which I regret more than I regret the loss of any other. It came up to this House. It was not alive when it came here. It had perished by the stiletto in Berkeley Square before it ever saw this House.<lb/>
<col>760</col>
Now, again in 1909, after a session of unexampled labour, the House of Commons has presented to your Lordships the fruits of many, many months of arduous work in a domain entirely their own; and this House is going to destroy the Finance Bill of 1909 and to refuse Supplies. It is, in my opinion, impossible that any Liberal Government should ever again bear the heavy burden of office unless it is secured against a repetition of treatment such as our measures have had to undergo for the last four years. If we fail in the coming general election, assuming that His Majesty is pleased to dissolve Parliament, it will only be the beginning of a conflict which can end only in one way. If we succeed, I hope we shall not flinch from that which will have to follow. We have not produced this conflict. We have not provoked it, nor at any time desired it, but we are not afraid of it, and I hope that we shall none of us fail to do our duty in preserving the Constitution of our country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03389"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am bound to say that to my mind the noble and learned Lord, after having propounded the question in regard to the Constitution, has run away from it and given us an obituary notice of the present Administration. He has told us that they were extremely diligent and extremely benevolent, and that they had promised a great many things. I should agree entirely with the noble and learned Lord as to their motives and as to the lavish nature of their promises, but after all, I should have expected from the noble and learned Lord what he was quite able to give, something in the nature of a description of what he meant by Constitution. More than once in the course of his speech the noble and learned Lord has said that we are violating the Constitution. I certainly did expect that some exposition of that utterance would have been given. What part of the Constitution are we violating? Shall I tell him what is against the Constitution? The practice of Parliament has been that when a Bill came up for a grant to the Crown, and anything in it was considered to be alien to it, it was considered to be unconstitutional to bring it up; and as late as, I think, 1807, when a Bill was brought up for the malt tax and containing tobacco duties as well, the then Chancellor, in vindication of the privileges of this House, moved that it be disagreed with and rejected, because it contained multifarious matter.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0387"/>
<col>761</col>
The precedent that the noble and learned Lord referred to, and which he called the invasion, or attempted invasion, of our rights was the precedent of 1861, when that ancient and antiquated view of our privileges commenced. What was then done was done with the deliberate intention of evading the power of the House of Lords to reject what was alien. I think there is something alien in this Bill which is before us, but instead of having one Bill upon which your Lordships' judgment is to be taken, there is a whole bundle of Bills which you are asked to take together. If you disagree with one of them, then, according to the noble and learned Lord, we come to the constitutional question. That is a contention which I hope your Lordships will absolutely reject. We have a right to determine what shall be brought up to us in the form of a Finance Bill, and if such a Bill contains multifarious matter we have a right to reject it. If you cannot take away any part of the absolutely simple finance, you must reject the whole, and those who have bundled all these Bills together, in all these different forms of legislation, into one Bill are themselves the persons who are responsible for bringing this difficulty before your Lordships. There may be some parts of this Bill which your Lordships might be glad to pass, but you cannot do it, because that would be making a precedent for a course which I think would be destructive of the privileges of this House.<lb/>
There are in this Bill parts which are in-appropriate to it as a Finance Bill. I will take Clause 33. There you have got the question of appeal. His Majesty's present Administration have a passion for turning everything over to Commissioners. You have two sets of Commissioners. I believe the great difficulty of making Commissioners supreme is this&#x2014;not so much in the possibility of corruption or impropriety or inefficiency on the part of the Commissioners themselves as in the fact that unless you have a decision of a Court of law you do not know by what jurisprudence the Commissioner is guided. In the ordinary Courts of law the great security of the subject is that in dealing with these matters the Judge is himself under the restrictions and must be acting according to the law, but a Commissioner may decide on any point he likes without the least reference to the ordinary system of law.<lb/>
Those who remember the Act of Charles I
<col>762</col>
abolishing the Star Chamber will find the Preamble of that Statute well worth reading. It begins with a recital of all the Statutes by which its authors would protect the liberty of the subject I and the rights of property, and it goes on to show that "it is contrary to the Constitution of this country that there should be any judgment pronounced upon any man's estate or upon any man's chattels except in the Courts and according to the common law." But I am bound to say that they go on with a threat which I should be sorry to see carried into effect to-day. They begin by saying that "any Lord Chancellor or Lord Treasurer, or any person of high station who acts contrary to the true intent and meaning of that Statute shall for the first offence be fined &#x00A3;100," for the second offence a much larger sum and for his third offence he "shall be disqualified from any future office." But the only reason I quote that Preamble is to show that those who are well qualified to form a judgment upon that which contains the elements of public liberty were very careful to show that there must be some system of law administered, and that you must abide by the ordinary Courts, and that you must not hand it over to any one person to administer without the cheek of a known system of jurisprudence. We all know, and no one knows better than the noble and learned Lord, the effect of what is called the rule-making power. In this Bill there are various provisions as to persons who are to be charged and so on, and there is the rule-making power to lay down the rules and conditions under which an appeal may be taken. Certainly the Reference Committees are persons to whom no one could object. They hold the chief practices and the highest offices in England, Ireland and Scotland. They are to make the rules which include, as I pointed out, the question of appeal. But observe what is done. They are to make the rules subject to the consent of the Treasury. That is the ultimate and the highest authority to whom I think no such power could reasonably have been committed.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord has, as it were, given a sketch of the different things which the present Government have done or might have done. Now, my Lords, does he or does he not admit, as it has been admitted over and over again by others, that your Lordships have the right to reject the Bill? If he does, then we get rid of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0388"/>
<col>763</col>
what is called the constitutional objection. I heard in middle life a very great authority in the Liberal Party say that everybody talked about a thing being unconstitutional when they had nothing else to say about it. I think, however, there is such a thing as acting otherwise than in the light and in the spirit of the Constitution, although you may not be doing what is actually in disobedience to law. But what is there unconstitutional here? What is it we propose here? We propose that you should not pass the Bill until it has been submitted to the country and until we know whether the people agree to it or not. Is that unconstitutional? I should think it is one of those things which people would recognise at once as being the fitting and proper thing to do, if there was, as I think there is here in the proposed legislation, a gross departure from the ordinary course of legislation.<lb/>
I do not propose to go through the different parts of the Bill and the systems of taxation involved in it; but there is one mode in which we may look at the Bill in order to sec what its real object and purpose is according to some of its authors. I will admit at once that my noble and learned friend himself is actuated by all the good motive which he has ascribed to his colleagues; but may we not look at what has been said by my noble and learned friend's colleagues in order to form some opinion of what the real object of this legislation is? I do not care about the particular words or about the bad language which I have read; but I remember having read that in cultured Athens there once existed two altars. One was to Impudence and the other was to Insult; and I could not help thinking whether some of the speeches delivered on this subject might not have formed appropriate offerings on these two altars. Apart from the language, however, it is important to consider what is the object of the Minister who proposes such a scheme of legislation as this, in which all these things are to be put together, and according to which your Lordships are to take all of them or none of them. A right hon. friend of mine, a very distinguished lawyer who is now, I think, something in the nature of a soldier, a <i>miles gloriosus</i>, has told us that we must remember that no quarter is to be given; and other speakers, less elegant in their phraseology, have told us that it is time to make these Dukes pay. That is, I suppose, taking the Dukes as representative of your Lordships'
<col>764</col>
House. It was further pointed out by others that they have got a great deal of money and there are a great many other people who have not got any money. What does that mean? If one were dealing with a question of this kind in a crowd I do not know that any one would care very much about it; but conceive a Minister of the Crown who is proposing a most important Bill, or, as my noble and learned friend said, inadvertently, Bills, comprehending so much as they do, and using this language for the purpose apparently of setting the poor against the rich, for the purpose, at all events, of making a sort of attack on those who are very well off and inciting the people to aid and assist him in making the rich men pay, to use his own phrase. Is that the language to be used by an English Statesman speaking of such an important question, as my noble and learned friend described it, as the accounts of the year?<lb/>
May I say that this is a new departure? I do not think that in the whole course of English history one can find any Statesman actually a Minister of the Crown going from place to place denouncing the rich and telling the other classes what they are to get by the Bill which he is sending up to the House of Lords. I do not know whether my noble and learned friend will approve that, but I regret to say I see that some of his colleagues have done, and say that Ministers are entirely harmonious, that they have confidence in each other, and that they are desirous to aid their colleagues in all they have done. I do not know, but it may be that they do not refer to their language, but only to their unity on the Bill or Bills in which they are concerned. Now, part of my noble and learned friend's speech I submit with the utmost respect, was something in the nature of electioneering. He said "We have done so many things, and we have only two more years before you have an opportunity of coming in if the country is dissatisfied with us." What is the meaning of that? Are we to acquiesce in what we believe to be mischievous, unprecedented and unjust, and give them two more years, and then at the end of that time, after we have allowed the principle to be established and the mischief to be done and not till then, to turn them out?<lb/>
My noble and learned friend also said they would tell the people that your Lordships have thrown out this, that, and the other measure, and that the Government will certainly not submit to take office
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0389"/>
<col>765</col>
unless they are secured against the repetition of our conduct. It is the oddest persuasive observations by an orator that I have ever heard. It amounts to this&#x2014;" You, the House of Lords, behave very badly, and I will not belong to you again; I will not come to preside over you, and I will not be a Minister again until your power is taken away; we are not going to stand this kind of action." I doubt whether any deliberative Assembly has ever been addressed before in such language. We did reject the Education Bill in the sense that we made it better, though the noble and learned Lord said that we wrecked it. We refused to acquiesce in the Licensing Bill, and I am glad that we did.<lb/>
But it is pleaded that your Lordships should waive your right so as to enable the Government of the future to have the power of the purse, the House of Lords to have no authority at all. This may be right or it may be wrong; but whose is the revolution, who is it that wants to change the Constitution? We have acted within our right, and we have acted constitutionally as well as legally; but if the noble and learned Lord is listened to, if you dare to do this thing, you shall, he says, have your power taken from you, or the noble Lord and his colleagues will never consent to be Ministers again&#x2014;or, at any rate, some of them. I confess I should not be absolutely disappointed at such a catastrophe. But, my Lords, speaking seriously, I ask whether this is the mode in which your Lordships should be addressed, or in which a deliberative Assembly should be tutored and threatened, though certainly in more elegant and polished language than they are threatened elsewhere. It seems to me that the noble and learned Lord absolutely abandoned the question which I had anticipated I should have had the pleasure of arguing with him. All he said was that our action is unconstitutional. Why? How? In what respect? There has not been one word said on this aspect of the subject. That is not the mode which the noble and learned Lord in a Court of law, or when he is presiding, as he does with great skill and wisdom, over our legal deliberations here would submit to for a moment. If some of those who address him were to say "Such and such a thing is the law," and there is an end of it, he would not submit to that kind of argument. But really this is all that he has done in respect of this measure.<lb/>
<col>766</col>
I do not often disagree with the noble and learned Lord, but I do disagree with him now, and I say that the action of the Government is unconstitutional. I think also that we have acted quite in the light of the Constitution. During the long course of the discussions in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords no one has ventured to question that the Lords have always the power of rejecting any Bill whatsoever. That is the value of a Second Chamber, and this value, in the opinion of many persons, is very great. The noble and learned Lord's suggestion apparently is that we should in future have but one Chamber, because I observe that there is a process of arguing to the effect that, as it is the right of the Commons to have the power of the purse it can do everything and can bring in any kind of legislation. Take the most ordinary case. I will take one which perhaps will commend itself to the noble and learned Lord&#x2014;the Disendowment of the Church. Could they bring that into a Budget Bill? They could do it very easily. I could mention very many modes in which that could be done. And take another case. Take bimetallism. Some people are very fond of the subject. I suppose it would be admitted generally that you could not have such a Bill as that altering the whole law of the currency of the country, unless both Lords and Commons agreed&#x2014;I mean Constitutionally. But if you put bimetallism in this form, you could make some of your taxes and require that they should be paid in silver; and there you have got bimetallism directly. The truth is there is not one subject of legislation which you can imagine that you could not, by a very little ingenuity, bring into this question of its being a simple Money Bill. And if you can do that, and if you can make these precedents which the noble and learned Lord appears to admit only began in 1860, if you can bring all sorts of matters into a Money Bill, I do not know what is the use of this Chamber.<lb/>
We have heard a great deal upon this question. It is said that the House of Lords is always in the way. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack appears to have picked up from the lighter literature on this subject the view that whatever is propounded by a Conservative Government is passed by this House but that, when it is a Government of the other side, nothing is passed, and your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0390"/>
<col>767</col>
are described as an appanage of the Carlton Club. That is absolutely untrue. We have passed a great many things that have been suggested by the other side, and it should always be borne in mind that, until these new-fangled ideas of Constitutionalism appeared and until the great Liberal Party was shattered by Home Rule, this House was much more evenly divided than it is at this moment.<lb/>
And, finally, we are told by my right hon. and military friend that we are to receive no quarter. I suppose there is no one thing which is more degrading to any Assembly than the suggestion that the consequences to themselves or to their order is to affect their conduct, or to be told that "If you do not do this, that, or the other, or venture to question what is done by the other House, we will abolish you," because that is practically what it amounts to. The noble and learned Lord says he will not stand our continued conduct, and that we must act in the manner in which he described. One thing at all events I will say&#x2014;that, if I was to be supposed to be actuated one way or the other because I was threatened with extinction and made to suppose that I would be deprived of all privileges, I would not value a seat in a House which would yield to such a paltry apprehension.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03390"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BRISTOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are just a few minutes before the adjournment for dinner. I have been told that a Bishop should not take part in this debate, because the question is one of mere party strife. If it were, I should certainly not think of taking any part in it. But it is very much more than that. We are told that the fortunes of this House, and the fortunes of the nation and of the people depend upon the issue. If that be so, there is no body of men in this House more called upon to take part in a debate of this kind&#x2014;if the fortunes of the House depend upon the issue of this debate&#x2014;than the occupants of the Episcopal Benches. For we are the only representatives of the ancient constitutional method of entry into this House, namely, that of careful selection on the part of the Sovereign and of all the people to a certain office which office involves a seat in the House of Lords. Careful selection by the King goes on still, and by all the people, because the appointed representative of all the people is the Prime Minister. We, therefore, are the only body which keep up the ancient practice. Further than that, we represent a very much older tenure than

that of the oldest physical hereditary Peer in this House. The earliest tenure that I can trace of physical heredity is 754 years old, and admirably that Earldom is filled to-day. But there are three persons actually sitting on these Benches now whose tenure is 550 years older than that, and there are no fewer than ten other members on these Benches whose tenure is from 450 to 550 years older than the oldest of the physical hereditary Peers, we having a spiritual heredity. I maintain, therefore, that if there is any question of the honour of this House, from these Benches at least some words should come in support of the honour of this House.<lb/>
In my judgment, in cases of great complexity, the simpler the issue you can raise, the better. The issue before us this evening is a very simple one in itself, though the consequences may be tremendous. I have heard all sorts of suggestions made as to how this contest could be evaded. My Lords, I am not in favour of evasion. I am in favour of something direct, and therefore I am in favour of the proposal of the noble Marquess opposite. I am bound to add this, that when I came into this House, I had no conception I should have to say what I am going to say, namely, that if your Lordships' House give way to the threat from the noble and learned Lord who presides over our deliberations, you will deserve to be put an end to. When that threat is made, I am bound to stand up and say that for the honour of this House, I sincerely trust that it will affect no single member of the House otherwise than to drive him to vote with the noble Marquess.<lb/>
But the members of these Benches have a much more important part to play than anything of that kind. All of your Lordships know a great deal about the condition of the poorest classes in society, from what you call the lowest to what may be called the highest in the social scale. As a matter of fact it is not the business of anyone of your Lordships, except those of us here on these Benches, to know, and to know intimately, not the conditions only, but the persons of all classes in the social scale in our respective dioceses; and I claim that there are no men sitting in this House who know so completely from one end of the social scale to the other, the conditions, the needs, the wants and the demands of every class of the community as we do. We are obliged to know, especially those of us who represent
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0391"/>
<col>769</col>
a great city, as I do, the terrible conditions of the very poor. We are obliged to know the great want of employment that affects men who can do excellent work. We are obliged to know the conditions of the artisan, of the shopkeeper, and of the professional classes, and even higher than that. Many of us have to know the condition of very great capitalists who perhaps farm a little for their own amusement but who have the whole of their income to spend; and we know, and know intimately, some large landowners who, far from having the whole of their income to spend, have a very narrow margin indeed. All this we have to know intimately as our official business; and although the noble and learned Lord took credit to the Government for having passed certain ameliorating measures, I suppose it was this House that passed them. And it always will be so&#x2014;when direct measures for the benefit of the very poor are brought forward, this House will give them no niggardly support. But look at the proposals of this Bill. I cannot conceive how the conditions of the very poor in my own large city, for instance, will be amended at all, nor indeed how the position of the working classes who actually now get wages will be improved.<lb/>
I may have heard the noble and learned Lord wrongly, but I thought he said it was quite possible that under some of these proposals affecting capital there might be a little less work here and there; but quite apart from that, my Lords, I do not see how this Bill is to produce a change that we, at any rate, demand, that legislation connected with the poor shall produce some direct and simple improvement in their position. I see nothing at all if the ultimate event comes about, that is, the ultimate result of these proposals now brought before us, but this: a dull monotonous level of poverty without any redeeming points at all. We all of us know the familiar joke with regard to persons on a certain island who had to employ one another. They had no money to pay each other, and the old joke was that they could only live by taking in each other's washing. But, my Lords, there is another and a very serious point. Some twenty of us on these Benches have the privilege of reading prayers in your Lordships' House, and the culminating point in the special prayer for Parliament which so many of your Lordships heard this evening is this: the result of your deliberations
<col>770</col>
is to be "the uniting and knitting together of the hearts of all persons and estates within the realm in true Christian love and charity one towards the other."<lb/>
That is to be the culminating effect of the deliberations and the legislation of this House. Some of us are accustomed, when we are considering a proposal, to ask ourselves what is the exact argument which the author of the proposal thinks most cognate to it, and thinks best as a means of urging it upon the attention of the people. Now, my Lords, we know who is the official author of this Bill. Not to say a word about his Parliamentary utterances, I only ask your Lordships to consider his speeches out of Parliament, and particularly one delivered near my old I charge when I was in Stepney&#x2014;made in certain language and with evident motive. If the intention of this Bill is to be judged, as I maintain it may fairly be judged, by the expressions of its author in pressing it upon public attention, well, there is nothing in the world for this House to do but to pass the Amendment of the noble Marquess. On the whole survey of the matter, while earnestly desirous to do everything I possibly can for the amelioration of the conditions of the poor and the working classes, I am quite clear myself&#x2014;may be very wrong&#x2014;that my vote shall be given for making it as sure as we can make it, that those whom the Amendment trusts, whom those who are against it will not trust&#x2014;namely, the people of this country&#x2014;shall have the chance to express their opinions distinctly for or against these proposals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03391"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not quite able to follow the argument of the right rev. Prelate, though I followed his conclusion that he meant to vote for throwing out the Budget. The right rev. Prelate not only claimed an antiquated tenure, but said he descended from a spiritual tenure, and not from an earthly one. He also made the declaration that he and his brother Prelates knew more about the conditions of all classes of the community, cared more about them, and generally had a more earnest desire to benefit them than anyone else. It seems disrespectful to put anything like a note of interrogation to any of his statements.</membercontribution></p>

<col>771</col>
and our official business only, to know these things.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03393"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: If the right rev. Prelate meant that it was his duty to know these things, but did not, that alters the position. However, I will only say on this point, that if I could examine the history of the right rev. Bench and note their attitude towards the innumerable cases of progressive legislation urged upon Parliament during the last 100 years&#x2014;if they knew all this, they dissembled their love very successfully. I am glad, however, that there is a desire to act upon the words in the prayer spoken of by the right rev. Prelate, and to work for the whole nation. I only wish the right rev. Prelate would remember some other weighty and valuable words in that prayer&#x2014;" to put aside all partial affection."<lb/>
I think if there is one thing we need more than another, it is that we should clear ourselves from association with class, from professions, from all those things that prevent us from having that high light which is so important if we want to deal with intellectual and social problems. And I cannot help thinking that the right rev. Prelate did not seem to bring quite that high light into the matter in considering how he proposed to ameliorate the condition of the poor which he said, from his knowledge of Bristol and Stepney, it was his desire to do. We have had to-night from all three speakers who have spoken from the Opposition side, a great deal of abuse of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We know it is a good maxim "when you have no case, abuse the plaintiff's attorney." And it seems to me that that is very much the way this Budget is being treated. I think anyone would be very sorry to have to defend all the speeches of his friends or political associates at any time. We could get plenty of stones to throw at each other, and I expect we shall have an ample supply of these missiles furnished to us from both sides in a very short time.<lb/>
After all, however, the question for us to consider is the Budget and its alternative. As the right rev. Prelate declared his intention of supporting the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, I suppose I may take it that he considers the best remedy for the suffering and misery that he sees in the crowded streets of the city where his
<col>772</col>
See is placed, is in this Tariff Reform which is indicated in the speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. I do not wish to discuss the question of the details of the Budget, or of the alternative scheme, but I would invite the right rev. Prelate to go down to Bristol and address a crowded meeting of those persons in whom he takes a great interest, and ask them whether they would rather have their bread and other articles of food taxed, or whether they would prefer that some of the surrounding land should pay some contribution to the burdens of the State. I think it might be an interesting discussion. But I wish to say, my Lords, that I consider any discussion of the details of the Budget entirely irrelevant to the issue before us.<lb/>
The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition made a most interesting speech, one which had many points in it, and I think had some true points in it. You cannot have a large and comprehensive financial scheme that has not some new proposals in it which probably twelve months' experience would show might be altered in detail. But it seems to me that the speech, or at any rate, the heads of the speech would have been more weighty if it had been delivered in Committee in the House of Commons. They were criticisms of particular parts of the Budget, and by admission to-day, outside the scope of your Lordships' House. May I turn for one moment to the Earl of Halsbury who spoke last but one? Of course, nobody disputes that there is a legal right to throw out this Bill. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack admitted it practically, but I was very glad to hear the noble and learned Earl admit that he did not wish to join with that class of person who took that objection because he had nothing else to say. The noble Earl distinctly admitted that there was such a thing as usage and practice. It may not be inscribed in the Statute Book, but it may and ought to have great weight with this House. May I remind the House of the words of Tennyson: "Freedom broadening slowly down from precedent to precedent." That is not law, but it is far more weighty than law.<lb/>
In some respects we know the law of our Constitution remained unchanged from the times of the Plantagenets. Does anyone suppose that you can go to the text of old musty Statutes, and not look at the informing
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0393"/>
<col>773</col>
spirit which from generation to generation embodies the substance while preserving the form? That is one of the things which interests foreigners most when they come to this country. They come to England and see the old hermit crab-like shell inhabited by a completely new organism. We live in our old medi&#x00E6;val garments, and they seem to stretch until they fit; but if you want to turn them into a suit of real armour, you will find your movements greatly hampered, and you must adapt your ideas to the real purpose and spirit of this generation. The right rev. Prelate gave us a noble declaration of courage and earnestness in not yielding to threats, and he told us how that would determine him to vote for the Amendment of the noble Marquess. But I rather think the right rev. Prelate had come down determined to vote for the Amendment before ever he heard any threats. It is no use our being humbugs in any way. When this Amendment was put down, everybody knew that the question of the Finance Bill was at once taken beyond the region of this House. It was taken into the arena of politics before the nation. I am not going to trouble myself with the details of the Constitution, but I certainly think it is the Crown, and not the House of Lords, that has the right to determine upon a dissolution. But when you appeal to C&#x00E6;sar you must abide by the decision of C&#x00E6;sar. You cannot limit C&#x00E6;sar in the way in which he will deal with the case. It would be childish for us to pretend that we do not know that the issue which will go to the country will not be the issue whether this Budget shall or shall not pass. It is also childish to say you are being threatened. The issue that is going to the country is, what shall be the future relations of the House of Lords to the representatives of the people? We know perfectly well that that is the issue which will be fought out. Will anyone in this House say that in the distribution of power and responsibility in this country the House of Commons has not been hitherto the predominant partner? No one pretends to say that the House of Lords has any constitutional claim to be treated as the equal in importance in the State with the House of Commons. How are the relations between the two Houses to be preserved? They are to be preserved with a good deal of jarring and friction; but still, the two Houses have jogged on from time to time. Of course, before the Reform Bill they
<col>774</col>
jogged along, because the House of Lords was then practically predominant in the House of Commons. They looked after that, either by means of the rotten boroughs or through the great landowners. It takes thirty years or more&#x2014;it takes a full generation&#x2014;before a great constitutional change works out in the minds of the people so as to have its full weight in Parliament; but we have been moving now for two generations since the Reform Bill when Mr. Disraeli gave us household suffrage in the boroughs, and the people are coming more into their rights. I do not know whether you would call it their rights, but they are coming more into their dominion. The great masses of the people and the electorate are and will be supreme. Now, it is important that there should be some moderating power behind the supreme popular power which can in a way exercise some kind of check, but the only security for that kind of check is that this secondary power will bear in mind its own inferiority. If they will use what power they have with great tact and discretion, a Constitution which theoretically invites all sorts of complexities will go on; but if you are not content with having a Constitution as a series of understandings and forbearance and adjustments to the time&#x2014;if, instead of that, you determine to force the stronger party to set forth clearly what those rights are to be, you will have on the Statute Book some restrictions which have hitherto depended upon your own tact. When Lord Halsbury repudiated the idea of any connection between the Tory Party and the Carlton Club he said, "Look what Liberal measures we have passed which the Tories dislike." That is perfectly true. My impression is that this House will always pass any Liberal measure when the active Conservative Members of the House of Commons tell them that the time has come to give way, and that they cannot afford, having regard to the constituencies, to fight any more. That is the measure of the Liberalism of this House. They give way when the Tory Party in the House of Commons think it is time to give way. If the Tory Leaders in the House of Commons say, "Fight a little longer," they fight a little longer; but this time they have carried it a little too far. And my impression is, that if this dissolution does come, the people of this country will give you an answer not only about the Budget but about one or two other questions which might very well have been left sleeping.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03394"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to trouble the House with any reference to my own affairs with regard to the Budget. I believe it is not considered, nor has it been considered during the platform campaign, that it is good form for anybody under the rank of a Marquess to talk about his own affairs. I belong to that equally struggling but still more deserving class of the Barons. But let me tell your Lordships that the ancient Manchester school, and the modern descendants of the Manchester school of the Gladstone and Harcourt administrations, have produced in me a complete object lesson of the wealthy class that they have tried to destroy in this country without any assistance from this Budget at all. I welcome this Amendment from every possible point of view&#x2014;not only from the legal point of view which, for my part, I do not know very much about&#x2014;but from the constitutional and also from the point of view with regard to our moral obligations towards the electors of this country.<lb/>
I may say that I have not formed this decision from reading either the <i>Observer</i> or the <i>National Review</i>; but I have been to a great many meetings in all parts of England with regard to this Budget, and the experience that I have had there, and the other means that I have conscientiously endeavoured to take to discover the feelings of the people with regard to the Budget, lead me to the sincere and honest conviction that the vast majority of the thinking people in this country look to the House of Lords to save them from the tyranny of that small knot of Cabinet Ministers who have managed somehow to gain the mastery over their colleagues, and to get the control for the time being of the House of Commons. For every reason, therefore, I desire, with a perfectly clear conscience to support the Amendment of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
In considering a question like this, tactical considerations are, to my mind, entirely out of place. I have not the slightest doubt that the noble Marquess has received all sorts of views, from the wild threats of the street corner agitator, to the more sober counsels and the gloomy forebodings of those friends of the Constitution whose desire to preserve that Constitution sometimes, I think, competes favourably, and sometimes unfavourably, with their desire to preserve the Cobdenite tradition. But
<col>776</col>
if there is one argument brought before us as a reason why we should not accept this Amendment, and which, to my mind, is more immoral than any other, it is what you have heard in private conversation:&#x2014;" Oh&#x0021; give the Radicals a little more rope, and they are sure to hang themselves." That is a consummation which I should look upon with the most unmitigated satisfaction, but, at the same time, I do think that the people of this country, while this process was going on, would be submitted to something very terrible indeed, from which they look to the House of Lords to save them. But if you do wish to consider this from the point of view of tactics, there is not the slightest doubt that the worst tactics which your Lordships could possibly be guilty of would be to run away just at this particular moment. The worst tactics that your Lordships could be guilty of would be to accept the Budget.<lb/>
The Radical Party, during all the summer and ever since this discussion began, have been trying to force the House of Lords into a position that we used to be in at school in which tactical considerations were entirely dishonourable or out of place&#x2014;the position of replying to the question:&#x2014;" Will you fight or take a licking? "I do not think that those who took the undignified course of putting up their hands and taking a licking ever made a single friend or converted a single enemy to their side. Supposing your Lordships take a licking over the Budget, and say that you are frightened by all these threats, and that you will pass the Budget, we shall be simply driven first from one untenable position to another which will be much more untenable, and from which, after the first retreat, it will be absolutely <i>a fortiori</i> more and more impossible to recover the ground that we have lost. It has been suggested that if the House of Lords is amenable to what the Radical Party want it to do, they perhaps will not look at us so hardly in the future. I think we ought to consider what happened to the soldier in, I believe, the South African war, when he begged a man on the other side to spare his life, and he would give him all his money. The other man took the money away from this unfortunate man, who was on the ground, and then he shot him. That is exactly what will happen to us. We shall not receive any more lenient treatment from the Radical Party, and those who wish to abolish the House of Lords will not change
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0395"/>
<col>777</col>
their attitude in the future, however amenable we may be at the present moment.<lb/>
Supposing that this House does accept the Budget, we shall have both Houses of Parliament definitely committed to a policy of Socialism, and nothing else but Socialism; and there will be a perfectly legitimate and natural demand for the abolition of the House of Lords both by its former friends and by its enemies. Now, we have heard a great deal about the constitutional argument to-night. I should like to have heard more. It has never been properly explained to me&#x2014;and I do not suppose it ever will be&#x2014;but it has never been satisfactorily shown to me that it is really unconstitutional for the House of Lords to pass the Amendment proposed by the noble Marquess. I was always given to understand in the very imperfect legal knowledge which I managed to imbibe at Oxford, that there is no written Constitution about the matter at all, and that in times of stress and emergency and difficulty the people of this country did not turn to black-letter authorities, or works on Constitutional Law, any more than when a huntsman has lost his fox in the middle of a field, he takes a book out of his pocket to see whether he should cast "up wind" or cast "down wind."<lb/>
The people of this country will judge this matter on the ground of common sense and on the ground of practical utility, and though I have a very great respect for the Constitution, I do not believe the average elector cares the least bit about the Constitution, provided he gets what he wants. He very rightly recognises that the Constitution of this country was made for England, and not England for the Constitution. But do you not think it is a very strange argument to lie in the mouths of noble Lords opposite and their friends; this newly-found respect for the Constitution of this country? All these arrangements with regard to conventions and precedents were perfectly good and right and ought to have been respected, so long as both great parties in the State played the game according to the recognised rules. But when those rules are deliberately broken by noble Lords opposite, then the time comes when the rules of the same may have to be slightly altered.<lb/>
We have already heard from the noble Marquess, to whose speech, if he will allow
<col>778</col>
say to say so without impertinence, I desire to pay my most respectful tribute of admiration, how other Bills have been incorporated in the Bill which is now called the Finance Bill. But Radical Cabinet Ministers have made no secret about it. They always said they would incorporate in a Finance Bill those measures which the House of Lords did not pass in a form which was acceptable to themselves. The prophecy that they would put "swinging taxation"&#x2014;I do not know what it means, although I think we are beginning to learn&#x2014;on the brewers, was the only prophecy which Mr. Ure has ever made which had the slightest semblance of truth. It is the one thing in which he has some amount of claim to a certain amount of accuracy. The Prime Minister also told us that if he did not get his own way in the House of Lords with regard to this and other measures, that "the resources of civilisation" were not yet exhausted. We are now getting in the House of Lords, and we shall get it all through this debate from noble Lords opposite, at any rate a bowdlerised version of this Budget. But behind all this there lies the intention to set up a Single Chamber Government in this country, and that is just exactly what I honestly believe the electors in this country are at last beginning to realise.<lb/>
We have also been told something about the chaos that is going to result supposing we do not pass the Budget. I do not think I shall be much beside the mark if I suggest that the blood of this Budget will have to be on the heads of its authors. They have introduced the Budget. They have caused all the trouble. If they had considered it in the likelihood of its being passed, they would have foreseen they would have had a very great deal of difficulty in getting both Houses of Parliament and the electors in this country to approve of it. If the Budget is killed, as I honestly believe it will be by the people, then the chaos that results will be due to to its authors, and they will have no one to blame except themselves for it. They have not backed up this Budget either in the country or in the House of Commons like men who have confidence in it.<lb/>
I should very much like to know what the Treasury officials thought of this Budget before it saw the light of day, and whether they found themselves in accord with the proposals which the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0396"/>
<col>779</col>
Chancellor of the Exchequer tried to get them to translate into an Act of Parliament. But there is no doubt that no sooner did this Budget sec the light of day than it was forthwith condemned by the whole expert opinion of this country. It was condemned by financial opinion, practically by the vast mass of commercial and professional opinion, by auctioneers, agents, land surveyors and nearly all of the professional classes, as being utterly unworkable and quite impracticable. But not only that. They have taken into their hands in the House of Commons every single sort of weapon that they could find or forge in order to pass this Budget through that House. The exaggerated use of the closure has been repeated so often that I will not labour that point. But there is another point which is straining the Constitution, and that is the handing over in the House of Commons to an official whom they have appointed Chairman of Committees the power of selecting what Amendments should be argued or not. That is an arbitrary method of managing the House of Commons, and to say that a House of Commons managed in this way represents the settled will of the people is utterly beside the mark, and will not hold water for a single moment.<lb/>
We have also got Mr. Lloyd-George's speeches and the speeches of Mr. Winston Churchill in the country. I should very much like to know, and I do hope that the noble Earl opposite will give us an answer before this debate is over&#x2014;" Does he or does he not approve of that style of oratory of which his colleagues have been guilty?" That is what we really must know before this debate is over. I, for one, cannot believe it for a single moment&#x2014;I cannot associate in my own mind the distinguished and courteous manner of the noble Earl with the utterances of his colleagues on the public platform. I do not believe for a moment that he approves that sort of thing. I do not like to think that the noble Earl is like the Lord Scamperdale, who was perpetually regretting that because he was a Lord he could not swear or use coarse language, and he had to keep his "Jack Spraggon" to do the dirty work for him&#x0021; I sincerely hope that the noble Earl will dissociate himself from his "Jack Spraggon." But although Mr. Lloyd-George is still entirely separated from the very courteous demeanour we are accustomed to from the
<col>780</col>
noble Earl opposite, I am rather sorry to see that he has got something like a promising pupil in the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War who went down to a public meeting somewhere or other last Wednesday and said that this Amendment was cant. That is, if the noble Lord was rightly reported. I do not think anybody who heard the statesmanlike speech of the noble Marquess to-night will say that he was speaking in terms of what we are accustomed to call "cant." But the noble Lord was also reported to have gone on to say that if the Budget was rejected by the House of Lords it would be because the Dukes did not like it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03395"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03396"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I am delighted to hear that the noble Lord did not assent to all this clap-trap about the Dukes. I am not at all surprised, because I never really believed him guilty of such a thing, or that he would associate himself with this calumny which is being spread against the Lords that they are going to reject this Budget on account of self interest.<lb/>
We have been told by several people, by the enemies of the House of Lords on the one side, by friends of the Budget and by some of the people who are a little faint-hearted from time to time on our own side, that the Budget is very popular in the country. I am not at all so sure about that; but there is one thing that will decide it, and that is a reference to the people of this country. If noble Lords opposite think the Budget is popular in the country time will show, and they will be returned at the next General Election. There is not the sightest doubt that, at a certain time during the discussion of the Land Clauses and the way they were produced before the country&#x2014;I suppose with the more ignorant of the population, whose cupidity was easily played upon owing to straitened circumstances&#x2014;they were to a certain extent popular. It is very easy. It is a very well known device&#x2014;and it has been done hundreds of times ever since there was a Radical Party in this country, which is a good many hundred years ago&#x2014;to raise a cry against the landowners. It is a part of the tactics which the Radical Party always indulge in. It is very easy to play to the passions of the mob; but the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0397"/>
<col>781</col>
injustice of the unearned increment has already been very ably pointed out by the noble Marquess. Let me tell noble Lords opposite that the working classes of this country are beginning to realise what all this means about unearned increment.<lb/>
The Government cannot remain in office except by the consent of the Socialists and the extreme Radicals; and this proposal about the unearned increment they believe, will, in a very short time, be applied to all forms of property. All this sort of thing is bound eventually to filter down to the working classes of this country. The form of taxation recommended by the Radical Party will very soon resolve itself into this sort of thing with regard to unearned increment. When any citizen happens, in vulgar parlance, to "make a bit" by his own energy or thrift or good luck, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will step in, and having labelled him a "black-mailer" or a "swindler" he will not put an end to the transaction, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer will then go shares in the plunder. Yes, but what for? To provide a revenue for Old Age Pensions or something of that sort would be the reply. But I think you will find it will eventually be applied to advancing the schemes of this or that body, whether Socialists or somebody else, probably equally as bad, whom it may be desirable to placate in order to keep the Government in office as long as they possibly can. There is no doubt that the working men of this country are beginning to have a very uncomfortable feeling that the rhetoric of Mr. Lloyd-George and the vulgarity of the President of the Board of Trade will not fill many empty stomachs or replenish many bare cupboards during the coming winter. And they will not see the advantage of paying a whole horde of officials to pry into the public life of everybody in this country, and who will be paid from money taken from the beer and the spirits and the tobacco consumed by the working men. I may mention that the taxation on champagne is not increased at all. The luxuries of the rich men contribute hardly anything towards the taxation of this country.<lb/>
I will not go into the details of the Budget at any great length, but, for my part, I find fault with the Budget as a financial proposal more than any thing else because it
<col>782</col>
leaves untouched so many rich people who deserve to be taxed, and whom I admit it is very difficult to get at. There is a growing class of rich people in this country who have a position of freedom with a lack of responsibility that is unknown I should think to the inhabitants of any other country, and they are the people whom I, for one, should like to get hold of. They have been created and flourish under a system of free imports, and it is only by taxing the luxuries of these people that you will get at them at all. I do not wish to single out any particular class for attack, or else I may be accused of adopting the tactics of noble Lords opposite; but they are a class not particulaly productive considering the small amount of interest they take in public life; and if they could be got at in the interests of the taxpayer, I would heartily support any clause of that kind. They can easily import a great many of their luxuries from abroad. It has been estimated, although I am not going to give a lecture about Tariff Reform, that &#x00A3;28,000,000 worth of luxuries come into this country for use, absolutely free, which these people enjoy.<lb/>
We are told that there will be chaos supposing this Bill is not passed into law. Well, I have already suggested that the House of Lords will not be responsible for that chaos; but I should think that the Budget itself has already produced a good deal of chaos. Capital has gone out of the country already, and as a direct result of this Budget a very great number of working people have already been thrown out of work; but it is practically impossible to measure the chaos that would result from the acceptance of this Budget. The whole of the civilised world, "all nations, peoples and languages," who are at all interested in the question of free institutions, and the unity of this kingdom and the well-being of the British Empire, are looking at these proceedings with very anxious eyes indeed to see who gets the best of it; and if the House of Lords does accept the Budget in the way we are asked to do, a blow and a shock will be delivered against national and Imperial security from which the country will perhaps never recover. This is the main reason why I unhesitatingly vote for the Amendment of the noble Marquess, because, in the language of Lord Rosebery in the letter he sent to <i>The Times</i> when the Budget was first introduced, it is "a revolution." It is nothing else.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0398"/>
<col>783</col>
It is not the slightest use for noble Lords opposite to deny, as we shall hear in this debate, that they have surrendered, they and their Cabinet, to the forces of revolution and to the forces of Socialism. Where do they get the driving force from for their Budget? Where do they get the support which enables them to carry it on at all? They get it from the extreme men and from nobody else but the extreme men. They certainly do not get it from Lord Joicey and Sir Robert Perks and those pillars of the Liberal Party who have so to speak "arrived." And I do not think they get a very great deal of real support from those other old pillars of the Liberal Party who have not yet "arrived" but who expect to get some of those good things which ultimately come to all good Radicals, and who, in the meantime, are obliged to go about giving good words with their mouths, and curses in their hearts for the Budget, and a sincere hope that the House of Lords will have nothing to do with the Bill that is before Parliament at the present moment. It is not the Conservative Party who say that this Bill is an instalment of Socialism. We take it from the Socialists themselves. They must know their own article when they see it, and we have been assured both at home and abroad that in this Bill they recognise their pet doctrines and propaganda in a form which exceeds their wildest expectations. Therefore, it is not our description of the Bill when we say that this is a Socialistic measure; and Socialism was not one of the things which appeared in the electioneering addresses of Cabinet Ministers and Radical candidates for Parliament at the last General Election &#x0021;<lb/>
In the speeches of noble Lords opposite we shall not hear very much about the extreme character of these proposals. Mr. Asquith, the Prime Minister, went down to Birmingham with the express idea, as I understood it, of making a speech which would enable respectable people, of whom we have just had a definition from the Earl of Halsbury, as being those who have not been convicted of felony, to accept this Budget. The idea of that speech, as I understood it, was to persuade respectable people to accept the Budget; but it was impossible for the Prime Minister to keep out the purely Socialistic doctrine from that speech. Having been called upon to speak a little earlier in the debate than I had anticipated, I have not got the exact quotation with me, but this is a fairly accurate translation
<col>784</col>
of what the Prime Minister said: "That there were certain sums of money which would be far more fruitfully and much better employed if they were taken away from the individual and given over to the State and spent on things which might be thought for the good of the State." If that is not Socialism, I really do not know what is.<lb/>
Then we are told that we are violating and over-riding the will of the people. All this talk about the voice of the people is cant. It is real cant of the purest description. It is an utterly meaningless phrase, and is merely part of the stock-in-trade of the agitator and of the demagogue. The will of the people is not expressed on this subject at this moment in the House of Commons. Representative government in this country is at an absurd discount, and the talk about representative government and free institutions has now resulted in this sort of thing: that we are the only Government in the whole of the civilised world that is not being dominated and controlled by a small section of Socialists. With regard to the will of the people, I, for one, have not the slightest anxiety about referring this Budget to the people.<lb/>
What most moderate men are asking us to do is to save them from being jockeyed and bullied and bluffed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade into accepting a Budget and a policy for which there was not the slightest mandate at the last General Election. If you Lordships embrace this policy, then I can only say, ' Heaven help England. "The late Mr. Bromley-Davenport wrote an extremely amusing parody upon" Locksley Hall" which has been described by a ripe critic of literature as one of the finest things in the English language. I hope it will not be considered out of place if I quote something from it.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03398"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel some embarrassment in addressing the House owing to the present state of the Benches. But perhaps you will bear with me if I keep things going until there is a larger attendance and some more gifted orator to follow me&#x2014;I trust from the other side. We have not heard much from that quarter. As one of the rank and file of the House I am anxious to explain why, in spite of the sonorous caution which we had to-night from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, I still feel it my bounden duty&#x2014;although at the moment I am shrivelled up and pulverised by that address&#x2014;to support the Amendment of the noble Marquess on the Front Bench of this side of the House. The noble and learned Lord warned us in stirring language that the action which it is proposed to take is unconstitutional. The noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, who has previously filled the office of Lord Chancellor, assured us that it was constitutional, and the noble Lord who spoke immediately preceding the dinner hour urged us to take no heed of cither because the people of this country do not care any tiling at all whether the action is constitutional or not. I presume the noble Lord intended that as somewhat rhetorical, for I am quite sure he agrees with me that, whatever the people of the country may feel about constitutional procedure, it does behove every member of this House to have a jealous regard to what is in the true interests of the Constitution. And I venture to believe that those who support the Amendment now before the House are acting more truly in the spirit of the Constitution than those who wish this Bill to pass without the people of the country having any opportunity of expressing their opinion upon it.<lb/>
The Lord Chancellor drew, or attempted to draw, a very fine distinction between what was legally possible for this House and what was possible from the constitutional point of view. He pointed out that law was one thing and the practice and the Constitution another. It seems to me
<col>786</col>
he drew that distinction so finely that it is quite justifiable for us to consider to what extent we are bound to go into technicalities and constitutional procedure, or to what extent we ought rather to follow the course which we believe is the most constitutional from the point of view of the duties which this House has to discharge towards the Constitution of the country. And though dialectic arguments are used to show, or attempt to show, that within the four corners of this Bill there is nothing outside the ordinary contents of a Bill for providing the Supply for the year, if those efforts are made, it does seem to me that if we are to play our part of a Second Chamber&#x2014;if we are to justify the trust placed in us by those who look to us to discharge that duty&#x2014;if we are to safeguard from dangers the country we have to serve, we have to consider not so much nice and subtle distinctions as to whether this clause or that clause does or does not go beyond the ordinary action of a Finance Bill, but we have to consider also the spirit in which those clauses are framed, the declarations of those who promote the Bill, and to ask ourselves honestly, apart from all subtle distinctions, whether there is or is not lurking in the background behind this Bill, and contained more or less in its provisions, a danger to the country which, whether it may prove to be beneficial or not, is a real danger. Is it dangerous and disastrous, or on the contrary may it prove to be a boon? Whichever it is to be, at all events it is a question which the country ought to have the opportunity of deciding. I am bound to say, from the point of view of tactics, I should be sorry indeed to make a prophecy or form an opinion.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack held out to us a terrible picture of what was to come. We should be robbed of our powers or we should have the pain of seeing the Benches opposite entirely denuded of opponents at our debates. The noble Marquess who spoke first to-night said he had been forty years in this House. I am sorry to say I think I can run neck and neck with him in that respect. I think he will bear me out in saying that no great debate has taken place in this House in which we have differed on any great question of principle, but we have been assured the doom of the House of Lords is sealed at last. It has been the regular peroration of every speech,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0400"/>
<col>787</col>
and I fully expected the noble Earl who leads the House when he moved the Second Reading of the Bill to-night would wind up in that accustomed form. I am quite sure when we have the gratification of listening to him later in the debate he will close his remarks with a peroration of that description. I do not pretend, when I say that, to convey that I quite ignore the warning of the noble and learned Lord. I believe, if the reason, commonsense and intelligence of the people of this country were allowed to prevail, they would clearly see that in giving them the opportunity of expressing their opinion on this measure the House of Lords is doing a democratic act and an act which ought to merit their regard. But when I look back to the speeches which we have read during the last three months, and if I am to believe that that is to be the type of oratory which is to be let loose on the country for the next two months, I feel that the people of this country are to be exposed to a very severe test indeed. I do not wish to use any word that may sound unseemly in your Lordships' House, but if there is to be prejudice or inaccuracy&#x2014;I have no doubt noble Lords opposite will apply any stronger term that occurs to them as being in my mind though I should not like to sully the debate by the allusion&#x2014;if the country is to be exposed to any campaign of that sort I own we must face the fact that we have a serious and anxious problem before us.<lb/>
I said at the beginning why, as one of the rank and file of the House, I felt bound to support the Amendment. I do feel that it is our duty to face that fact and do what we believe to be in the best interests of the country and the great principles we have to serve. The noble and learned Lord's caution amounted to this: "If your Lordships will go to sleep and keep quiet the country would not trouble about you but would go on its way." That may be wise as from the point of view of self-preservation, but we have to remember that slumber is not part of the constitutional work which this House is called upon to perform. And, if we are to have any abridgement of our powers, if we are to meet the doom which has been foretold, I, for one, would far rather it was forced upon us than that it came upon us by our own action in deserting our posts and betraying our trusts and enabling those who are opposed to us, not to convince
<col>788</col>
the people, as I gather from what we have heard they are intending to convince them, that the House of Lords is an obstruction to the path of progress, but to make out that we ourselves had given up the position we ought to defend. It does seem to me that it is hardly creditable to the people of this country to suppose that they will be really lashed into indignation by the fact that this House has for six weeks, perhaps even two months, delayed the passing of this measure in order that the people may express their opinion upon it. If they want it, they can then have it; if they do not want it, it will be a proof that we have done well to let them have the opportunity of expressing their opinion. If I may make such a request, I beg the noble Lords opposite to express with full sincerity and earnestness the views they hold, and I do hope they will in justice to the great House to which they belong, at least take care that the issue is put properly and clearly before the people. I do not think they will feel that I am saying anything wrong or unfair if I remind them that there are many in this country who will probably be not overcautious to bring that result about. Whatever they may say about the Finance Bill, and whatever they may say about the House of Lords, I hope we trust to them to take care that the people of the country understand that all we have done this week is to make it clear that this Bill has not become law because we see in it what we believe to be inherent dangers and that we want the people to express their opinion upon it. Every man who gives a vote at this election&#x2014;if an election is to come&#x2014;should understand it is to the House of Lords he owes the opportune and privilege of giving his vote, and to the House of Lords alone he will owe that privilege. I hope I am not appealing in vain to noble Lords opposite. If this is to be a great fight, as we are told, and fought out in all the anxious problems surrounding it, I hope noble Lords on both sides of the House, whatever the issue may be, will see that the battle is fought fairly as between honourable men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03399"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke has dwelt very much upon the subtle arguments of the Lord Chancellor. I venture to think the question for noble Lords opposite is not so much the subtlety
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0401"/>
<col>789</col>
of argument, but the question of the spirit and the custom and tradition of the Constitution. And looking at it from that point of view I cannot help thinking that the noble Lords opposite are probably entering upon a somewhat dangerous course as regards the reputation and position of the House of Lords; and from that point of view I cannot but feel very considerable regret at the line taken by the noble Lord opposite. But there are two questions at issue now apart from the special merits or demerits of the Budget. The first is, of course, the constitutional question which has already been brought forward on various occasions to-night&#x2014;the constitutional question whether in the words of a not very revolutionary Minister, Lord Palmerston, the Commons are to have the direction of the matter, the manner, the measure and the time of taxation. There are so many noble Lords much more qualified than I am to offer an opinion upon that question that I will not trouble your Lordships by dwelling upon it. But I will ask your Lordships to allow me a short time to examine somewhat closely the financial position which the Amendment of the noble Marquess will create. There is no doubt whatever about this, that the action of the noble Marquess practically tends to destroy that equilibrium in our finance which is essential to sound and orderly financial administration. The Amendment refuses not only all new taxation but it refuses to renew the Income Tax and the Tea Duties, and it refuses to reduce the Sinking Fund. The refusal of those important points in the Budget, the points which are absolutely necessary to provide ways and means at all adequate to meet the necessities of the time, makes the financial situation extremely difficult. I have observed that <i>The Times</i> speaks of that difficulty as somewhat laughable. I cannot help thinking that so powerful an authority as <i>The Times</i> has shown a certain levity in so dealing with this question. One thing I feel certain of, and that is that the common sense of the nation will repudiate such a view as that, and will at all events admit that the situation is grave.<lb/>
On another point also I am quite certain, that all the Chancellors of the Exchequer whom I have served under, from Sir George Cornewall Lewis down to Sir William Harcourt, Conservative and Liberal alike, would have viewed
<col>790</col>
this situation with the utmost apprehension and anxiety. The noble Marquess opposite appeared to think some words of mine had painted the situation in a somewhat lurid light. I am sorry to say it is many years since I first met the noble Marquess in public life. He was serving with Mr. Lowe, and I feel sure that at that time both he and I, in common with our chief, would have felt such a situation as the present full of danger for the future and one which could not fail to excite the greatest anxiety. Will you allow me to enter a little more fully upon the figures of the situation, in order that, if possible, I may make my contention clear? The expenditure of the year is practically &#x00A3;164,819,000. That expenditure includes the Sinking Fund because as I have said the Amendment of the noble Marquess prevents the reduction of the Sinking Fund. It now is in full course and the last Exchequer accounts published show that up to date the expenditure is very largely in excess of the expenditure of last year at the same date. And anybody with Treasury experience knows when once the programme of the year is settled, when once the Services are being carried out as arranged, economy or saving of any note is impracticable. Therefore, I feel sure your Lordships may rely upon the fact that the expenditure of the year will be very little short of the sum I have named, especially as we have not yet got the ordinary Supplementary Estimates of March, which will rather tend to increase, certainly not to diminish, the sum that I have named.<lb/>
When we come to revenue we are thrown back, by the Amendment of the noble Marquess, upon the taxation in force on the 31st of March last. That taxation would have raised a revenue of &#x00A3;148,390,000 but since that time, on the 5th of April, the Income Tax expired and on the 1st of July the Tea Duties expired. If you take away from the revenue of &#x00A3;148,000,000 the produce of those two Duties, &#x00A3;33,400,000, it leaves you with an income for the current year of &#x00A3;114,990,000. I will add something for increase upon the ordinary income of the year: say it would probably add a million. That makes &#x00A3;115,990,000. You are thus face to face with this result, that you will have an income of &#x00A3;116,000,000 and an expenditure of &#x00A3;165,000,000. The difference between these two sums implies a very grave deficit&#x2014;a deficit the like of which, I suppose,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0402"/>
<col>791</col>
we shall never find a parallel for in time of peace. It is almost as large as the deficit that occurred in the two years expenditure on the South African war, and as far as peace is concerned I think I may say never has a peace deficit amounted to more than about &#x00A3;3,000,000. The Budget which the House of Lords hands back to the Commons consists of the figures I have named, and I do not think they can be modified to any extent. Different authorities have made their calculations independently of each other and it is worthy of note that all the calculations approach very closely to that sum. There may of course be a difference of a few hundred thousand pounds, but nothing to affect materially the position I have placed before your Lordships.<lb/>
But if that is the case, what is the actual situation? Your Lordships hand back that Budget to the Commons. You are from that moment quite powerless. The House of Lords cannot reduce the expenditure by a penny. You cannot add a penny to the taxation, and therefore as far as you are concerned you must face the deficit, subject always to what the noble Duke placed before us, namely, a General Election taking place. You may have a new House of Commons in February and perhaps they may give you a Budget more in accordance with the wishes of noble Lords opposite. But that does not touch the question of the gravity of the financial situation very closely. The fact of a new House of Commons meeting in February leaves only a few weeks in which to undertake the grave task of a total re-constitution of our financial system. Any measures which are taken can only be <i>ad interim</i> measures. In the meantime, though the noble Marquess made light of it, the tea will be brought in free of duty, thereby affecting not only the revenue of this year but next year. Anybody who has been at all familiar with the collection of taxes knows that when the machinery of collection is out of gear it means a very long delay in realisation of revenue. The consequence is that even if a House of Commons is returned in accordance with the opinions which prevail opposite, the modification they can make in the current year will be comparatively small. There can be a reduction of the deficit of which I have spoken. For instance, the new House can reduce the Sinking Fund; but it is not a very material
<col>792</col>
alteration in the deficit. That deficit has to be met from week to week and month to month but the expenditure progresses. The Appropriation Act gives the Treasury power to borrow that money, but it attaches to it the condition that the money so borrowed must be repaid in the following quarter. That very much encumbers the power of the Treasury in the matter. The borrowed money must be drawn from the money market, and I need hardly say the deficit, whether it be twenty-five, thirty-five or forty-five millions is a heavy strain on the money market at any time. That is the position in which you stand.<lb/>
But I think the noble Marquess made I somewhat of an appeal to the present House of Commons that they might remedy the situation. Well, you are going this week to war with the House of Commons. Can it be fairly anticipated that that House will come to the rescue? Is it not more probable that any measures which they propose for averting the very great evil of such a deficit will be hardly more in accordance with your Lordships' views than those which you are now proceeding to reject? I venture to put it to your Lordships, therefore, that it is very improbable that any measures passed by the present House of Commons will be such as your Lordships will desire, and you may even find yourselves in the position of having to accept such measures as I speak of, or having to face the deficit of that immense amount I quoted. I don't know what your Lordships think but I do not believe that this country is fond of deficits, especially deficits in time of peace, and perhaps it may be deserving of consideration whether an appeal to the country in face of such a deficit would really put your Lordships in a favourable position for maintaining the questionable right of your interference with the finance as laid down by the House of Commons. I am a very old public servant, and one lesson I learned more than fifty years ago when in the Treasury. It was the continuous policy that guided both Conservative and Liberal Governments&#x2014;a continuous policy at all events in time of peace&#x2014;that the ways and means of the year, the taxation of the year, should cover the expenditure. That has been a canon of our finance which has never been departed from, I am afraid I must say until the present occasion. I believe that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0403"/>
<col>793</col>
that has established the English Treasury in the position of supremacy which it certainly holds among all the financial departments of the world. I cannot but feel very great regret that so sound a principle of financial government such as that which I have described should be now set aside and that in the full time of peace the House of Lords should adopt a policy that lands us in a very great deficit.<lb/>
Nor does the difficulty end with this year. Next year, we know already, the expenditure will be very heavy. It will be difficult to make the proposed taxation meet the demands of next year. It is hardly possible to suppose that extra taxation can be also added to cover the deficit which is handed aver from this year to the next. That would involve such a very large amount of taxation that I think scarcely any Government would face it. Your Lordships could be able, without taking so strong a measure as that which you are contemplating, to obtain in the ordinary course of the Parliamentary elections and within a year or two the verdict of the country upon the Budget. If the Budget is unpopular there is no doubt what the verdict will be, and you will then be placed in the position which you are now going to force upon the country. I am afraid the House and the noble Lords opposite have forgotten that most striking letter which the great Duke of Wellington wrote to Lord Derby at the time when he was resigning the leadership of this House on the question of the repeal of the Corn Laws. I will ask the House to allow me to read one extract from that letter which I think is full of wisdom and which applies to all time. The great Duke wrote: "For many years I have endeavoured to manage the House of Lords upon the principles upon which I conceive that the institution exists in the Constitution of the country, that of Conservatism. I have invariably objected to all violent and extreme measures and I have always used my personal influence to prevent the mischief of anything like a difference or division between the two Houses. On the question now before the House (that was the repeal of the Corn Laws) I propose to endeavour to induce them to avoid involving the country in the constitutional difficulties of a difference of opinion between the two Houses on a question on which it has been frequently asserted that their Lordships had a personal
<col>794</col>
interest, which assertion, however false as affecting each of them personally, could not be denied as affecting the proprietors of land in general." I venture to think that those words coming from so high an authority convey a wisdom which I am afraid at the present moment does not find very great favour with noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03400"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REVELSTOKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with extreme diffidence that I rise to address your Lordships, and this is not only the diffidence of a speaker who addresses your Lordships for the first time, and to whom a large measure of indulgence is invariably accorded, but to it is added the consciousness that I am venturing on a subject of extraordinary importance to the people of this country, and in its nature extremely difficult to handle. It has been my lot to have been brought up in the midst of financial and commercial operations, in the conduct and consideration of which I have endeavoured to follow the traditions and to be guided by the experience of many generations of financiers in my own family, whose success in life has been due to their intimate connection with banking and commerce, and whose prosperity, or the reverse, has for many years been bound up with the financial position of the City of London, the home and centre of that great system of "credit" upon which so much depends. It is with the hope that even my comparatively short practical experience of these matters may not be without interest to your Lordships that I venture to rise to-day. Others far more competent than I will no doubt be dealing with various general features and specific clauses of this Bill. I shall therefore confine myself to dealing briefly, and I hope practically, with some of the reasons why, in the opinion of very many, the present measure constitutes a menace to the financial interests of this country.<lb/>
As your Lordships may be aware, the Finance Bill now before us has been the occasion of considerable disturbance in financial circles, and has formed the subject of a memorial of protest to the Prime Minister from business men and merchants in the City of London&#x2014;a memorial of a non-political character, and containing numerous and distinguished signatures. In that document the suggestion has been conveyed that this Bill penalises capital; impairs, or tends to impair, national
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0404"/>
<col>795</col>
prosperity and public confidence; and threatens to undermine credit. As one, therefore, who, by the necessity of his calling, is compelled to be in daily touch with the quarter whence criticisms of the character I have described chiefly emanate, I recognise that I owe to your Lordships something more definite than vague assertions as to the financial injury likely to be inflicted by these proposals of His Majesty's Government, and I feel that it should be my task, as a business man, to endeavour to summarise the objections of business men, and to explain why this Bill is regarded so gravely in quarters which are at least competent to judge, and which, I believe, are for the most part disinterested and impartial in their criticisms.<lb/>
Here is a Budget which, designed to meet expenditure for great social reforms, places an accumulated burden of higher Income Tax, Super-tax, Death Duties, Land Tax, Stamp Duties, all on one particular class. And surely, my Lords, in this matter of heaping taxation upon the few, a double error is committed. Not only is there a penalising of capital, with its consequent ill-effects upon the whole community; but the force of public opinion&#x2014;the greatest, if not the only check upon extravagant expenditure&#x2014;is weakened, and it is weakened at the moment when it is most urgently required. The official figures published by the Exchequer immediately before the present Budget show the extent to which direct taxation is superseding indirect taxation, in which the whole community shares. From these figures it appears that during the past ten years, out of an increased tax revenue of &#x00A3;17,000,000, the direct taxpayer contributed no less than &#x00A3;13,500,000, or say eighty per cent. In the matter of the high Death Duties we are confessedly living upon capital. The high Income Tax strains our emergency reserves. What would be the position to-morrow if, in some international conflict&#x2014;of which happily there is no sign&#x2014;the Exchequer had to issue large additional sums, with Consols under eighty-three? Why, although, as many of your Lordships know only too well, the requirements of Ireland for further funds in connection with the Land Purchase Scheme are urgent, the Government have not dared to make a public issue even of &#x00A3;5,000,000 since July 1908. Any Budget which may be considered financially unsound must of necessity have an immediate effect upon the City of
<col>796</col>
London, which daily&#x2014;I may say hourly&#x2014;in various ways, and mainly through its quotations of public securities, focusses the judgment of experts, which usually becomes finally the judgment of the entire people, concerning the welfare of the country. If the business affairs of a public company are known to be unsoundly handled, and if retrogression in these affairs is even suspected, the Stock Exchange does not await the announcement of bankruptcy before lowering the value of its stocks. It endeavours to appraise the position then and there by a readjustment of prices. Precisely similar is it, my Lords, with the credit of this country, and all the securities in any way affected by that credit.<lb/>
In the criticisms which have been uttered in financial quarters concerning the trend of our national finances and in the appalling depreciation which has occurred in British stocks, the present Government, to judge from its attitude towards such criticisms and protests, would seem to see some deep-laid schemes of biased and unscrupulous financiers. My Lords, as one in daily touch with these financial quarters, I have to-night to affirm that much&#x2014;not all&#x2014;of the unparalleled depreciation in British credit and British stocks is but the result expressed by the financial barometer of the unsettlement occasioned by a growing lack of confidence as to property of all kinds held in this country; and when I hear or read some of the speeches made, or I might almost more properly say the invective uttered, by responsible Ministers concerning the attitude of the City of London towards the Government's financial proposals, I am reminded of nothing so much as of the mariner who is credited with having destroyed his weather glass because it had the temerity to give warning of a storm.<lb/>
It has been said, and said many times within recent months, that capital is leaving this country to a very serious extent, and I have to testify, from my own practical knowledge, that this is true. One is anxious, however, that this matter of the export of British capital should be fairly stated and should be clearly understood. It must not, of course, be supposed that a very considerable investment of English money in foreign securities necessarily betokens an unsatisfactory condition at home, whereas the very reverse is frequently the case, the circumstances often indicating prosperity at home as already

revealed in overflowing deposits at the banks, and with English stocks forced up to such a high level that other sources of investments have to be sought. As a mutter of fact, my Lords, British securities are to-day abnormally low, and therefore yield themselves a higher rate of interest than has been customary. It seems to me that the vital error is committed of failing to distinguish between British capital being attracted abroad and being driven abroad. There has never, I think, been a period in our financial history when it has been more necessary to make this distinction. There are, and there have been for some years past, great natural forces at work, among which must be included the great commercial activity of other countries, such as the United States and Germany, which make for increasing demands both on the liquid and permanent capital of this country, and while I should certainly be the last man the decry the activities of other countries, still less the demands made upon bankers in the City of London, I am bound to recognise that, if what I will define as the great drawing power of foreign countries is to be supplemented by a great driving force from home, arising from lack of confidence in the English Government, in English securities, and in English enterprises, the position of affairs is undoubtedly grave. The legitimate flow of capital abroad becomes an exodus; something more than a surplus is exported, and abnormally high bank rates, with their penalising effect upon trade, will have to be imposed. The prolonged depreciation in British securities, accompanied as it has been by steadiness or actual appreciation in foreign and American securities, has been too pronounced and too sustained to be entirely accounted for by the ordinary working of economic forces.<lb/>
A recognised index of public securities published monthly by the <i>Bankers' Magazine</i> shows that during the past three years there has been a net depreciation in the capital value of 387 stocks of over 110 millions sterling. British Funds depreciated by no less than 50 millions, or a fall or 6.3 per cent. as compared with three years ago, and in English railways there was a decline of 62 millions sterling, or 10&#x00BD; per cent. I would draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that the total depreciation of 110 millions already referred to was a net depreciation, for daring this same period Foreign Government
<col>798</col>
stocks rose by over 16 millions sterling and American railroads by 21 millions. Since the Budget was produced all leading British stocks have further receded. Four years ago Consols stood at 89&#x215C; and London and North Western Railway stock at 161. To-day Consols are quoted at 82&#x215D;, and London and North Western Stock at 129&#x00BC;. Is it surprising that in view of such figures experts should be asking and the public should be wondering what are the influences operating? This is no sudden and unreasoning panic, I can hear the public say. This is no breakdown of an hysterical speculation. This is a steady and hopeless depreciation of the securities in which the most conservative of us have been brought up to pin our faith.<lb/>
My Lords, the tendencies to which lately expression has been given by Ministers have undermined confidence in British stocks to a degree never yet witnessed by this generation. British stocks have been thrown over in wholesale fashion for foreign securities and new foreign loans; British savings are fleeing from a threatened area to quarters where capital is more warmly welcomed. In almost every deceased estate which has come before my notice, within the past few years the best class of British stocks have been sold almost as a matter of course, and the proceeds have been invested abroad. There is actual evasion&#x2014;and more evasion in prospect&#x2014;on the part of the Income Tax payer, who has hitherto been the most honest, the most docile and tractable of beings. The Income Tax payer has come to the conclusion that he is being harshly and unjustly treated. It is no exaggeration to say that every investor and every broker who comes to me seeking advice as to investment prefaces his conversation by the statement: "I want something abroad." From expert financial quarters sober criticisms were offered at an early stage of the discussion on the Finance Bill, and the fact that they were met not by answering argument, but by invective, has produced an effect upon credit and confidence which it will require years of sound and sober legislation to remove. We have had speech after speech from our legislators of which the purpose has been to set class against class and to represent the interests of capital as antagonistic to the welfare of the people.<lb/>
This is a new doctrine to be preached by a British Administration. It misrepresents
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0406"/>
<col>799</col>
the position of capital as it is understood by all impartial observers removed from the clamour of party politics. It ignores the extent to which the prosperity of this nation has been due to its great capital resources, its heritage of financial supremacy, its unshaken credit. The extreme difficulty of adequately conveying to the originators of this Bill a sense of the harm which it has already occasioned, and is likely to still further occasion, lies largely in the very fact that it seems well nigh impossible to bring home to those responsible a real sense of what is invoved in "unshaken credit." As I have read the speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I can almost hear him ask, like another person better known in history, and like him, without waiting for an answer, not "What is truth?", but "What is credit?" My Lords, I can give him that answer&#x2014;I can give him the answer he would receive from the sober community among whom I have passed my days. They would tell him&#x2014;and they are men whose occupations do not lead them to make speeches, but who have read, and read with dismay, the reckless and unconsidered utterances of even the most responsible members of His Majesty's Government. Those of whom I speak, my Lords, are men whose experience and character, whose probity and judgment, have contributed not a little to make this England of ours what she has been&#x2014;and what she should remain&#x2014;the Bank and the workshop of the world. They would tell him, My Lords, that they define "credit" as "confidence." Confidence in financial prudence, confidence in ability to pay, confidence in financial equity and stability, confidence in the sanctity of property. Can we say, my Lords, that our confidence in any of these would not be shaken by the passing of the measure which is now before your Lordships' House?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03401"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to venture to say a word, in a House where there are so many experts, on the subject of the great and grave constitutional question, with regard to which so many of your Lordships who have a much better right to speak than I have already addressed you, but I suppose there is no one who would not give the most cordial assent to the proposition of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition if he really concurred in the view that the Finance Bill which your Lordships are proposing to refer to the judgment of the
<col>800</col>
country is revolutionary and oppressive. Unless the Bill is a revolutionary and oppressive one this House could not be justified in taking the exceptional step which it proposes to take. It is because I believe that the Government Budget is neither revolutionary nor oppressive that I venture to address your Lordships.<lb/>
I am not proposing to say anything about the suggested alternative method of raising money by what is called Tariff Reform, because I suppose that even those who are the most sanguine believers in the power of Tariff Reform to restore British industries and to open out untold, but at present unknown, sources of national wealth, would recognise that it could not be this year, or next year, or the year after that so momentous a change could have the effect which is hoped from it, and meanwhile the money for our great national expenditure has to be raised. My Lords, that is the point on which I desire to say a few words. I look at society as one who is interested, perhaps, especially in its less fortunate members, but we all know that what in a general phrase we call the social question is really the dominant question of our time, and when from any reasonable point of view you approach the great social question you are confronted with the requirement for an enormously increased national expenditure. About that I presume there would not be much difference of opinion. But might I ask your Lordships to consider only one or two directions in which this greatly increased national expenditure is to be required of us? The most rev. Primate the other day introduced to your Lordships' notice, or rather developed before this House, the great subject of the requirements made upon us by the Reports upon the Poor I Law Administration of our country. He pointed out how grave the indictment of our present system was in both the Reports of the Commission, and how immense and insistent are the calls made upon us for action.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, to take only one subject, the subject of unemployment, what are the remedies that almost all our most careful observers of society tell us that we must undertake and undertake speedily on this intricate subject? In order to check the continual outflow of our youth into the casual labour market to form the material of the unemployed and then of the unemployable, there is the requirement that we
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0407"/>
<col>801</col>
should raise the school age, the age of compulsory attendance, and that with a new system of half-timers we should then have compulsory attendence at evening continuation schools. That will cost money; they must be instituted locally. Again, there is a great necessity that we should have for what are called the unemployable&#x2014;people who are work-shy&#x2014;detention colonies. Then for those who are out of employment without any fault of their own it is necessary that we should have industrial colonies. Again, we have been promised assurance against unemployment. Once again, we have been continually warned against and have felt the extraordinary loss of human life through the employment of mothers in factories, and we need, and need at once, greater assistance for mothers, especially widows. Once again we are faced with the immediate necessity for action with regard to the feeble minded as to their detention and segregation in order to prevent the propagation of a species that ought not to be propagated. Besides all these things my Lords, we know that the limitation with regard to Old Age Pensions in the case of those who receive Poor Law relief lapses automatically in 1911. That means a great further increase in the demand on the national finances for Old Age Pensions; and we are further warned of the necessity for some contributory system which shall supplement the present system.<lb/>
Then again, the greatest of our economists has told us about the peremptory necessity for the provision of further money for open spaces, and I have reason to believe that there is not likely to be any relaxation of the demand either for the Army or for the Navy. Now, my Lords, all these are not things which admit of being deferred to a more or less remote future. They are urgent. They are things that almost all sober-minded observers of our society realise are urgent and agree that the dealing with them means a vast increase of our public expenditure. I think it means that we should revise the kind of expectation with which we of our generation were brought up with regard to the relationship of private and public expenditure and of the kind of demands which are to be made on people's incomes for public expenditure. My Lords, when we were at school and learnt Horace there were the words that we remember, in which Horace described the ideal of Rome in the noble days of old when people expected a narrow private and a large public expenditure
<col>802</col>
&#x2014;<i>Privatus illis census erat brevis, commune magnum</i>&#x2014;what was private was small, what was common was great. I prefer to look for my ideal in the future and not in the past, and I am quite sure that if we are to look forward to a gradual improvement in our existing social conditions it must be through an immense increase of public expenditure on matters beneficial to the present state of society. The noble Lord who has just sat down, Lord Revel-stoke, spoke of that sober company of capitalists among whom he had been brought up, and of the distress and anxiety with which they viewed the present situation. But, my Lords, we must not forget that there are also other sober classes of society. I think it is quite impossible to consider the state of mind of the vast body of the workers without realising that there settles down upon almost all of them at a miserably early stage of their lives a sense of depression and hopelessness that they have not any real prospect of bettering their position, and as if they had got into a rut along which they would have to move all the rest of their lives until they die. If any kind of depression is to settle down upon the upper <i>strata</i> of society, if they are to contemplate less buoyant times for themselves, I think it is true that the industrial condition of the country would on the whole not be worse but would be better if simultaneously there were to settle down on the great body of the working classes the sense that their country was going to be a better place for them to live in in the future than it has been in the past.<lb/>
It is impossible to live in one of our great cities without becoming conscious of the fact that for the great body of the workers our country is not a good place to live in at the present moment. As I have shown your Lordships, there is a great, vast, and growing demand for money for public expenditure. How is that money which is required to be obtained? The question is whether in this Budget there is an unjust and oppressive treatment of particular classes, especially of the landed classes and of those who are engaged in the liquor trade. I do not know whether that is the case. With regard to the matter which has been, I suppose, most commented on of all the land taxes&#x2014;that is, the tax upon the unearned increment on land in and about towns&#x2014;those of us who have been taught the political economy of John Stuart Mill have been expecting to see this tax in England for a great many years. I wonder
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0408"/>
<col>803</col>
if your Lordships have all seen a notice which appeared in the newspapers last week. I happened to read it in a newspaper of a Conservative or Unionist colour, and it did not appear to me that it was as much noticed as might have been expected from the important information it conveyed. It is headed "Unearned Increment," and from the report it appears with regard to the great city of Berlin&#x2014;I now read the words&#x2014;
<quote>"Faced with the urgent necessity of tapping new sources of taxation, the Executive officials of the Berlin municipality have decided that the Imperial capital must follow the lead of other German cities, and resort to the taxation of unearned increment. The City Fathers have taken as their exemplar the town of Hamburg, and the scheme submitted to the Municipal Council is based upon the increment Value Tax in force in the great North Sea Port."</quote>
Your Lordships know, of course, that in the great cities in Germany they have a power of taxation of their own in this respect, and within the last seven years this is the thirteenth or the fourteenth of the great German cities which have resorted to this tax on unearned increment, and for my own part I must say that I can conceive no kind of tax which is more just or more necessary.<lb/>
Again, dealing with the increased taxes upon licences, we cannot conceal from ourselves that an increased taxation upon licences has been threatened for a great number of years. For my own part, I never have been able to doubt that there was any matter on which the country was more gratuitously giving away what it ought not to give away without adequate return to itself than in the matter of the cheapness of licences. Even if it were the case that there would be an undue pressure placed on certain interests by the Budget, I should still think that a future Government, more favourably considered by the majority of your Lordships' House than the present Government, might reasonably rectify that undue pressure on one or two interests by raising the pressure on other interests to the same level, because I am certain that it is only by raising the pressure on all classes of the community that we shall be able to obtain the increased amount of money that we shall require for our national expenditure. It was said in the course of this debate before dinner that the Budget is Socialism. Of course you can use the terms Conservatism, Liberalism and Socialism in such a way as
<col>804</col>
to make them apply to almost anything you like. Socialism is a term which I think it is best to employ as a quite distinctive term representing a quite distinctive view, and a view which no doubt is gaining in its hold especially on the working classes throughout Europe. I do not hold with the Socialistic theory myself, but I know what it means. It means the abolition of private capital, not private property, and the socialisation of the sources and instruments of production and distribution. In the sense in which Collectivists use the word Socialism, this Budget is not in any way Socialistic. It does not propose in any kind of way or point to the transfer to the community of the sources and instruments of production and distribution, although it might be said that it moves towards it. I venture to think that the most reactionary Budget, the Budget which moves most sharply in the opposite direction, would be the Budget which would be most likely to lead rapidly to Socialism by stirring up the already moving minds of the people to rebellion and revolt against the injustice of our present industrial conditions.<lb/>
More than that, my Lords, this Budget does not go to the point to which so many German economists are pressing, of using taxation as a means of altogether redistributing the proceeds of industry. There are many of us who believe that in the past epoch there has been a gross inequality and injustice in the distribution of the proceeds of industry as between capital and labour, that capital has had too much and labour too little, and there is a school, of German economists especially, who say that taxation is the true means of redistributing the proceeds of industry in a more just and equitable manner by taxing the rich, for public works particularly, for the benefit of the poor. I should entirely assent to that proposition for my own part, but it does not seem to me that the Budget goes as far as that. It does not seem to me to do more than attempt to equalise the pressure of public burdens as between one class and another The question of the exact relative pressure of rates and taxes upon rich and poor involves some calculations which are complex and are very difficult, because at first sight one might say that the pressure of the rates upon the artisan is enormously greater than the pressure of the rates upon the wealthy man. But you have to take into account how much of that rate actually comes back to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0409"/>
<col>805</col>
him. For example, the education rate may be regarded as what he himself pays for the education of his own children. So no doubt the matter is a complicated one, and I do not wish to conceal the complications of rating. But it does seem to me in practical experience that when one takes oneself, or any one of the well-to-do classes, and compares the pressure of the burden of taxation and rating upon oneself with the pressure of that burden upon an artisan who, out of his wages of 30<i>s</i>. a week, has to pay perhaps 1<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in rates, indirectly, of course, as part of the 6<i>s</i>. or 7<i>s</i>. rent which he pays for his house, and when side by side with that you have the fact that he pays indirectly upon those special comforts or necessities of life such as his sugar and his tea, and upon his luxuries such as his beer, his spirits, and his tobacco, and that he is going to pay more for his beer and his spirits and his tobacco&#x2014;right luxuries or wrong luxuries as they may be, but in fact his luxuries&#x2014;through this Budget, I do not believe that the Budget can be said to do more than to move some way towards the equalisation of the burden of taxation upon the rich and upon the poor.<lb/>
My Lords, I come back to the main point which I desire to press upon this House, if I might be allowed to do it. It is that we are to expect a great and continual increase in the amount of public expenditure, and that with regard to this we cannot wait for any prospective and uncertain produce of Tariff Reform. At any rate, if there is to be such produce from Tariff Reform, then it will be time enough when that produce is realised and is with us to use it for the rectifying or alleviating of taxation in other directions. Meanwhile, we have to provide for this year and next year and the year after that, and these great social requirements cannot wait, there is great urgency for them. Therefore, my Lords, in view of this increased necessity for public expenditure I desire to contend and to bear witness that it seems to me that this Budget is not more than an attempt to go in the right direction in meeting this increased demand for national expenditure, and that it lays the burden as far as human wits can devise equally and fairly and equitably upon all classes. There is amongst us, not very highly developed, a revolutionary spirit in the country, and I cannot feel that it is only that small revolutionary spirit that will rejoice if your Lordships accept
<col>806</col>
the Amendment of the noble Marquess. We have heard the story of the mariner who destroyed his barometer because he was angry with it for prognosticating stormy weather. I could not help feeling when I heard that story that it admitted of an application in more directions than one. I certainly have been enormously struck, going about among men, with the number of persons whose Unionist or Conservative principles are certainly not to be disputed, who are greatly dismayed at the proposal they find in the papers supported by the majority of your Lordships' House. We have already heard it said that the method of progress in England was by slowly broadening out from precedent to precedent. It seems to me that this Budget is only one more example of the broadening out from precedent to precedent such as the one set by the institution of the scale of Death Duties years ago by Sir William Harcourt. The Budget is only one more instance of the gradual growth towards a more proper distribution of the constantly-increasing burdens of public expenditure, broadening out from precedent to precedent, and I cannot but feel that your Lordships will indeed not be acting wisely if you treat this Budget as if it could be accused of containing either revolutionary or unjust principles.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03402"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have only three things to say. The first is that if I could believe that this Budget would do anything to relieve the poverty of the poor, or to remedy the great inequalities of wealth, if I thought it would help unemployment and the crying evils that arise from overcrowding and the social state of our great towns, I should be the first to vote for it. It is because, so far as I am able to understand the matter, I am convinced that far from remedying those evils it will only aggravate them, that I support with all my heart the Amendment of the noble Marquess. The second thing I wish to say is that I think the country would never forgive your Lordships' House, and rightly so, if, in view of the great interests which are at stake, interests which affect not one class but all classes of the community, your Lordships from any fear of the consequences to yourselves refused to give the country the opportunity of deciding upon these issues What will be the position of your Lordships' House if this Budget is passed
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0410"/>
<col>807</col>
unchallenged by your Lordships, and the seeds of evil which it contains develop and produce their unhappy fruit? What answer will your Lordships make to the country if the country says to this House, as assuredly it would say, "You, as the Second Chamber, had the opportunity of giving us the chance of considering this matter for ourselves, and from some selfish consideration, from some unworthy fear, you have abdicated your duty and left what you thought and knew to be a measure fraught with evil to this country to pass unchallenged." My Lords, I am convinced, in the face of such an accusation as that, there is nothing else that could be said, except that a Chamber which had so abdicated its duty was one which was not worthy of its position. My last word is this. I am certain that this House can run no greater danger than to act in such a way as would forfeit its own self-respect and the respect of those who throughout the length and breadth of the country&#x2014;and they will be found in all classes&#x2014;look to this House to defend them from hasty and ill-considered legislation, and to your Lordships, when the occasion is forced upon you, to give them a straight and courageous lead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03403"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to address a few words to the House on this vexed question, speaking, to borrow an expression of the noble Duke's opposite, as one of the rank and file of your Lordships' House. Perhaps it is only fair to add that I also speak as an unrelenting Free Trader. I will begin by trying to state my main position as regards the business before us to-night as concisely as the noble Viscount opposite, though perhaps I shall state that position in a less heroic mould than he has chosen. I dissent altogether from Lord Lansdowne's Amendment in that it forces a Dissolution by reason of your Lordships' refusal to grant Supplies. I am sure we all must have admired the way in which the noble Marquess struggled with a very bad cold, but I do not think anybody missed a word of what he said. He told us that the extinction of this measure was not desired. Well, my Lords, it may not be desired, but surely its extinction is involved and intended in the Amendment we are considering to-night. I know very well that the action which the noble Marquess and his friends are recommending to your
<col>808</col>
Lordships is pavilioned by every splendour and girded with every phrase known to leader writers on party questions and to protest speakers on party platforms and a good deal of eloquent advocacy of this sort has played some part in this debate. Some of it fell just now from the noble Marquess opposite, but it has not blinded my political vision, and I do not know that it has altogether blinded that of the noble Marquess himself, or that he is really very much consoled by the assurances he has received in this purple and gold language from his supporters in <i>The Times</i> and other newspapers, and I still believe that the noble Marquess is a Whig just as I also believe that Mr. Balfour is at heart a Free Trader.<lb/>
Be that as it may, when I hear these sonorous phrases used by noble Lords opposite about the democratic and constitutional principles which animate them and which dignify the Amendment and decorate the action which your Lordships are proposing to take, I really am inclined to rub my eyes and wonder where we have all got to. I think it was one of Coleridge's friends, who, when Coleridge took to dissertations and written arguments on theology, declared that it must be "only his fun," and I think when I begin to see this very crude proposal dressed up in this elaborate language that it can be "only the fun" of the people who put this sort of thing forward. On the other hand, I recognise that given a certain degree of novelty in any legislative proposal, whether financial or otherwise, an appeal to the commons of England is a very captivating bait to hold out. The question is whether the point of novelty at which it is right for the House of Lords to do that sort of thing has been reached in this present Budget, and whether this advice is being given and this object is being achieved in the most expedient and proper way. I do not know that this summary of mine amounts to much. It is rather like the battle between the Lord Chancellor and the ex-Lord Chancellor. The noble Marquess and his friends say that it is being done in the proper way. I say and I believe most noble Lords on this side say, that it is not being done in the proper way. So there we are&#x0021; But putting that on one side, I cannot bring myself to see or even imagine the moral disintegration which under the Budget provisions is impending in the dismal vision of Ezekiel
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0411"/>
<col>809</col>
which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches unfolded when he addressed a company of commercial gentlemen in Glasgow, and which its passage into law would involve. Granting, as I believe everybody does, that in all large measures of taxation there will be cases of hardship and of inconvenience and of cumbersome administration, or even inquisitorial administration&#x2014;and a great deal that is disagreeable and repugnant to most Englishmen is to be found in this Budget&#x2014;yet seeing the great and urgent need of the large sum of money which is required for public expenditure, are we not all rather losing our sense of proportion and of perspective in objecting to the Budget as a financial arrangement for meeting what are not denied to be those very urgent needs and requirements? Is the Budget, after all, so very much out of hang and out of keeping with those needs?<lb/>
We all know that there is a very great deal of money wanted and that there is a very large deficit; and not only that, the Bishop of Birmingham has referred to the Poor Law Report and to the need of money in that direction. I also remember that although all this money is wanted, and admittedly wanted, for these purposes, yet noble Lords opposite and their friends in the country and a great many people the friends of those who sit on this side of the House are urging the Government to spend even more money on our public services. Therefore, my Lords, I think it comes with rather a bad grace from that side of the House, who are always urging us to spend more money, to take this course of checking Supplies. The Bishop of Birmingham referred to the alternative. He said he did not think that Tariff Reform could be engineered sufficiently quickly to help us very much if that is to be the alternative. My Lords, I am quite of that opinion. I am not such an out-and-out believer in representation as some people, and I think if we could give Lord Milner and Lord Cromer and Lord Faber and Lord Revelstoke&#x2014;who I am sure we can congratulate on the very able speech he made to-night&#x2014;and others of that kidney, which we are not, of course, able to do, a free hand to develop a scientific Tariff Reform they no doubt might with time and care collect money which would meet our needs. But granting that there is this great reservoir of money, which I very much doubt, ready to flow in to us from the foreigner, no one will pretend that the pipes and the mains of this
<col>810</col>
reservoir, as it were, are at present laid on to our national needs. I do not believe that even Lord Ridley himself would pretend that for one moment.<lb/>
My Lords, we have all been very much upset&#x2014;I have myself&#x2014;by the speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I have been able to get over them, and I have no doubt noble Lords opposite have also. But there is one thing I will say for Mr. Lloyd-George, and that is that he has stuck to his form throughout. If you take Limehouse as his Ossa, he backed it up with Pelion in the shape of Newcastle. I rather respect him for that, because there is no sort of doubt that, if any speaker starts on a half-pantaloon and half-highwayman style it is almost too much to ask him, all of a sudden, to turn round and revert to the manner of our classical models, such as the late Mr. Gladstone, the late Lord Goschen, and the present Lord St. Aldwyn. But whatever may have been the infelicity of the style which has recommended the Budget, I am bound to say that the first attacks on it were some-what infelicitous too and it is an infelicity which we have all, somehow or another, learned to connect with the word "Duke." Personally I think Dukes are charming people, but I am bound to say that I have read a good many speeches of Dukes from time to time, and they have stuck to their form too. Their speeches remind me of Tennyson's line, "Tears, Idle Tears," and I cannot help thinking that no one will be very seriously affected by the sobs of quite well-to-do folk.<lb/>
Now I pass from the speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and of the Dukes to one or two provisions of the Budget. I noticed that at Glasgow Lord Rosebery absolved himself from going into any details out of constitutional deference to his holding a Peerage. I shall follow his example, and the little I have to say about Budget provisions I shall treat very generally. The Bishop of Birmingham just now quoted Horace. I had the honour of being in the same house at Harrow with the Bishop of Birmingham, and I must give him a bit of Horace back. Lord Lansdowne in his speech drew rather a gloomy picture of the future of all landowners owing to the spirit which the noble Marquess imagines animates Liberal policy towards that particular class. Our old friend <i>Beatus ille qui procul negotiis</i>, who lives on and looks after
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0412"/>
<col>811</col>
his land is to have a bad time of it. I am bound to say that Mr. Lloyd-George has done something for us. Noble Lords opposite and their Party in the other House, claim, I believe, to represent especially those interested in land; but, after all, it is only through Mr. Lloyd-George that it has at last been recognised that for the purposes of Income Tax we are to come under Schedule D. [Cries of "No."] Well, not in words but in effect, and people who keep their estate accounts so carefully as Lord Hindlip, who actually recently invited a hostile investigation into them, will find themselves in a better position than they were before. [Laughter.] I honestly believe that; it is not a laughing matter. Then we have also had the Development Bill, an amiable and cherishing measure not of first class importance, but intended, I believe, to help the poor country gentleman. I am sorry that the Death Duties are to be increased, and there I associate myself most cordially with what the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, has said, and with what has fallen from other noble Lords. I do not know whether the steepening of the Death Duties has been put on as a sort of guard in case these contemplated taxes do not flow in with the fertility which is expected of them, but anyhow this is a serious matter. Lord Revelstoke took a gloomy view of the finance under a Liberal Government. His view reminds me of the Tory foxhunter who said that there had been no fine weather since the Stuarts left. But I sometimes go into the City, and the other day I was told by the leading partner of a very large firm of accountants that 225 millions had been, altogether absorbed in Death Duties and that that had reduced the national income by &#x00A3;6,750,000 a year. Some of that, of course, must be capital withdrawn from activity in productive enterprises, and I think that all Lord Revelstoke said about this was well founded. Steepened Death Duties, once in force, are not likely to be remitted whichever Party is in office. All Governments are extravagant and they like lots of money with which to be extravagant. Take for instance the Chancellor of the Exchequer's peroration to his speech the other night with regard to his own Bill. I confess I did not find that peroration very reassuring. The right hon. gentleman said that his Budget was to wage an implacable war at other people's expense for all kinds of undefined social objects. That is what the Bishop of Birmingham
<col>812</col>
was so pleased with. I still hope something will be done in future to try and bring our Budgets back to the test set up by Mr. Gladstone that the budgeting for the year ought to belong to the year only, that Parliament should know what we are going to spend the money upon, and that it should not be spent upon all kinds of ulterior social objects however desirable or very possibly necessary. Of course I see this Budget has been very I much blamed because of the selection of one class of property for taxation. I followed the debates carefully in the House of Commons and that always seems to be the frontal attack on the Budget from which every sort of misadventure is to flow, to create unemployment, insecurity, disaster I to the family, and goodness knows what. But surely in private affairs we all do differentiate between classes of property. No one would say that a man who owned growing timber or wooden ships, or a valuable brood mare, or a diamond would look upon them as all being exactly the same property when he came to deal with them. Then why in the world should we apply a different reasoning to public affairs from what we all should in our private affairs? I am afraid that directly you get away from direct sources of taxation such as the Income Tax into these very ingenious sources of taxation (whether this kind of Budget is good or not I do not stop to inquire) these differentiations are inevitable. My Lords, there are other points in this Budget, which I quite agree is of a "multifarious" character; they will, no doubt, be commented on by other speakers and I will leave them in order to put before the House one or two considerations apart from party politics. Let us imagine that the floor of this House no longer divides us. Let us imagine that we are merely a number of educated men of business, considering business arrangements and discussing them by the light of our existing needs and conditions. Looking at it in that way, is this such a very bad Budget? I know that some people say it is Socialistic and we have heard a good deal from the Bishop of Birmingham as to the definition of Socialism. I confess I have not been able to discover anything Socialistic in it, though I agree that Socialism is a disagreeable word and speaks with a diversity of tongues, all of which are apt to be uncomfortable and alarming. I do not see in the Budget anything like the redistribution of wealth or the nationalisation of all the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0413"/>
<col>813</col>
raw material of production which I believe was the broad definition of the Socialist fiscal policy which was laid down in a memorandum by Mr. Snowden just before the Socialist Conference at Portsmouth about a year ago. It is for this reason, and because as I said at the beginning of my speech I dissent from the House of Lords forcing a Dissolution upon this or any Government upon the question of Supply&#x2014;I do not for a moment question your constitutional and technical rights to do it, although I do question the constitutional expediency and the constitutional propriety of this course&#x2014;that if this debate comes to a Division my vote will be at the service of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03404"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I may be excused for saying a few words on a Budget which so seriously affects every trade and every industry in the country. Up to the present, however strong a partisan the Chancellor of the Exchequer may have been, he has put aside political feeling when dealing with the Budget and only had regard to the raising of the necessary revenue upon just and equitable lines. But upon what grounds Mr. Lloyd-George has based the justice and financial wisdom of many of his taxes it is very difficult to ascertain. For although he has informed us that there never was a Budget so well and so carefully considered by the Cabinet as this Budget, yet nevertheless it has undergone so many changes in its passage through the House of Commons that really in many respects it bears but little resemblance to its first edition. These changes have not been mere, changes of details, but changes of considerable magnitude and principle.<lb/>
Let us take the tax on ungotten minerals. The object of that tax was to force landowners to develop the minerals beneath their land. That has gone, and its place has been taken by a tax on mining royalties. Now it is not the man who refuses to develop his minerals who is taxed; it is the man who develops his minerals, the man who encourages industry and employment. If the people approve of the principle of a tax on ungotten minerals, how can they approve of a tax which is utterly opposed in principle, and which will eventually produce an entirely different result? The Government's justification for this tax on mineral royalties is that the receiver of the royalties
<col>814</col>
sits idly by and does nothing to earn his income. But in that case, why do they tax the mine-owner who develops his minerals? He does not sit idly by and do nothing. He puts his energy, his capital, and his enterprise into his business. In his case no mining royalty exists, but the Government, not to be done out of their money, actually proceed to create a fictitious royalty on which they base their tax. It really does seem an extraordinary step for ths Government to take, while attacking the system of mining royalties, now instead of doing away with them they extend that system to those mines where no royalty previously existed. Besides if the Government wish to tax those whom they consider to be enjoying incomes for which they do no work, surely there are other forms of income which come tinder the same category.<lb/>
For instance, take stocks and shares. The shareholder draws his dividends and enjoys an income from his shares for which he does no work. His stocks may increase in value, but the Government do not tax that increment, neither do they put a special tax on the income he receives from his dividends. On what grounds do the Government draw this distinction between incomes derived from stocks and shares and incomes derived from minerals? There is no difference between the two. The Socialists are far more logical; they approve of the tax on mining royalties and on the increment of land, because such taxes are the first step towards their general proposal to-tax increment on all kinds of property. They see no difference between an increment in land and increment in stocks and shares; indeed, one awaits with considerable interest some Government speaker who will conclusively prove that there is between these two forms of increment so much difference as to make it just to tax the one and not the other. The principle is quite a new one in our finance, and it involves possibilities of considerable extention in the future. Indeed, in the House of Commons Mr. Chiozza Money asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he would consider the advisability of extending increment duty to other forms of property besides land and minerals. Mr. Hobhouse, answering for Mr. Lloyd-George, stated that the proposals had been placed before the Chancellor of the Exchequer for his consideration; and yet the Government maintain that the first step on this path shall be taken without any
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0414"/>
<col>815</col>
attempt being made to obtain the expressed opinion of the country.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, this tax operates in Scotland in a very different manner from what it does in England. This tax on mineral royalties was originally based on the assumption that royalty owners contributed nothing towards local burdens. Perhaps your Lordships will permit me to quote the Chancellor of the Exchequer's own words on this subject from his Newcastle speech. Talking of the mineral owners, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They charge for the minerals; they charge for the surface whenever land is wanted for waterworks, and they charge heavy prices for it. Railways have to pay; and between all these charges industry is burdened and the landlords do not contribute one penny towards the heavy and growing rates of the district."</quote>
Now, my Lords, what is the truth as to this contribution. There is a very large mining industry in Scotland of sufficient importance I should have thought for Mr. Lloyd-George to have ascertained the different conditions appertaining to it. The mineral owners in Scotland <i>are</i> subject to local rates. They already pay their full contribution towards the local burdens, it would not be merely a hardship it would be a gross injustice if they were made to pay the same proportion of their income from royalties as their English neighbours who are not called upon to contribute anything directly to local taxation.<lb/>
An Amendment was moved in the House of Commons to remedy this, but Mr. Lloyd-George declined to accept it. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It would be a very serious principle for the Government in establishing a new tax to take into account the rates paid by the property taxed."</quote>
But, my Lords, it was on the erroneous assumption that these people paid no rates that Mr. Lloyd-George proposed this tax, yet now he turns round and says he cannot take into account the rates paid by the property taxed. As a Scottish Peer, I think Scotland is entitled to an answer on this point of unequal taxation, and I beg to ask the Government to give me that answer in this House. On financial grounds it is difficult to justify this tax as it is a tax not on income but on capital. The life of these mines is limited. Out of the income which the owner receives he has to provide a sinking fund. Therefore, the nominal income derived from royalties is a very different one from that which
<col>816</col>
a man enjoys who has his capital invested in Consols. I can quote one instance out of probably many similar instances, of a mine with an extremely short life, whose capital value is under &#x00A3;20,000, the royalties of which constitute over three-fourths of the owner's income, and yet if the Budget proposals were put into operation that man would have to pay local rates, Income Tax, this new Mineral Tax, Super Tax, and the insurance premiums to meet the Death Duties. Surely it is quite evident that the cumulative effect of these taxes would be to deprive that man of a very large part of his capital. But the <i>most</i> serious objection to this tax is that sooner or later, when the old agreements fall in and new agreements are made, the tax will be transferred to the consumer. That this has been recognised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is quite evident, otherwise why did he exempt from the new duty such articles as clay and lime? They were exempted, because to tax them would be to penalise the production of the articles of which they form the raw material. The same therefore must be true of our steel trade and all industries dependent on coal and iron.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, anyone who studies the speeches that have been made in the country in defence of this Budget, will find that nearly all the time and nearly all the discussions have been given to land taxes, although these are negligible as regards realising the revenue necessary to meet the deficit. But, when we look to the financial side of the Budget, we see, to begin with that Mr. Lloyd-George has utterly failed to find all the money required to meet the deficit from the revenue. He has been compelled to fall back upon the Sinking Fund. To the extent of &#x00A3;3,500,000 he raids that Fund, and yet the Government want us to believe that their Free Trade finance has not failed&#x0021; Already many financiers whose politics are those of the Government have expressed strong disapproval of Mr. Lloyd-George's heavy taxes on capital.<lb/>
I think the opinions expressed by Sir Felix Schuster in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> deserve consideration although the Government ignore them. Referring to the Death Duties he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I cannot but come to the conclusion that if the proposed scale of Death Duties is carried through, it will lead to a gradual but steady diminution of capital. &#x2026; The disturbance
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0415"/>
<col>817</col>
to trade caused by the withdrawal of such a large proportion of working capital must not be overlooked &#x2026; It is no light matter for a business or factory with a capital of say &#x00A3;500,000 to suddenly submit to a loss of &#x00A3;65,000. &#x2026; A reduction of trade and employment must inevitably follow &#x2026;."</quote>
Now, my Lords, this is a very serious indictment. At a time when competition of every kind grows keener and unemployment daily becomes a graver problem, we are not only asked to tax coal and iron, the raw materials of our industries, but we are to pay the current expenses of the State out of the capital on which our industries depend for their existence and expansion.<lb/>
If we examine the leading States of Europe, France, Germany, Italy, nowhere do we find a precedent for such heavy taxation of capital, taxation which directly penalises thrift and industry and places a premium on idleness and extravagance. But there are other precedents and other methods of taxation which we consider will provide a better way of meeting the financial necessities of the country. Surely the country ought to be allowed to have a voice in its future when such men as Sir Felix Schuster, Lord Joicey and Sir Robert Perks, to name only a few of the Government side, express feelings of grave apprehension as to the country's welfare. If the Budget proposals are to be put into operation, surely it is not too much to ask that their opinions shall be compared with the Government's opinions and the verdict of the country be obtained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03405"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LEITH OF FYVIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to confirm what has been said by my noble friend who last addressed the House as to the policy of the Government. In my view the proposals relating to the taxation of minerals are most extraordinary because of their inconsistency. They are inconsistent not only with regard to the very hard working community of quarry owners and workers among themselves, but there is the further inconsistency that the granite quarry workers (lessees) have to pay rates in Scotland, whereas in England they do not have to pay rates; whether or not the quarries in Scotland are worked they have to pay. There is also the inconsistency that granite is classed as a mineral, while limestone and clay are free; as a matter of fact, limestone has far more the direct character of a mineral, because it is used with other minerals as a
<col>818</col>
flux, and clay again produces a mineral as alumina. Then with regard to capital it has been stated that the present policy of the Government is driving capital out of the country. I can speak from personal knowledge as to the very large accumulations of capital which have been sent out from this country to New York not only quick capital for investment but also capital in bulk in the shape of securities for safe-keeping. That necessitates an enormous reduction in the banking business of this country, and it also necessitates a very large increase in the business of the trust companies and banks in America to prepare for that work. In August and September the trust companies and banks had to form special departments to cope with this rush of securities and money sent to them from this country. The amount of quick capital and securities can be ascertained by referring to the records of stocks, shares, bonds, &amp;c., which have been sent across the Atlantic during the last few months. The right rev. Prelate, the Bishop of Birmingham, seemed to be very much afraid of the time it would take to obtain any prosperity from Tariff Reform. Why cannot we take a little benefit from the experience of the world? The world has been working for twenty years steadily on what we now call Tariff Reform. I say so because the Bismarck Act has shown us twenty years of actual fruition, and in America the principle has been working steadily for thirteen years. What we want in this country is prosperity, and, given that, we shall be able to overcome the difficulties of unemployment. Tariff Reform would give employment undoubtedly. By the adoption of this policy, which is that of the whole world, except our country, confidence will spring into life in every direction; capital will be produced and put into machinery; industry, and labour will be employed. We do not need to be pioneers, or to try experiments; the world has shown the way and we are behind the age in doubting the experience of the world.<lb/>
The Government moreover are extraordinarily inconsistent in regard to their proposals as to the so-called unearned increment. Apart from the question of minerals, how does it apply to by-products, such as pig iron which has gone through one process before leaving this country? We are shipping out of this country enormous
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0416"/>
<col>819</col>
quantities of pig iron which ought to be finished here and not in Germany, and is sent back to us in a finished state. Let us next come to agriculture. Every agricultural product that is not finished contains unearned increment. We consume eggs. Look at the extraordinary multiplication of unearned increment produced by an egg. And so it goes on. The inconsistency of so-called unearned increment, carried out by scientific figures, is an absurdity.<lb/>
Another subject I have very much at heart is the Navy. It is to this we look to save our food supply, and I ask "Has the Government in this respect done the duty we require of it?" I say "No." It has not provided the protection we require and it has starved our manufacturers in the past. We were told by the Prime Minister, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and by other Lords of the Admiralty that they had to acknowledge that they had been misled; and at that time it looked as if they would have been conservative enough to supply from this Budget sufficient ships ready for our use. It will be found, not to-day, nor to-morrow, but within a reasonable time that the Sea
<col>820</col>
Lords have all along demanded eight Dreadnoughts and all that went with them to secure the welfare of the country. We have to look at the battleship as the highest development, with its cruisers and destroyers round it, and with harbours and docks necessary for it, and in addition we have the increased <i>personnel</i> required for all this valuable machinery. This Budget does not provide for these, and I shall with the greatest pleasure vote against it for that reason if not for any other.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03413">Debate on the Amendment moved by the Marquess of Lansdowne to the Motion that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup> <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03414"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the brief observations which I am about to address to your Lordships, I do not propose any more than in the case of other speakers who have preceded me, to examine the present Budget in any sort of detail. The question we have to decide is eminently one of principle and not of detail. Moreover, the real point at issue is not whether, collectively or individually, we think this Budget good, bad, or indifferent, but whether we are justified in taking the very grave step of insisting that the matter should be referred to the decision of the nation. Nevertheless, my Lords, I should like to make a very few remarks on the financial proposals of His Majesty's Government, considered on their own merits. There are some good points in those proposals, and I cannot help thinking that the idea is rather exaggerated to hold that black ruin stares in the face of those on whom the burthen of the new taxation will more especially fall.<lb/>
For my own part I have nothing to say against the principle involved in the Income Tax proposals, and I do not entertain any objections to them, although I think the Super Tax will be extremely difficult to collect, and will probably be evaded by
<col>822</col>
many of those whom the Chancellor of the Exchequer most wishes to reach. Moreover, in spite of the explanations which have been given on this subject, I cannot help looking with some apprehension on the inroad which will be made on the main fiscal reserve on which we are accustomed to rely in time of war. Nevertheless, the principle involved in this part of the Budget is, in my opinion, sound enough. It is that the burthen of taxation is to be placed on the shoulders of those most capable of bearing it, and whatever theoretical arguments may be urged against the adoption of this principle, it is a practical fact that a man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year can well afford to bear a higher proportionate rate of taxation than a man with &#x00A3;500 or &#x00A3;1,000.<lb/>
But, in spite of this and some other points to which I do not think serious exception can be taken, I must say that the general financial policy of the Government inspires me with no confidence whatsoever. In the first place, my Lords, I should like to point out that the Budget in the form in which it was originally brought forward in the other House bore the evident marks of a light-hearted want of care and foresight, which is simply amazing, considering the gravity of the interests concerned. A good deal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's cargo had to be thrown overboard in order to lighten the ship during its passage through the other House. How, I would ask, could any serious financier think that any assembly of thinking men would ever agree to a man being taxed on the off-chance of his possessing minerals of questionable existence and of unknown value at an unknown depth in the bowels of the earth, or that Parliament would ever agree to allow the old Sinking Fund to be diverted from its proper and legitimate object&#x2014;that is to say, the reduction of the National Debt? Then, my Lords, as regards the Revenue Estimates. I was at first inclined to share the opinion that I think was very commonly held that the revenue had been very greatly under-estimated. Now we are told that such is not the case. One thing, however, is clear, and that is that the original Estimates were very faulty. Why is this? Experts will, I do not doubt, be able to give explanations under each separate head of account, but I cannot help thinking that there is one general explanation winch applies in a greater or less degree, in every case. That explanation is that by drifting into a position which necessitates casting
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0418"/>
<col>823</col>
the whole fiscal system of the country into the melting pot, and also by bringing forward proposals which, even if they are assumed to be innocuous in themselves, are supported by rancorous language evidently calculated to alarm all those classes on whom the national wealth, and, therefore, the national revenue mainly depends, the Chancellor of the Exchequer got himself into a position which has rendered the task of framing any trustworthy Estimates well-nigh impossible. Then, my Lords, I justify my want of confidence in the financial policy of the Government on the further ground that although they came into office pledged as a matter of fact to retrenchment they have thrown economy to the winds. Former Liberal Governments were economical because they were Free Traders, and I ought also to add they were able to be Free Traders because they were economical. They fully recognised that these two subjects&#x2014;economy in expenditure and Free Trade&#x2014;hung together. The present Government has endeavoured to be spendthrift and Free Traders, and the two characters do not harmonise.<lb/>
I know how useless it is to preach on this subject. I know and fully admit the urgency of social reform&#x2014;that is to say, reasonable social reform. I know that a great wave of extravagance is now passing over this country, which can only be arrested when bitter experience has shown that a nation, like an individual, must cut its coat according to its cloth. At the same time, I cannot allow this occasion to pass without uttering an old-fashioned protest against what appears to me to be the recklessness with which the finances of the State are now administered. Whether a resort be had to direct or to indirect taxation, no nation, however prosperous it may be, can with impunity go on living for long as we have been living for the last few years, without landing itself in great embarrassments, and this remark applies quite as much to local as to Imperial finance. Whatever may be the objects on which it is proposed to spend the money, I contend that it is unsound finance to incur heavy liabilities without having any idea as to how those liabilities are to be met, as was done last year, and at the same time to reduce taxation, as was done in the case of the Sugar Duties, which, although possibly open to some objections, did not constitute a serious burthen on the country or weigh very materially upon the taxpayers. The result
<col>824</col>
naturally is a recourse to desperate expedients, such as the heavy Death Duties which, at the proposed rates, as has been frequently pointed out in the course of this debate, simply mean that the country will, to a great extent, be living on its capital.<lb/>
I now turn to another point&#x2014;namely, the land clauses. We have been reminded in the course of the debate that your Lordships' House is often accused of being an assembly of landowners. You may therefore like to hear the opinion of one of your members who does not possess, and is never likely to possess, a single acre of land in this or in any other country. The only tax in the Budget which affects me personally is the increased Income Tax, which I have already said meets with my cordial approval because it is based on the principle that the man who is relatively rich should pay more than the man who is relatively poor. I contend, as was contended by the noble Marquess last night, that as regards the land clauses they are a flagrant violation of that very sound principle. It is not proposed to tax a man according to his wealth, I but according to the special form in which, I whether he be rich or poor, his wealth is invested. I think, my Lords, that this principle is thoroughly unsound. Neither would any modification of the details reconcile me to its adoption. I do not doubt that the laws regulating the tenure of land in this country are far from perfect, and are capable of being amended. Notably, I should be glad to see something done to strengthen the position of leaseholders in towns against ground landlords. But if this is to be done, let it be done in the ordinary way, that is to say, by introducing a Bill which both Houses of Parliament will be free to examine both in principle and in detail. Whatever may be the constitutional practice or precepts on this subject, I cannot help thinking that to bring forward a measure of this sort in the garb of a Finance Bill, and thus endeavour to stifle the opinions of those who are not only most interested, but best informed on all matters connected with the land system, is a very great abuse of power.<lb/>
What, however, is to be said of a procedure of this nature when it is recognised that the proposals of the Government under this head will do little, if anything, to solve the financial difficulties of the moment?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0419"/>
<col>825</col>
The fact is, that it is a mere abuse of terms to speak of the land clauses in the Bill as genuine financial measures. With the evidence now before us, it is impossible not to conclude that the primary object in introducing them is not to obtain revenue, but to pave the way for the introduction of profound changes of a Socialistic character in the system under which landed property is held in this country. This is all I have to say upon the Budget considered on its own merits. I now pass to the Amendment of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
My Lords, if we arrive at a faulty conclusion on this subject, it will certainly not be from want of advice. For months past we have been bombarded from all quarters with advice, not infrequently taking the form of menaces, which I agree with other speakers should be entirely disregarded. On the one hand, we have been told that those who, like myself, demur to the total rejection of this Budget are wanting in moral courage&#x2014;an argument to which I attach but slight importance; and we are also told that by the adoption of this view we should abdicate the special functions for which a Second Chamber is created&#x2014;an argument which, I fully admit, is of great weight and potency. On the other hand, the very unworthy insinuation is made that those of your Lordships who conscientiously hold a different opinion are animated by some motives of personal interest, and they are warned that if they insist on this view the time-honoured institution to which we belong will fall at the blast of the Limehouse and Newcastle trumpet. In view of the extreme gravity of this question and of the fact that it certainly rises in importances far above that of ordinary Party issues, I have&#x2014;like, I do not doubt, others of your Lordships&#x2014;endeavoured as an independent member to form a calm, dispassionate and independent judgment on this subject, unswayed by outside influences, and the result of my deliberations, which I state with great and unfeigned regret, is that in spite of the cogency of the arguments advanced by the noble Marquess, I am unable on this occasion to follow him into the Lobby. On the other hand, inasmuch as a vote adverse to the proposal of the noble Marquess might be construed into approval of a measure of which I wholly disapprove, I am reluctantly constrained to abstain from voting at all.<lb/>
<col>826</col>
The main consideration which has led me to this conclusion is one to which I do not think adequate attention has been paid in the course of the recent discussions. Although at this moment all European nations, including ourselves, are fortunately at peace, I cannot say that the general state of Europe is such as to render it possible to regard without some apprehension the inauguration of a state of things which, by producing acute and prolonged dissentions in this country, may not improbably cripple us to a certain extent in the event of any great national emergency arising. And, my Lords, it cannot, I think, be doubted that the result of throwing out this Bill will be to produce acute and prolonged dissensions, for it will almost oblige even the most moderate members of the Liberal Party to engage in a ceaseless agitation in order to secure a material alteration, not merely in the composition, but the functions of the Second Chamber. I consider that the first and greatest national necessity at this moment is to provide, both from a naval and military point of view, for the adequate defence of this country, and I should more especially view with a feeling little short of dismay anything calculated to risk a break in the continuity of that naval policy as to the main principles of which both Parties in the State are now agreed. I may be right or wrong in pushing this view to the extent to which I push it, and I am quite free to admit that I hold this opinion so strongly that it colours my views on all other political matters, and makes them subordinate to that one great consideration. I am, of course, perfectly aware that I shall be told that if it actually came to a case of war, the voice of faction would be hushed, and that all Parties in the country would be united. I hope, and believe, that will be the case, but that is not what I fear. What I do fear is that in the presence of distracted counsels, and of the great temptation which will be presented on both sides to influence and conciliate the mass of the electors by incurring not reasonable but extravagant expenditure on social reforms, the main duty of the nation, which is to render its own existence secure, will be rather lost sight of in the constitutional struggle which must ensue; and pray bear in mind, my Lords, that any lapse, even any temporary lapse, from a state of preparedness for war will, of itself, increase the probability that war will occur.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0420"/>
<col>827</col>
On the whole, therefore, I have come to the conclusion that, objectionable as this Budget is, we cannot reject it without incurring other and more formidable risks than would be involved in its acceptance. Let me add that I have come to this conclusion in my own mind quite irrespective of the question of Free Trade <i>versus</i> Tariff Reform. Important though that issue is, it appears to me almost to sink into insignificance by the side of the further and very important issues which will now be raised.<lb/>
Before I sit down, I trust it will not be thought irrelevent to the present discussion if I allude briefly to the position of Unionist Free Traders in respect to this Budget, and also generally with regard to the contest which now awaits us. That position is, I fully admit, one of some difficulty. Let me preface my remarks by saying that I do not in any way profess to represent the views of Unionist Free Traders generally. Although I happen, as President of the Unionist Free Trade Club, to be the very unworthy successor of the late Duke of Devonshire, whose wise counsels and statesmanlike voice were assuredly never more missed than on the present occasion, I have no sort of mandate to represent the members of that club. I wish it, therefore, to be very clearly understood that I am only giving my opinion as an individual Unionist Free Trader for what it is worth. My individual opinion is that in the coming General Election a Unionist Free Trade voter who, in the absence of a candidate who fully represents his own views, votes for a Tariff Reform candidate, as I should certainly do if I had a vote, need not abandon one iota of his Free Trade principles any more than I abandon mine. I wish, my Lords, to make my own attitude in connection with this matter quite clear.<lb/>
I do not doubt that it will be necessary to impose indirect taxes for revenue purposes&#x2014;a necessity to which, although he may regret it, no Free Trader can take any exception on Free Trade principles. But I hold just as strongly as ever that Protection is not the proper weapon by which Socialism can be combated. I scout now, as much as ever, the idea that the unemployment problem can be solved by the adoption of a Protectionist policy.<lb/>
<col>828</col>
I still maintain that Colonial preference is not merely objectionable on fiscal grounds, but that it is an error to suppose that it will do anything towards cementing the different parts of the Empire any more than was the case when it was tried sixty years ago. I still entertain the strongest objection against taxes on food or raw material, and I still hold as strongly as ever that the adoption of a Protective policy is calculated to demoralise public life in this country, as it has demoralised that of the United States. As to Retaliation, I have not the least objection, provided that there is a reasonable prospect held out to us that, by the adoption of such a measure, we shall not do ourselves more harm than good, and provided also that we maintain a Navy of over-powering strength, a consideration which, if a retaliatory policy is pursued, will become one even of more vital importance than it is at present. Personally, I do not take nearly so gloomy a view of the prospects of Free Trade as that held by some other Free Traders. I cannot in the least accept the view that there is no other alternative than either the acceptance of the present Budget or the adoption of anything like an extreme Tariff Reform policy, and it is an extreme Tariff Reform policy to which I and others object, not so much to a moderate policy of Tariff Reform. It is absurd to suppose that any such policy can be carried out, involving as it does something like a fiscal revolution, without a much more decisive expression of public opinion in its favour than has yet been obtained, or is at all likely to be obtained. I repeat that in my view Unionist Free Traders who are in the position, as they often must be, that they must either abstain from voting or else vote for a Tariff Reformer, need not, in choosing the latter alternative, abandon any one of their essential principles, but may well adopt the latter course with a perfectly clear conscience. Voting for a Tariff Reformer is by no means the same thing as voting for Tariff Reform. It will merely imply that the Unionist Free Trader is prepared to proclaim a truce, and will lay aside his special ideas in order to subserve other, and, as I consider, even more important ends.<lb/>
And what are those ends? The first and perhaps most important of all, is to ensure the continued existence of the effective Second Chamber The second
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0421"/>
<col>829</col>
is to maintain the union with Ireland and thus prevent the disruption of the Empire. The two issues, that of the Second Chamber and the maintenance of the Empire, are intimately connected. This has been fully recognised by the leaders of the Irish Nationalist Party. A third end is to ensure the existence of the Established Church and to prevent the secularisation of education; and a fourth end is to combat Socialism. My Lords, I wish I could share the optimist view that is often expressed that Socialism in this country is a bugbear, but I am afraid that I am unable to do so. We have been living for the last half century and more relying on the very comfortable assurance that the good sense of the British nation and the free-play of our time-honoured institutions will always conjure any Socialistic dangers. I hope that may be the case. I cannot, however, forget that the main apostle and creator of Socialism, Earl Marx, who was a man of great ability and foresight, writing more than half a century ago, looked on Great Britain as a far more hopeful field for the development of his most pernicious theories than any Continental country. I cannot forget that many of the older economists, looking more especially to the unequal distribution of property in this country, shared this view, although they disagreed with Karl Marx on every other point.<lb/>
I cannot blind myself to the fact that Socialism has made enormous strides in this country during the last few years. I do not mean revolutionary Socialism, of which I have little fear&#x2014;indeed, I should be rather glad if we had a few more Victor Graysons in this country because they prove very useful danger signals&#x2014;but rather the advance of those plausible and insiduous methods for making the worse appear the better cause, which have converted thousands of excellent and well-intentioned people to Socialism who would warmly resent the idea of being called Socialists. There are a very large number of people in this country who are Socialists without in the least knowing it, and I fear their number is increasing daily. I know that Unionist Free Traders are told that they should support the present Government, as the defenders of free imports, and because the Tariff Reformers are themselves tainted with Socialist ideas. I venture to express a hope that Unionist Free Traders will not be led away by this
<col>830</col>
very fallacious argument. I am perfectly well aware that from time immemorial there has always been a distinct connection between Protection and Socialism, but I would ask Unionist Free Traders to consider on which side the main danger really lies.<lb/>
On the one hand you have a Party who are certainly not Socialists, but advocates of social reform, and every reasonable man and practical politician must admit that the extreme individualism of some fifty or sixty years ago has to be abandoned, and you also have a body of men as to whom I still cherish a hope that they may eventually bring forward some fiscal proposals to which no reasonable Free Trader can take any serious or reasonable exception. On the other hand, you have a Government which by its acts has done more to imperil the cause of Free Trade than all the arguments of the Tariff Reformers put together, and which, although it may have preserved free imports has, in my opinion, run counter to many of the leading principles of that economic system of which free imports merely constitute a part. When we see, not merely the rank and file, but even some of the leading members of the Radical Party coquetting with such questions as land and railway nationalisation, I say it is impossible to doubt on which side the main danger lies.<lb/>
These, my Lords, broadly speaking, are, in my opinion, the main considerations which should be present to the mind of the Unionist Free Trader during the coming struggle. But let me add that they have, I venture to think, a right to ask for some amount of reciprocity. We Unionist Free Traders, holding, as we do, to opinions which it must be borne in mind were but yesterday those of the entire nation, think that we have at times not been treated with much fairness or consideration by some sections of the Unionist Party, and if I do not dwell on these grievances any more it is because I think that the present is a moment to assuage rather than to aggravate differences in the ranks of the Unionist Party. The struggle in which the Unionist Party is about to be engaged will be arduous, probably more so than any of years past. It appears to me that the chances of success will be enormously diminished by anything approaching to disunion. The Unionist Party will require,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0422"/>
<col>831</col>
not only every vote, but every voice it can obtain. The importance of this question is not to be measured by the loss or gain of some two or three seats. It is much more far-reaching. There are a good many Free Trade Unionists&#x2014;far more, I believe, than is generally supposed&#x2014;scattered about the constituencies. There are also a great many moderate men who, without being avowed Free Traders, are by no means ardent Tariff Reformers, and who, I have every reason to believe, in common with many Unionist Free Traders, are inclined to deeply resent the somewhat shortsighted, and, as I think, vindictive policy which has been adopted towards Unionist Free Traders by a few extreme sections of the Tariff Reform Party. I would ask, my Lords, is it wise, is it politic, just, or generous at the bidding of a few, who, without wishing to be discourteous, I really must call fanatics, to cast out from the Unionist Party such men as Lord Robert Cecil, Lord Hugh Cecil, Mr. Bowles, and others, who have done yeoman service in the cause of the Unionist Party in Parliament, and whose only fault is that they have had the courage of their opinions and are not prepared to bow to the iron tyranny of the caucus? I cannot think that is wise, and inasmuch as I, and I think some other Unionist Free Traders, are prepared to use whatever influence we possess in the sense of promoting unity of action, I appeal confidently to those of your Lordships and others outside this House who do not share our views on the fiscal question, to reciprocate in the sense of doing whatever is possible to ensure that union which will, in itself, be an earnest of success. In any case, I wish to make it quite clear that, albeit I fully maintain my allegiance to Free Trade principles, I cannot, in the struggle which is now about to take place, in any way associate myself with measures calculated to embarrass the action of the noble Marquess behind me and his friends, and I earnestly hope that other Unionist Free Traders will follow my example.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03415"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not attempt to follow the noble Earl into the political views which he has expressed this afternoon. Suffice it for me to say that we always listen to the noble Earl in this House with profound respect. We recognise that his financial knowledge and experience are vast and profound, and
<col>832</col>
consequently I for my part was glad to hear that the noble Earl after mature consideration, found that he was not in favour of the financial proposals which are before us. I will not detain your Lordships in the remarks that I venture to make more than a brief space of time. I will, in the first place, examine the proposals of His Majesty's Government in the light of their effect on the finances of the country, and then I will examine them in the light of their effect on the position of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The financial proposals before us affect three classes of His Majesty's, subjects&#x2014;the taxpayer, the labourer, and the financier. Closely connected with the interests of the taxpayer is the question of the relation between direct and indirect taxation. Let us bear in mind that at the beginning of the nineteenth century indirect taxation largely exceeded direct taxation. It was the aim of Liberal Statesmen and financiers to try and reduce that inequality, and Mr. Gladstone in 1861 spoke of the importance of preserving a just balance. He could not think, he said, of direct and indirect taxation without comparing them to two attractive sisters who had been introduced into the gay world of London each with an ample fortune and differing only in the respect that one was of a light and another of a dark complexion, or in some variety of manner, one being open and the other shy, retiring, and insinuating, and Mr. Gladstone went on to say that as Chancellor of the Exchequer, if not as a member of Parliament, he always thought it not only allowable but even an act of duty to pay his addresses to both. Later on Mr. Gladstone's example was followed by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, who, during the South African war, increased the Income Tax and at the same time imposed a duty on sugar, and up to this present time the Government have faithfully followed the traditions of their predecessors. So that to-day the relation between direct and indirect taxation is about equal.<lb/>
But, my Lords, when we come to examine the proposals which are before us, and which we are called upon to pass, what are the facts which present themselves to our notice? They are that whereas the ratio between direct and indirect taxation, was about equal, the acceptance of the present I proposals would create a ratio of fifty-seven for direct taxation to forty-three for indirect taxation. No doubt it wall be claimed
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0423"/>
<col>833</col>
by noble Lords opposite that this is sound finance. It is what they term "placing the burden on the broadest shoulders," making those taxpayers pay whom they consider most capable of bearing the taxes. Let us examine this contention a little more closely. If a citizen is called upon to pay increased contributions under the heading of direct taxation, surely he retrenches by reducing his expenditure on those simple luxuries such as wine, whisky, and tobacco which form the basis of indirect taxation; the result, therefore, is that excessive direct taxation tends to lower the yield of indirect taxation. Your Lordships will notice that the Government propose to get over this difficulty by increasing the Death Duties, raising the Income Tax, and imposing a Super Tax; so that they intend to increase the disparity and not in any way to restore the balance. In other words, the fiscal disease is to be cured by accentuating its cause.<lb/>
Let me examine the effect of this inequality between direct and indirect taxation on the economic welfare of the country. Let me deal first of all with the Income Tax payer. The consideration of the Income Tax reminds me that we enjoy in this country 110 or 120 millions of money the result of income derived from foreign investments. It is calculated, I believe, that out of that sum eighty millions come to Great Britain and are taxed at the banks and thus brought within the area of the taxation of the Exchequer. But what would be the effect of those proposals for graduating and increasing the Income Tax as is specified in Clauses 65 and 66 of this Bill. The average citizen will think twice before he allows his income to be brought under the jurisdiction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he may resort to perfectly legal methods to evade his national contributions to the State. There are many methods which have been suggested, some of them even by those who are supporters of noble Lords opposite. Income can be brought into this country, I believe in the shape of bullion or of pictures, or in the form of works of art, or of commodities, and then re-sold, and so far as I am aware that is a perfectly legitimate method and would defy detection. Again, if moneys the result of interest on foreign securities are reinvested abroad, only for quite a short period, only a year, is it not possible to bring those moneys back again into this country in the shape of capital, and consequently they would not come under the
<col>834</col>
system of taxation proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. So much for income tax.<lb/>
What are the Death Duties as amended in Clause 54, Schedule 2, of this Bill? Do not the same considerations apply equally to the accumulation of capital at the death of an individual? Moneys, for instance, which have been accumulated by an individual and which remain in a foreign bank under the account of two joint individuals, at the death of one of them, it seems to me, would not come under the area of the jurisdiction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Even the Government themselves have betrayed their anxiety in this matter. Is it not the fact that they have invited the co-operation of foreign Governments to disclose the private affairs of the citizens of their respective countries, and that these proposals on the part of His Majesty's Government have not been accepted by foreign Powers except in the case of France? I do not doubt it will be urged that it is unpatriotic on the part of any citizen to attempt to evade his proper contributions to the State. I am not hereto defend that proposition. We are not moralists here, we are legislators and the considerations before us are simply these, that opportunities do exist for the evasion of one particular form of tax by a certain section of His Majesty's subjects who are in possession of fluid and fugitive capital, while another section of the community who are in the enjoyment of revenue which by virtue of its immobility cannot escape but must bear the full force and weight of the tax. I leave the discussion of this particular tax with this final observation, that it is impossible to view a tax as equitable when it is clear that its imposition might be followed by a whole series of legal evasions on the part of those citizens upon whom it is designed to fall. The point is a pertinent one because it is supported by the collective wisdom of His Majesty's Government themselves. Clause 95 of this Bill displays an official fear of evasion, for it lays down that a penalty of imprisonment is to be enforced upon those citizens who, being less astute than their neighbours, fail to invoke the law sufficiently to their aid.<lb/>
I now come to the case of the labourer, the wage-earner who is dependent upon capital. I do not think that it can be a source of anxiety to us if capital should leave these shores if we are assured that this country has got as much capital as it requires, and that it cannot reasonably
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0424"/>
<col>835</col>
absorb any more. That point was most lucidly brought out last night by the noble Lord who spoke from the Back Benches, but when we hear the Prime Minister rejoicing at the departure of capital, surely we may ask whether its emigration is due to the fact that capital can no longer find suitable investment in this country, owing to its abundance here already. The answer seems pretty clear. The high rate of interest upon Consolidated Stock, combined with the exceptionally high percentage of skilled artisans who are out of employment&#x2014;7&#x00B7;7&#x2014;clearly and conclusively proves that that is not the case. My Lords, I have always understood that the citizen would much sooner invest his money at home where it is under his immediate control and supervision. The facts which I venture to bring to your Lordships' notice place it beyond doubt that there is a field for investment in this country.<lb/>
Why, then, is capital going abroad? It is going abroad because it is safer abroad. But why is it more secure abroad? The inroads upon capital under the terms of Part III and Part IV of this Finance Bill are so severe relative to the demands made upon capital by Exchequers in other parts of the world, that it is no exaggeration to say that His Majesty's Government have by their financial proposals succeeded in displacing the centre of financial security. I would not have ventured to deal with this subject of capital, in which no doubt we are considered to be peculiarly and personally interested, were it not that the relations between capital and labour are so closely interwoven. It cannot be a matter of indifference to the citizen of this country if the interest on foreign investments alone is spent in Great Britain, or whether the capital itself is invested in this country, and if it be true that capital and labour are inseparably bound up together, if it be true that they are mutually interdependent, then if one party to the bargain goes away to different lands and takes his money with him, the other party&#x2014;the wage-earner&#x2014;must either be left at home to starve or emigrate. The latter alternative seems the more probable one to be adopted; but, surely, my Lords, the international position of our country is not such that we can contemplate to-day a stationary population with equanimity.<lb/>
My Lords, I pass to the final consideration,
<col>836</col>
that of the financier, and I only allude to it in order to show your Lordships that the attack of the Government on capital is complete. Lord Revelstoke pointed out last night the position of the foreign market, and I believe it is a fact to-day that the American stock market has gained a prominence verging on predominance in South America, and, indeed, even in the Far East. In these distant fields it is becoming more difficult every day for Great Britain to maintain a strong position. The imposition of new and heavy Stamp Duties under Clauses 73 to 79 of this Bill may suffice to turn the issue definitely against us. I believe that these fears are shared by many; they certainly were shared by Lord Revelstoke last night, and it is a significant fact that the opposition to these particular proposals of the Finance Bill has been strongly endorsed by the majority of those, irrespective of Party, whose names rightly represent the collective wisdom of the City.<lb/>
Let me pass quite briefly over the second aspect of the case. The first fifty-four clauses of this Finance Bill, tending as they do to single out two classes of the community for exceptional financial treatment, are brought forward with intent to undermine the political power of your Lordships' House. It is within your Lordships' recollection that the Licensing Bill of last year sought to reduce by its proposals one-third of the existing licences within fourteen years, and that at the end of eighteen or twenty years all licences should revert absolutely to the State. On that measure being rejected by this House we believe that the country supported us, and we still have every ground for belief that that action was in harmony with popular wishes. But under the proposals in Clauses 43 and 44 of this Bill, if they were allowed to come into operation, the position of the brewer would be absolutely crippled, and certainly one-third of the licences in the period of years contemplated under the Bill would be reduced. You will therefore notice that the end aimed at in the proposals which were rejected by your Lordships last year are now to be attained under the guise and under the supposed safe conduct of a Finance Bill. The Government are trying to make your Lordships stultify your decision of last year. Either in order to penalise a class or to gain a Party end, Ministers have called to their aid a constitutional weapon such as no previous Administration have ventured to employ.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0425"/>
<col>837</col>
But the spirit of Party vindictiveness failed to find full expression in an attack upon a single class. It was only by an attack upon the licensed trade together with a campaign against the landed interest that the Government could insure that whatever the decision of your Lordships with regard to this Finance Bill was, they could claim that that decision was based on selfish considerations.<lb/>
My Lords, we are to be placed in a political dilemma. If we accept the financial proposals before us we shall be told that we have sacrificed those whom noble Lords opposite call our political allies in obedience to an instinct of self-preservation. If, on the other hand, we reject these proposals we shall be told that we have done so out of selfish and egotistical considerations, and not with a view to the welfare and prosperity of the community as a whole. My Lords, for fear of being denounced as an egoist, and one deeply interested in land monopoly, I will not discuss the details of the land clauses. They were fully dealt with last night by the noble Marquess. It is sufficient for me to say this, that involving as they do the maximum of expenditure by the State for a minimum return to the Exchequer, they seem to me to be the most curious financial proposals ever submitted to your Lordships' House. The only other comment I make upon them is that they have been supported by language of peculiar vindictiveness and remarkable abuse unparalleled, so far as I am aware, in our public and our political controversies. These sections of the community, the land interest and the licensed trade, have been singled out to bear a special degree of increased taxation without one single sober piece of evidence having been produced throughout the whole of this debate to show that the increased burdens imposed on these two sections of the community would in the long run be of benefit to the country at large. I have ventured to point out that the character of these proposals, destroying as they do the balance between direct and indirect taxation, is injurious alike to the capitalists and to the wage-earning classes, and that it threatens the position of the British money market. I have ventured to show, too, that the motive which inspires those actions is not a single-minded pursuit of the national welfare, but is tainted by a desire to strike at those whose existence is a bar to the dominion of the demagogue; and I say,
<col>838</col>
both by virtue of their character and their motives, that these proposals should not pass into law until they have been submitted to the judgment of the people of this country.<lb/>
Will your Lordships permit me to go one step further? These financial proposals, tested by a standard by which the Government themselves would claim to be judged, mark a breach in our financial traditions. The canons of taxation laid down by Adam Smith are always accepted by noble Lords opposite and by all Free-Traders as a direct economic revelation. Adam Smith said that taxation should be equal. This Budget discriminates against classes. Adam Smith said that taxation should be certain. The sudden imposition of a Super Tax is arbitrary. Adam Smith said that taxes should be levied at a convenient moment. The increased Death Duties would fall at a time of inevitable financial disorganisation. Adam Smith said that taxation should be cheap to collect. The land taxes are dear to collect. Surely, my Lords, when the Government bring forward financial proposals which, as this debate has shown, have not received the mead of approval from the majority of your Lordships, and in addition it is clear that these proposals violate the financial doctrines which they themselves were elected to uphold, surely the Government need a special degree of assurance that the people of England are in agreement with them? But in spite of the special need of such an assurance His Majesty's Ministers steadfastly refuse to refer to the country, except, of course, in their perorations. The question, therefore, is whether we have the right to step in and claim that the people should be consulted.<lb/>
Last night the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack dealt at great length with matters referring to the Paper Duties Bill of 1860, and I must ask your Lordships to kindly permit me to read one or two extracts which are very pertinent to the consideration of this matter. In moving the Second Reading of that Bill in 1860, Lord Granville, the Government spokesman, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The legal technical right of rejecting I do not deny. The very preamble of the Bill shows it. The question being put four times to your Lordships' House shows it."</quote>
The constitutional aspect of this question was examined with great erudition by Lord
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0426"/>
<col>839</col>
Lyndhurst, one of the most honourable and venerable members of your Lordships' House, in a speech delivered on his eighty-ninth birthday. "I take leave to say," declared Lord Lyndhurst&#x2014;
<quote>"that there is not an instance to be found in which the House of Commons has controverted our right to reject Money Bills."</quote>
Lord Lyndhurst propounded a doctrine which will be endorsed by every noble Lord in this House who proposes to vote for the Amendment. "We exercise those rights," he said "not for ourselves, but for the people." The Bill was rejected, and in the following July the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, moved three Resolutions in the House of Commons, the second of which explicitly lays down and admits your Lordships' right to reject Money Bills, though it goes on to observe that the exercise of this right has always been viewed with peculiar jealousy by the House of Commons. I must confess, when I listened to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack last night and he reminded your Lordships of those Resolutions, that I was anxious to hear the noble and learned Lord read that second Resolution, and I felt when he quoted the Resolutions in their general form that his researches had been of too discriminating a character. My Lords, the Prime Minister's words on this occasion were emphatic. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is well known that the Bills so prepared and framed by us cannot pass into law without the assent of the Lords; and it is clear that an authority whose assent is necessary to give a proposal the force of law must, by the very nature of things, be at liberty to dissent and refuse its sanction. To take from the Lords the power of dissenting to a Bill to which their assent is now required you would need an Act of Parliament to which they must themselves be a party, or you must by a revolutionary proceeding subvert our existing Constitution."</quote>
There are to-day some who, anxious to turn constitutional theory to their own ends, are willing to assert that it is your Lordships' House which now intends by a revolutionary proceeding to subvert our existing Constitution. The debate on the Resolutions led to a speech from Mr. Disraeli, which was of special interest because he considered the method of combining all the Tax Bills into a single Finance Bill, which was actually adopted in the following year. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We do not&#x2014;at least I, for one, and the Prime Minister, for another, do not&#x2014;question the right of the House of Lords to reject such a Bill."</quote>
Mr. Disraeli went on to foreshadow a
<col>840</col>
Budget which it would be absurd to deny the rights of your Lordships' House to reject, and his description of that Budget was very similar to that of the Budget now before the House. In the following year the various separate proposals were combined into a single measure, and this was the comment on the man&#x0153;uvre offered by Lord Robert Cecil, the father of the noble Marquess sitting behind me&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing can be more vain and more futile than the device by which the Chancellor of the Exchequer attempts to fetter the action of the House of Lords for future years. Why, Sir, if the occasion should again happen&#x2014;which I pray may not be the case&#x2014;that the House of Commons should act so madly and improperly as it acted last year, and that it should call down upon itself the condemnation of the public, the House of Lords will not be fettered by this or any other form from taking its legitimate operation."</quote>
I cannot help feeling that the views which Mr. Disraeli expressed in 1860 on the constitutional position of your Lordships' House are indeed different from those laid down by the noble and learned Lord last night. When that Bill came back to your Lordships' House in 1861, the Duke of Rutland moved its rejection, and although it was not pressed to a Division the constitutional legality of that action was accepted by men like Lord Granville, Lord Derby, the Duke of Argyll and Lord Grey. The cumulative effect of the views expressed in 1860 and 1861 are, to my mind, overwhelming, and I venture to say your Lordships will not find a right more definitely established by law, more absolutely justified by custom, practice and tradition, or more conclusively endorsed by leading statesmen of both Parties in either House than the right of your Lordships to reject a Money Bill.<lb/>
Taking this point as proved, the question which now arises for your Lordships is whether this occasion is one on which we should exercise the right which we possess, but which, like all rights, should be used, as the noble Marquess reminded us last night, with circumspection and with extreme discretion. My Lords, we have had occasion in previous debates to notice the growing power of the bureaucracy. It is now urged that our political activities should be suspended, our political functions interrupted, and our political rights abrogated, because their exercise is in conflict with the convenience of the bureaucracy. The Government, together with the bureaucracy, claim to override the sentiments
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0427"/>
<col>841</col>
of your Lordships' House, forgetting that the assertion of such a claim is to ignore the fact that ultimate sovereignty resides&#x2014;I use a constitutional phrase&#x2014;not with the King in Council but with the King in Parliament. My Lords, if such a doctrine were allowed to prevail, it would profoundly affect the position of your Lordships' House. For what is the position you find yourselves in to-day? The relations of this House with the lower House, which the Government propose to disturb, are in themselves a monument to the political sagacity of the British people. Their adjustment has been perfected by the genius of great men. That subtle and delicate equipoise has been preserved practically unchanged during centuries by the statecraft of leading men in either House, so that to-day it bears something of that mysterious sanctity which time alone can give. It is as with the Abbey within whose shadow we deliberate. Inspired architects planned its noble outline, its solid walls, its flowing buttresses, and its dominating towers. Zealous masons laboured to transmute the architectural vision into the reality of solid stone. But not all the splendour of the initial conception nor the patient services of its builders could have sufficed to win for the Abbey the place which it holds in our hearts to-day. Time has touched it with his finger, and to his ineffable touch it owes its ultimate consecration. So I say it is with the relations between the two Houses of Parliament in the vital matter of finance. They, too, are the result of a noble political inspiration. They, too, have been slowly upreared in the passage of the centuries. They, too, have been hallowed by tradition. Yet to-day the Government, acting through the Lower House, are prepared to lay rude and irreverent hands upon a political fabric which has won the admiration of the civilised world. This magnificent monument, this unique expression of the temperament of our people is to be shattered at the bidding of a demagogue from Wales, and may I respectfully add, by the threat of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03418"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the peroration which he has addressed to the House, the noble Duke who has just sat down made two mistakes which it seems to me to fall to my duty to correct. By his characterisation of my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who so far as his own personal responsibility in this matter is concerned is well able to defend himself, the noble Duke implied that this measure came up to your Lordships' House at the bidding of my right hon. friend and of him alone. Let me disabuse the noble Duke, if I can, of any such notion. This Budget has behind it the united and unanimous support of His Majesty's Government, and it is with the support, and the overwhelming support, of the House of Commons, that it comes to your Lordships' House. Another notion, which I seem to detect in the peroration of the noble Duke was this, that in his view we, the Government, are the aggressors, and the challengers in this quarrel. That is not our view, and I shall endeavour to show why it is not our view in the course of the observations which I shall ask leave to address, to your Lordships.<lb/>
The noble Duke travelled over a somewhat wide field. He condemned the the alteration in the balance between direct and indirect taxation which has been brought about by this Budget, and he seemed to think that because a certain percentage of the national revenue was collected in indirect taxation, and a certain percentage in direct taxation, that that ended the matter. My Lords, we have to see on whose shoulders these burdens are laid. It is a fact that four-fifths of the indirect taxation of this country is paid by the working classes, and if your Lordships wish to inquire what additional burden is laid upon the working classes as compared with the rich, I will give you one figure by which you can test it. The extra burden laid upon the working man with a wage of 30<i>s</i>. per week is 2<i>d</i>. in the pound. In the case of a person with an income of &#x00A3;5,000 a year, the extra taxation
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0428"/>
<col>843</col>
which he is called upon to bear is 5<i>d</i>. in the pound. Is there any one of your Lordships who will deny that the man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year is far better able to bear the additional burden laid upon him, although it is more than double that which is laid upon the working man, than the man with 30<i>s</i>. a week? In the one case it is some slight subtraction from the margin of income which is spent on luxury, or in whatever way you like. Would any of your Lordships maintain that the man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year must suffer in the necessaries of life because 5<i>d</i>. in the pound is taken from him as an additional sum in taxation? But, my Lords, in the case of the working man, it is very different. Take 2<i>d</i>. in the pound from the working man, and you touch possibly his house accommodation, his food, his education for his children; you cripple that man's expenditure, and when you look at the burden of direct and indirect taxation&#x2014;I do not wish to trouble further with regard to this matter on this occasion, but the noble Duke alluded to it&#x2014;you must look upon whose shoulders you place the burden before you can determine whether the burden is a just one or not.<lb/>
Then the noble Duke went on to characterise our proposals as an attack upon capital. The noble Marquess last night gave some figures with regard to the public issues of capital for home undertakings, which I confess I was not able to follow or to understand. He said that while in the year 1908 fifty-five millions was the total of public issues for home undertakings, in the first ten months of 1909 that fifty-five millions was represented by a sum of twenty millions. I have done my best to verify those figures. I cannot understand where they came from, but I have ascertained this, that so far as public issues are concerned&#x2014;and that does not represent the measure of industrial enterprise at all&#x2014;they have not varied very greatly during the last six years for home undertakings. But if we must be particular, if your Lordships will look at the figures you will find that in spite of a high bank rate, and in spite of the American financial catastrophe of two years ago, the public issues for home undertakings during the last three years are considerably greater in amount than they were during the previous three years, which, be it noted, were the last three years of the late Unionist Administration. But, my Lords, if the noble Marquess's figures are right, what
<col>844</col>
do they mean? They mean probably&#x2014;I am hazarding the view&#x2014;that the proportion between the money raised publicly for home industrial undertakings and that raised privately has varied. The figures afford no proof whatever that there has been a reduction in the amount of money raised for home undertakings, for, as your Lordships are well aware, not all industrial undertakings come to London for their money, and not all of those undertakings raise their money publicly; they are subscribed for privately, and their figures are therefore not obtainable and consequently not comparable.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Revelstoke, said last night that he was bound to protest, and to point out to your Lordships that Consols had fallen from eighty-nine to eighty-three. I should have liked to ask the noble Lord whether he would have protested equally strongly when some years ago Consols fell from 113 or 114 to eighty-nine, a much greater fall and the cause of which is much more easily traced than the cause of the fall at present. Then it has been hinted in this debate, and it has been widely alleged outside, that the fact that British capital goes abroad is a bad sign. Surely it is the other way. The fact that there is British capital floating into foreign undertakings is an index of the prosperity and the financial welfare of this country, and so long as industrial undertakings in this country can borrow for their purposes at a lower rate than the German Empire can upon its public credit, I do not think that there is much wrong with the financial position of this country. The corollary, of course, of the implication in this statement with regard to British capital is that this country is not a desirable country for men of great wealth to live in. I ask your Lordships to think in what other country there is the same security, the same protection, as there is in this country for men of large wealth and great means to live in. There is one cause, and it is a temporary cause, of disturbance of the business interests of this country at this moment, and that is the fear of a General Election. A disturbance and interruption of the trade of the country has been unexpectedly thrust upon the people; let me add, not by the action of the Government, but by those who are its critics.<lb/>
I think I have said enough to indicate that I share the opinion of the noble Earl
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0429"/>
<col>845</col>
who opened the debate this afternoon, and I think I may quote what he said in support of what I have now urged upon your Lordships' attention when he used the words "that he was not of opinion that black ruin stared us in the face in this country." But I confess, if there has been too much emphasis in my humble judgment laid on this aspect of the case, there has in other respects been no adequate recognition of the gravity of the case which we are now arguing. The question whether your Lordships' House can, as the noble Marquess put it, legally reject this or any other Money Bill, does not seem to me to be much more than a purely academic one. That is admitted on all hands; but when we go on to discuss the further question whether your Lordships ought, as the noble Marquess puts it, to reject this Bill, it is perhaps permissible to point out that the noble Marquess could not quote one single instance nor one single authority in support of what he urged upon your Lordships, for the very good reason that what you propose has never been done before. Parliament has never, in all its history, at the bidding of the House of Lords refused Supplies to the Crown. There have been various changes in the form of procedure in regard to Money Bills, but during all the centuries through which this ancient and honourable House has lived, it has never taken the step which your Lordships propose to take at the suggestion of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said that there would be "a little chaos." He suggested that with the co-operation of the Government that chaos could be avoided. The noble Marquess must know very well that to anything which savours of tampering with the privileges of the House of Commons the Government can be no party. The relations between the two Houses of Parliament have for years subsisted on the principle of give and take. The noble Marquess seems to think that some Budget might be patched up&#x2014;some accommodation, I believe is the financial term, some temporary accommodation might be provided&#x2014;and he seemed to indicate that there the trouble and the difficulty would end. My Lords, if you take this step, it is an irrevocable one. Things can never be again what they once were. In the first instance, you destroy the authority which has hitherto attached to Resolutions of the House of Commons in the matter of
<col>846</col>
raising taxation. You destroy the control of the House of Commons&#x2014;the exclusive control which the House of Commons has hitherto exercised over expenditure. You paralyse the Executive. You may have financial chaos; you will certainly have what I may call constitutional chaos; for you propose to abrogate the cardinal constitutional convention which has hitherto regulated the relations between the two Houses. And if you once take that step you bring things to a deadlock from which there is no escape but by some revolutionary change. The Constitution of this country is surely devised so that we may ascertain the will of the people through the elected House of Parliament. That, I take it, is the meaning of living under representative Government.<lb/>
The Resolution which the noble Marquess has moved plausibly seeks to identify his purpose with that which is the purpose, of our Constitution. The same plea might be urged about any Bill. The same plea might be urged every session about every Bill until you come to not Government by representation but Government by plebiscite. Added to that, it is surely doubtful whether any General Election gives an utterly decisive vote on any particular issue. You have financial confusion, and you have constitutional confusion, and you have what I may call parliamentary confusion by this step.<lb/>
Now, the noble Marquess in his speech, if I may turn to that for a moment, made a skilful appeal to all your Lordships who may be inclined to follow him. I have heard of an Omnibus Bill and an Omnibus Resolution. The noble Marquess's speech was certainly an Omnibus Speech. He tried in the case of those who had objections to any of the proposals contained in the Finance Bill, to attract them all to his standard. He mentioned first the Death Duties; called them odious and capricious. My Lords, the principle of the Death Duties is the same now as it was fifteen years ago when they were first enacted, and during twelve of those fifteen years the Party which noble Lords opposite support has been in power. They have had their own opportunity of altering or modifying the Death Duties. But let me remind noble Lords opposite that there are others besides the noble Marquess who will have something to say to these proposals. It is common
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0430"/>
<col>847</col>
knowledge that the Leader in the House of Commons, whatever might be thought by your Lordships here, while he has strenuously objected to the land proposals and the licensing proposals has certainly thrown his &#x00E6;gis over the Super Tax proposals, the Income Tax proposals, and possibly over the Death Duties.<lb/>
We have heard of dishing the Whigs, but it occurs to me that some of your Lordships may possibly in years to come, if the event should fall out other than we hope and expect, find yourselves whatever occurs in the dilemma of being asked by your own leaders to support what may not differ except possibly in degree from the proposals which are now before you for additional Income Tax and Super Tax and Death Duty. So that really, if we come to look at it, the objection to the Budget, if we are obliged to discuss merits, centres in the land and licensing proposals. Let me say a word about them. Your Lordships will remember the Land Valuation Bill which came before your Lordships' House a couple of years ago. What was the criticism levelled at that Bill? The criticism was, "This is taxation in disguise; this taxation is for no purpose unless it is for the purpose of levying taxation; we will not pass this Bill; it does not disclose your whole plan; we want to see your whole scheme, and then we will consider it."<lb/>
Now, my Lords, you have before you the whole scheme. There is a tax which is proposed to be levied and that tax finds its place, as all taxes do, in the Finance Bill of the year. But now, forsooth, your objection is that valuation, which your Lordships know is a necessary concomitant of any such tax, is attached to this tax, and, on so slender a foundation as that, some critics of the Budget found the accusation that what is called "tacking" is a part of this Budget. Let me say a word about these valuation proposals. It cannot be said that they are new to the country. On four separate occasions before the last General Election they were discussed and divided on in the House of Commons during the time of the late Unionist Administration. On the two latest of these occasions they were carried by majorities in the House of Commons, and on one occasion the seconder of the Motion, that the Bill be read a second time, was a member of the Unionist Party. It is well known that all great municipalities favour these proposals. Do
<col>848</col>
your Lordships think that you have a very strong case in resisting these proposals, a case that will be considered when it is referred to the country by those whose judgment you seek? Will you be able to make out that this is a novel proposal? Will you be able to maintain that it was not before the country at the last Election? I confess I should like a stronger foundation for a great constitutional change such as you now propose.<lb/>
Now, let me say a word about the other land taxes which excite great animosity. I cannot myself believe that your Lordships have realised the import and the scope of these taxes. Certain lands are taxed, but the values accruing to this present hour are all exempt. The value of no land to the date upon which the Bill comes into operation is touched. There is nothing whatever to shake the security of any investments of any property held in land, whether it be held by high or low, from one end of the country to the other. There is another exemption. All improvements which are due to the expenditure of the owner are exempt. Urban land which is built upon and fully developed is exempt. Not a penny more is placed upon urban land by this Budget so long as it is fully developed and built upon. What is proposed is this, and this alone. Starting from the present accrued value and excluding all future value I due to his own outlay, in the case of land which might be developed or is withheld, for whatever reason, from the market, it is proposed that one halfpenny in the pound on capital value shall be the owner's contribution to public funds in respect of that land, and that when he realises it, twenty per cent. of the increment which he then receives shall be contributed to the public funds. Those and those alone are the limits of what is proposed in this Budget in regard to land. "Ah," noble Lords will say&#x2014;and this was implied by the speech of the noble Marquess last night&#x2014;" but you will ruin agriculture." The noble Marquess said, "You have singled out for taxation a form of wealth derived from an enterprise in which the profits are relatively small and uncertain," and from the context, which I have read carefully more than once, because I would be the last to misinterpret the noble Marquess's words, I have no doubt he means agricultural land. My Lords, all agricultural land is exempt from these new burdens. There is not a penny placed upon agricultural land by the Budget, as my
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0431"/>
<col>849</col>
noble friend Lord Ribblesdale pointed out last night. What is more, this Budget, as he also pointed out, is the vehicle of great benefits to the agricultural interest and to the owners of land. The allowance under the Income Tax Schedule for maintenance and repairs which has hitherto stood at the limit of twelve and a-half per cent. is now to be increased to a limit of twenty-five per cent., and in the Development proposals, and in the Road proposals which are linked to this Finance Bill, agriculturists outside this House have recognised this Budget as conveying great benefits to the agricultural industry and to the owners of land.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there are other objections which your Lordships take to this Budget, namely, with regard to the Licensing proposals. I say the case is equally strong with regard to the Licensing proposals as it is in regard to land. It is absolutely impossible to my mind to obtain a secure foundation for so great a constitutional change as is suggested from these Licensing proposals. For twenty-five years, I think the noble Lord on the Woolsack said last night, the question of licensing has been before the public of this country; and however strong the objections of noble Lords, or those otherwise interested in these proposals may be, it would surely have been possible for them to have accepted the proposals as they are, and to have modified them if experience had shown that they were unduly hard, but they are certainly not novel. My Lords, that is the case which the noble Marquess put forward last night for what he has proposed to your Lordships.<lb/>
I should like to be permitted to make two observations upon the situation which is disclosed. In my opinion, the electorate will be right if they take the view which I have already expressed, that the Opposition are the aggressors in this matter. There is in this country a strong sense of fairplay, and I doubt whether your Lordships quite recognise the position of any Liberal Government under the present situation. It has been put before your Lordships in language and with power and force, which I cannot pretend to exercise, by noble Lords who are present on this occasion, that you will never get the people of this country&#x2014;and it will be a sad day for this country if you ever were to get them&#x2014;to fail to recognise the essential unfairness of the position (which we were reminded last night is only
<col>850</col>
of comparatively recent date) under which there is a permanent and overwhelming majority in this House opposed to the Liberal Party. The essential unfairness of the position is that in a system which affects to be just to both Parties, we should go through all the turmoil and expense and labour of a General Election, and in the case of a Conservative victory we should meet with no check and no opposition from your Lordships' House, while in the case of a Liberal victory we should meet with nothing but opposition, as we have met with during the last four years from the same House. I believe it is true that since the year 1864 only one Bill reaching your Lordships from a Government with which you sympathised has been substantially altered. It is certainly otherwise with Liberal administrations. These two subjects which I have mentioned, Land and Licensing, and I might mention many others, have already been the subject of consideration by your Lordships at the instance of this Government, and your Lordships have rejected proposals made immediately after the fresh sense of the country had been taken upon them, and with all the impulse behind them of a new Parliament with an overwhelming majority in support of the Government. In my view, I maintain that the action of your Lordships is a gratuitous attack upon the present situation, a gratuitous extension of what is considered to be the privilege of this House in the Constitution of this country, and an unprovoked attack upon the position of the other House in the Constitution of the country.<lb/>
The second point I would like to mention is this, that once this has been broached, we are done for ever with the old state of things. By refraining from the exercise of the full legal rights of this House, by custom, by convention, by tolerance, by forbearance, by the exercise of sagacity and true public spirit, subordinating in the end, on some occasions not without pressure, other interests, the relations of the two Houses have been left as they are at this moment. The character of this House may alter. Nobody can be blind to the fact that, whereas we have heard little of it in this House, there is a raging, tearing propaganda throughout the country in favour of Tariff Reform. We know enough of Tariff Reform, or of Protection, which is its real name and its operations in other countries, to be apprehensive that if any such system
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0432"/>
<col>851</col>
should ever be established in this country, it would inevitably profoundly alter the character of the constitution of your Lordships' House. There is no elected element in this House, and as I say the difficulties between the two Houses have been got over in the past by mutual forbearance. Whatever may be the outcome of this conflict, I cannot believe that permanently the forty-two millions of the people of this country will allow 600 or more of your Lordships to assume control over the finance and the taxation which they have to bear. A noble Lord last night quarrelled with my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack for saying that any future Liberal Government must secure itself against future dangers which he anticipated. He was rebuked by one of your Lordships for so saying. Your Lordships know perfectly well that no Liberal Government will ever be placed in power in this country, unless it is ready to take such steps as will secure itself in future from the harassing opposition to which the present Government has been subjected. The relations of these Houses&#x2014;if the Constitution is to be thrown into the melting pot&#x2014;must be modified. How and when remains to be seen, but modified they certainly must be. Noble Lords do not contradict that statement.<lb/>
You have a choice of two ways. You have the old way, the traditional way, in consonance with the history of this country, which shows the gradual broadening of the liberties of the people; or you have the violent unconstitutional revolution which you now seek to provoke. My Lords, I prefer the former way. I urge your Lordships to reject this Amendment not because as a member of the Liberal Government I am not ready to take up the challenge&#x2014;I am as ready as any man here, and as strong a Party man as any man here&#x2014;but I do see that in this step there is a grave departure, the consequences of which no man in this House can at present foresee. The noble Earl who opened the debate this afternoon alleged as one of his reasons for withdrawing his support from the noble Marquess that he considered that there might be grave embarrassment to this country in time of war if it were involved in a prolonged and severe constitutional struggle. America, we all know, lost its shipping during the Civil War; and it is common knowledge that we ourselves are still severely handicapped industrially and financially by the leeway which we lost during the South African war.<lb/>
<col>852</col>
And it may be only too true what the noble Earl urged upon your Lordships' attention that the existence of a long constitutional struggle might seriously prejudice this country in time of war if that should come. But there are other interests and there are other developments besides the incidents of war. Two or three years ago only this country was ringing from end to end with criticisms of our educational inefficiency, of the backwardness of this country in regard to education. Your Lordships heard last night from the right rev. Prelate his view of the social condition of the people, and there is no doubt much to be done for the development of the full strength of this country physically as well as mentally. Do you believe you will ever get the attention of this country to self-improvement and to self-development if, for the next five or more years, we are engaged in a prolonged constitutional struggle? My Lords, I believe that the gravity of the issues which we are debating is hidden from us because we do not know what the future may unfold, but I would appeal to your Lordships to consider whether you must take this irrevocable step, not only whether the case is a slender one on which to base what you propose, but whether the penalty may not be one altogether disproportionate to the offence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03419"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with very considerable trepidation and perturbation that I rise to address your Lordships after the terrible philippic which has just been delivered to us. I do not know whether I shall be even able to leave this House in safety. I came here believing that what we were going to discuss was as to whether this Budget was fair to certain classes of persons who are to be taxed under it; but if we are to be guided by the noble Lord, it appears to be that the issue is not fairplay to any taxpayers, but fairplay to any possible Liberal Government. My Lords, if your Lordships dare vote for this Amendment which has been laid before you to-night you have done for ever with the old state of things. What is to follow? The noble Lord does not tell us. He says that such steps will be taken as are necessary. Pray, what steps? Because it would be interesting to know. He said that your Lordships ignore the force of a Resolution of the House of Commons. Pray, what force has a Resolution of the House of Commons over this House? My Lords, when this
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0433"/>
<col>853</col>
matter is taken up in the sense in which the noble Lord proposes it shall be taken up, he will find that what will be required will be an Act of Parliament, and not a mere Resolution of the House of Commons.<lb/>
I do not know that your Lordships will expect me to go at any great length into the speech which we have just listened to. It began by depicting to the House a delightful economic state of things in this country at the present time. The noble Lord, if I remember right, contrasted the public financial issues of the last three years with the public financial issues of the last three years of the administration of the preceding Government. I do not know where he got his figures from, and therefore I am not able to check them, but he said to this side of the House "Remember this, that Consols which stood at 113 fell to eighty-nine." Does not the noble Lord remember that when they were at 113 the interest was two and three-quarters per cent., and with regard to the state of financial affairs at the present time, I must confess that if it ever fell to me to require financial advice, I think I should prefer to consult Lord Revelstoke before I took the opinion of the noble Lord opposite on such matters. But, my Lords, I leave that.<lb/>
The noble Lord made a statement, and said we could contradict it. The question, it seems to me, is if I were going to contradict the noble Lord's statements I do not know which I should begin by contradicting first. What I should like to do would be to have the noble Lord in Committee on the clauses of this Bill, because the language that he used with regard to this Bill I can only say was not consistent with the way in which I have read it. I will just give him a single instance. He said that on land which might be developed a duty of &#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the pound was to be imposed. It is on all undeveloped land, and undeveloped land is stated in the Bill to mean all land which is not covered with buildings. The noble Lord shakes his head. I should be glad if he would correct me if I am wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03420"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Land which has nothing but a purely agricultural value has no taxation upon it. It is only when the land has a prospective building value, and, therefore, in my language, might be developed, that it is subject to this tax.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03421"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I did not know that the noble Lord was speaking
<col>854</col>
of agricultural land only, and moreover, I do not think that la; was. What he was speaking of was the tax on undeveloped land, and undeveloped land, as I said just now, is the land which under the Bill is not covered with buildings. But, as I say, we are not in Committee. I very much wish that we were. The noble Lord and I have had some conversations before, and I daresay we may have some more, but at the present time I am dealing with this Bill, and perhaps the only further objection that I would take to the noble Lord himself is to the statement he made that he was afraid your Lordships do not realise the responsibility which attaches to you for the course that you may take with regard to this Bill. My Lords, I can only say for myself, that having been for a very long time a member of your Lordships' House I have never entered on the consideration of any question with more responsibility. I do not think I have ever entered on the consideration of any question with so deep a sense of responsibility as I have with regard to this matter. Undoubtedly this Bill is a most important Bill. This debate is a most important debate, and I am ready to confess to your Lordships that for a long time after this subject was before the other House of Parliament up to a very recent date, which may be measured only by three or four weeks, I have been anxious to pass the Bill, because I am so well aware of the gravity of the circumstances which must arise if we differ on this point from the House of Commons. I regret to say that after considering every circumstance of the case, after reading, I believe, every debate that took place on it in the House of Commons, I have been reluctantly driven to the conclusion that there is no other course possible except to adopt that which is indicated in this Amendment.<lb/>
This Amendment exactly expresses&#x2014;and I thank the noble Marquess for it personally&#x2014;the attitude of my mind towards this question. I should be sorry to see a word taken from the Amendment or a word added to it. There are no theatrical epithets in it. There is nothing in it which anyone, however malignant his intentions may be, can say contains any threat, veiled or direct, to the House of Commons. It simply expresses the opinion of your Lordships that, you would not be justified in passing this Bill without its being laid before the people. I confess
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0434"/>
<col>855</col>
that I was considerably confirmed in my opinion after very carefully listening to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack last night. What did he say? He admitted that your Lordships have a perfect right to reject this Bill or to dispose of it by means of an Amendment, but what he said was that it would not be constitutional for your Lordships to do it. If that is the only argument that can be brought against the conduct of the Opposition in this matter, there is very little to be said, I am convinced, in favour of that contention. It eases my mind very much indeed. The noble Lord said that there is no precedent for action of this kind on the part of the House of Lords. If there is no parallel and if there is no precedent for the action of the House of Lords in this matter, is there any parallel or is there any precedent for the action of the House of Commons in putting forward such a Budget? This Budget is not a mere statement of the money which is required for the financial conditions of the year. It is rather a Liberal programme. It is a statement of a new policy. It is a policy which would necessarily occupy several years to develop. There are objections to it, and the first I will take to it is&#x2014;I do not know whether this will be grateful to noble Lords opposite&#x2014;that the first and the greatest objection to the Bill is that it is a distinct advance and a long step in the direction of Socialism. I do not make that statement on my own authority. I make it on the authority of the Socialist members of the House of Commons. Here is one. This is what Mr. Barnes said a few days ago in Scarborough:&#x2014;
<quote>"Five years ago the idea of a Liberal Government introducing such a measure as the present Finance Bill would have been deemed outside practical politics. It occurs to me that having regard to the fact that we have got a Budget which does give us a chunk of Socialism we, as consistent Socialists, ought to vote for the Party which is pledged to it."</quote>
Mr. Keir Hardie said on September 20:&#x2014;
<quote>"We are supporting this Budget well knowing that it is the first step towards the ideal which we have in view&#x2014;the absorption by the community for the use of the community of unearned incomes whether derived from land or from other sources."</quote>
This Bill, no doubt, only deals with land. "Other sources" will follow. And Mr. Barnes, speaking on this occasion in the House of Commons, said:&#x2014;
<quote>"This new tax on land, I agree, is to insert the thin end of the wedge. We have the thin end of the wedge driven in this year, and we shall be able to drive that wedge home in future."</quote>
<col>856</col>
I could go on quoting to your Lordships. I have many more of those statements here, I think, however, I have quoted enough. But it is not merely the Socialist members who consider that this Budget is of a Socialist character. It is considered Socialistic by members of Parliament, and by no less a person&#x2014;I do not see him present&#x2014;than one of the newly-made Peers in your Lordships' House. What did Lord Joicey say of this Bill? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"In my judgment the Budget violates many I principles which I have always considered necessary to sound finance and is a complete surrender to Socialism. It sacrifices principles to popularity. It asserts that it is almost criminal to accumulate in order to provide for one's family. It deprives the industrious of the fruits of their industry largely for the benefit of the thriftless and idle. It encourages reckless expenditure by all bodies spending the public money. It will render life to certain individuals almost intolerable by the constant inquisitorial interference of officials."</quote>
Is not that true? I suppose that Lord Joicey is already tainted with that original sin, which, in the opinion of some of your Lordships&#x2014;I do not know whether it includes the noble Lord who has just spoken&#x2014;appertains to this House. Make as many Liberal Peers as you like, but as soon as they come here, they begin to recover their senses &#x0021; Liberal Governments have made many more Peers in the last fifty years than Conservative Governments, and what is the result? That when you introduce some new measure which the people are unable to swallow, they go over to the other side of the House. I very much question, even at this moment, if we could only remove from the House all the noble Lords who sit on this side, and if we could leave the fate of this Budget to be decided by ballot, I am by no means sure that this Budget would pass.<lb/>
There are plenty to be found in the other House of Parliament who do not like this Budget, yet who voted for it. I will be responsible for saying that there are many sitting on that side of the House whom I see before me, who are not enamoured of it. But it is not merely in this House that this Budget is thought Socialistic. Take Sir Robert Perks, whom I suppose noble Lords opposite will deem still a Liberal. How long he may continue to be so it is impossible to say. But listen to what he says:&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not approve of the recent financial proposals of the Government, and as you are aware I did not vote for the Finance Bill. Still less do I
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0435"/>
<col>857</col>
approve of the policy foreshadowed in the recent speeches made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and she President of the Board of Trade."</quote>
Those two speakers are the most important speakers on behalf of the Government, and I say that for this reason, that it is their policy which is always carried out; it is their policy which is embodied in this Bill.<lb/>
Coming to the President of the Board of Trade; it is very difficult to say which members of the Government express the opinions of the Government and which do not. We have tried on one occasion to find out. Your Lordships will remember when the noble Earl the Leader of the House was asked what he thought of the Lord Advocate's opinions that he preserved a discreet silence. I am afraid if I were to ask the noble Earl what he thought of Mr. Lloyd-George's speech at Limehouse, or Mr. Churchill's speech at Leicester, I should not be any more fortunate; and therefore I do not propose to put the question to him. But if Mr. Churchill is to be taken as in any way expounding the views of the Government, he has said, "It is not your money that we are taxing. It is the source it comes from." The question used to be, "How much money have you got?" But the question now is, "How did you get it?" Further than that, he has announced in the other House of Parliament that the policy of His Majesty's Government is to do away with indirect taxation altogether in the end, and to place the whole charge upon capital.<lb/>
Let me say a word or two on this Budget. I do not propose to go into it in detail, but the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack last night said, "There are some taxes on capital and there are some taxes on income." I propose to add further words to that. I propose to say that there are taxes both on capital and on income. Let us take the particular case of undeveloped land. You propose to place upon undeveloped land a duty of &#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the pound. A copper it is called. A copper&#x0021; My Lords, it sounds the sort of thing that is only fit to give to a crossing-sweeper; but examine that copper in the sense in which it will be applied to land after it has been valued by the valuers, who, I may term, will be the Government's &#x00A3;300 to &#x00A3;500 a year men. If, unfortunately, they happen to take it into their heads that land which is only used for agricultural purposes possesses a
<col>858</col>
potential value hereafter for building purposes, they may place upon the land a capital selling value of say &#x00A3;300, and that means 300 halfpennies, or 150 pennies. If you put a Government tax of 150 pence upon land which is very likely let at &#x00A3;2 an acre, then it constitutes a very serious additional burden upon capital which is incapable of realisation at the time at which the charge is imposed. That is the way you place upon land the capital tax up to the time it is finally developed, and what do you say then? Why, on that portion of the land which is developed, you immediately impose an income tax upon the whole created value of the land, and therefore, while you have been taxing the man out of his capital value&#x2014;and mind, if that land is not developed for a considerable number of years, you have taken a considerable portion of the capital value of the land in the form of the tax&#x2014;as soon as it is built upon, you turn upon him and tax him upon the whole realised income. The absurdity and the injustice of a tax of this sort your Lordships have demonstrated in regard to this Budget.<lb/>
There was a similar tax upon undeveloped minerals. What has become of that tax? It has been taken away because it has been found to be so impossible and so unjust. The noble Lord also spoke of duties with regard to licensing, and he said that these additional duties which it is proposed to impose upon that trade were amply justified; and he said that, after all, it was in your Lordships' power to modify those proposals after a year or two. The objection to that statement is that it is not in your Lordships' power to modify those proposals; and moreover, it is a declining trade. It has been stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself that it is a declining trade, and yet he imposes upon it large additional burdens. That trade is very heavily taxed at the present time, and this Bill proposes to place upon it such burdens that within two years time, it may be even in six months time, many of those engaged in that trade will be ruined.<lb/>
The noble Lords who support this Bill say, "We do not in any way interfere with trade." Don't you? I appeal to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, and I know it is an appeal which meets with sympathy, I believe that he prides himself greatly on Free Trade. May I ask him, what does he
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0436"/>
<col>859</col>
think of doubling the Stamp Duty on every transaction connected with land, either for sale or for lease? How does he think&#x2014;or does he think?&#x2014;that it will assist his favourite policy of small holdings? The Government say that they do nothing to interfere with trade. Pray, how about the building trade? The building trade exists almost entirely upon borrowed capital, and upon land which will be described in future as undeveloped land. Do you suppose that men will, in future, lend builders capital at the same rates at which they have lent capital before when they have the prospect of Mr. Lloyd-George before their eyes? And do you suppose that a builder is so likely to build houses when he knows perfectly well that if he makes a profit, twenty per cent. of it will have to go into the Exchequer, and if he makes a loss, that the burden will fall upon his own shoulders? The fact is that if he has two transactions, one of which is a gain and the other is a loss, he is not to be permitted to put one against the other. At all events, if that is the opinion of the noble Lord, it is not the opinion of auctioneers and surveyors and valuers or of any professional men of that description. And remember what is to be the cost of the proposed Government valuation&#x2014;two millions&#x0021; Is there anyone who really has any professional knowledge or experience who will tell you that it can be done for two million pounds? Depend upon it, you will find, in the first place, that it will take a much longer time than you expect; and in the next place the cost will be much nearer twenty millions than two millions.<lb/>
But before I leave this part of the Budget, there is one thing to which I would like to call your Lordships' attention. It is a very important matter because it conveys to my mind an impression of what I may term the levity of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in dealing with these matters. When the Budget was introduced, Mr. Lloyd-George proposed to divert the old Sinking Fund from the purpose to which it is at present applied, namely, that of paying off debt, and to hand it over to a Development Fund. That proposition met with such universal disapproval, that even in the House of Commons nothing more was heard of it. Lord Welby, who was speaking last night, spoke of his experience of different Chancellors of the Exchequer. There were five or six of them, and he said who they were. I should like
<col>860</col>
to know whether any one of those five or six Chancellors of the Exchequer, in pro-posing their Budgets, introduced a proposal so momentous, and dropped it so quickly as has been done in the case of this old Sinking Fund? I have studied the utterances of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer and his writings and his speeches in the House of Commons, and I very much question whether anyone who will follow that same course, will come to a conclusion different from that to which I have been driven, which is, that the present I Chancellor of the Exchequer's powers of vituperation largely exceed his fitness and his power to deal with finance, and that he finds himself more at home on some country platform than in dealing in the House of Commons with important statements relating to finance.<lb/>
Your Lordships will not have forgotten I all that was said about economy when this Government entered into office. Where I have their professions gone? What is their expenditure at the present time? Is it not much larger than that incurred by their predecessors whose extravagance they reviled? And for what are they making these large demands upon the individual? Have they so far changed the whole of their Liberal opinions that they have arrived at the conclusion that the State can take money out of an individual's pocket and spend it for him on a social programme much better than he could spend that money for himself? Noble Lords opposite ask us to pass this Budget now. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack addressed us on that question last night. He said there were only two years more, and that, after all, it is very easy to reverse anything that may be done now. Yes; but if you pass the Second Reading of this Bill, you will have accepted the principle, and will it not be always I thrown in your teeth for all time to come that you had accepted the principle and that therefore it is impossible and unreasonable that you should object to the further development?<lb/>
When one is in a difficulty there are two ways of facing it. You may meet it at once, or you may postpone it. I believe that when trouble is before you, by far the best and decidedly by far the most courageous plan, is to face it at once. We have been told that our future prospects are uncertain. If the popularity of this
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0437"/>
<col>861</col>
Budget is such as has been claimed for it by the last speaker, then the people will say that they wish the Budget to pass, and the Budget will be passed by this House, however bad we may believe it to be. Then the responsibility will rest upon the people. It is the people who will have done it, but when the noble and learned Lord says, "We are the representatives of the people," I should like to ask him, does he believe that the majority in the country in favour of this Budget is as large as the majority who voted in favour of this Budget in the House of Commons.<lb/>
With regard to what fell from the Lord Chancellor last night respecting the consequences which may fall upon your Lordships in case you vote for this Amendment, I believe the Lord Chancellor well understands and appreciates this House. I believe I may also say, without presumption, that this House understands and appreciates the Lord Chancellor; but at the same time I do think that last night&#x2014;I know he meant it well&#x2014;but last night in asking your Lordships whether you had fully measured the consequences of this Amendment, and whether your Lordships were prepared to take the responsibility which would be cast upon you, he addressed an argument to your Lordships which is not an argument at all. At least, it is not an argument which I should have addressed to your Lordships if I were endeavouring to dissuade you from a course which you were likely to take. This House has nothing to do with consequences. Let consequences take care of themselves. The pride of this House is that we are entrusted with a public duty; and in such a case as this it seems to me that our course is so simple and so plain that anyone who runs may understand it. I believe it has been the practice ever since I have been in this House, and I hope and believe it will be always the practice in this House in such cases as the present, to thoroughly consider all the circumstances, to recognise the gravity of such a position as this, to consider what is your public duty as members of the Second Chamber; and then when you have thoroughly made up your minds, to do your duty according to your lights, without any regard to what may thereafter follow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03422"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down accused us on these Benches of being composed partly of
<col>862</col>
faint hearts, and as to at least half the remainder, of being hypocrites. The noble Lord said we should not vote for this Bill if we were not voting in the light of day with our votes recorded. I think I need not trouble to deal with that charge, but it is true undoubtedly that a certain amount of corruption seems to be exercised by the atmosphere of your Lordships' House upon Liberal Peers. I can only hope that I may have succeeded in developing some sort of protective inoculation which will secure me against that corruption. The noble Lord concluded his address by saying that he conceived that the course he was going to take was so clear and plain that anyone who ran might read. I find it hard to reconcile that with an earlier statement in the noble Lord's speech, to the effect that this had given him much anxious consideration, and that until three weeks ago he had not been able to come to a plain conclusion on the matter. At the end of his remarks the noble Lord also referred to the great increase in expenditure, and if I may deal for a moment with this Bill as if it were a Bill which we are able to discuss and deal with effectively&#x2014;although I suggest it is not&#x2014;may I say that I stand perhaps almost alone in objecting to two of the largest items of expenditure, namely, the expenditure upon the Army and the expenditure upon the Navy? The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the other House said that everybody on both sides wanted this expenditure, but was not willing to pay for it. It is perfectly true that there was a great clamour for largely increased expenditure on the Navy, and principally by those who are now reluctant to pay for it. I feel that that may be carried too far, that it is possible to spend upon what is called national defence a larger sum than it is necessary to expend. I think that the fact that these large sums are always available, almost without criticism, and that anyone who criticises them is regarded as failing in his duty as a patriot, tends to extravagance in both these services.<lb/>
Looking at the statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the expenditure on the Army this year was twenty-seven and a-half millions, and on the Navy thirty-five millions, while last year the figures were twenty-seven millions for the Army and thirty-two millions for the Navy. That represents a very considerable increase and that increase in the expenditure on those two services has been going on continuously
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0438"/>
<col>863</col>
and unchecked for many years. It is alleged that it is very easy for anyone to say that you should reduce expenditure on armaments, but that it is impossible to do it. If it is impossible to do it, I think it is a reflection upon the civilisation of the present day. There is to my mind nothing reasonable in nations behaving themselves as if they were two armed desperadoes sitting on a bench, each waiting to see which would make the first move. Surely we can devise a better system than that. But all this expenditure is unproductive, and it tends in some cases to produce, or is likely to produce, the very conflicts which it is said to be designed to avoid. These opinions, I know, are not popular, but I think this is a matter to which some more regard should be had than that lip service which is rendered to it constantly at Hague Conferences and such places. No such objection applies to expenditure on social progress and social amelioration. That expenditure is productive of economy, not only of a direct and tangible character, as is the case with Old Age Pensions, which reduces the amount chargeable to the Poor Bate, but it is still more productive in indirect methods, and in the improvement of the opportunities which the population has of earning money and of being productive. A portion of the large amount which has been spent upon education in this country has been saved in the expenditure upon prisons and lunatic asylums. This directly productive expenditure makes for the benefit of the people, and for the health and the advantage of the nation as a whole. But the expenditure being there, it becomes the duty of another House to provide the money and to find a revenue.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate who spoke last night said he did regard this Budget, which was intended to provide for that expenditure, which in itself was not seriously objected to by anyone, as an oppressive and revolutionary Budget. Is that so? It is oppressive in the sense, of course, that it is always unpleasant to have to pay additional taxes. Neither your Lordships nor the public like it, but the money has to be raised. I have not heard any of the items of expenditure pointed to as items which might be reduced in order to enable less money to be raised, and the method of raising it consists to a very large extent in increasing the yield of already existing taxes, the principle of which is already admitted. That yield has to be increased
<col>864</col>
to provide for these services. There are, of course, limits beyond which taxation may easily become oppressive. I think those limits have been reached to some extent in foreign countries, where taxation does actually harass and hamper industry and trade by its oppressive character. I think no one can honestly say in this country that we are not still very far from those limits. The Stamp Duties have been increased, and one noble Lord asked whether it was consistent with a desire to cheapen the transfer of land to double the duty upon every conveyance. That is a part of the cost of transferring land, but my own experience, and I think the experience of most of your Lordships, will be that the Stamp Duty is the least portion of the cost of transferring land in this country, and that it does not add a very large percentage to the total cost which any person who deals in land has to pay.<lb/>
It is said that the Death Duties are oppressive, and I confess, speaking entirely for myself, that the Death Duties at their lower scale may possibly involve some hardships, but I must say that I contemplate the Death Duties for a millionaire with great satisfaction. Personally, I am very willing to extract from a millionaire a very large sum of money, and when we hear about these duties interfering with people providing for their families, there is some difference between providing for them in the sense of keeping them but of the workhouse and leaving them a million diminished by fifteen per cent. The same observations apply to the Super Tax. The Super Tax is a tax which I do not doubt is unpleasant for those who have to bear it. It adds a very considerable proportion to their burdens but it has not been suggested even, as I understand, in another place, that that tax is in itself an unjust tax, and that it is not a fair thing that those who have larger incomes should contribute a larger sum. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech which opened your Lordships' debate this afternoon by the noble Earl who sits on the Cross Benches, Lord Cromer, who danced a careful sword dance, as it were, amongst these taxes, and ended his observations with a bow to the Tariff Reform Party, offering them his vote in one hand, and a treaty of peace in the other. I did not hear that the noble Lord objected to any of these taxes in themselves, and I heard him deal with the taxes one after the other; but I was somewhat startled to hear him say at
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0439"/>
<col>865</col>
the end of his speech that he would support the Motion before your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03423"><member>SEVERAL NOBLE LORDS</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03424"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: Well, he said he would abstain from voting, but I did not quite gather why he was unable to support the Budget. The noble Lord concluded by saying that he regarded this Budget as a dangerous one, and that he could not support it. I was not able; either to follow the argument which he addressed&#x2014;although it is a matter rather for other people's concern than ourselves&#x2014;that a vote given to a Tariff Reformer was not a vote given to Tariff Reform. It is true, if I may take another illustration, that a vote given to a drunkard is not a vote given to drink, but a vote given to a man in the liquor interest, who stood in the liquor interest and was going to defend it, I should have thought was a vote given to the liquor interest. If you give a vote to a man who is supporting Tariff Reform and who says he is going to support and stand for it, that constitutes a vote for Tariff Reform. That is a matter, no doubt, which the noble Earl and those who agree with him will settle for themselves. The position of the unfortunate people in the opposite Party who find themselves Free Traders is already so unpleasant that one would not wish to aggravate it.<lb/>
Then I take another of the taxes. We have an increase in the Licence Duties, and on that you are told that those taxes are not to be imposed upon the trade, partly because they are oppressive, but partly because more or less similar proposals have been presented to you before in the form of a Licensing Bill. Your Lordships refused to agree with that Licensing Bill, and you complain now that you find the same taxes in the Budget. Why you should think that it is not a fair thing to increase existing taxes which are imposed upon the liquor trade I do not understand. You may think that your Lordships' House is being jockeyed out of its rights by haying this matter inserted in the Finance Bill, but I do not think anyone has gone so far as to say that the Licence Duties in the Finance Bill constitute tacking. That would be an impossible charge. I admit I am not qualified to discuss with any degree of fairness the taxes upon liquor. I regard the liquor trade as being the curse of the country.<lb/>
<col>866</col>
I regard the sellers of drink as being the licensed sellers of poison, and on that matter I confess I am a fanatic, and I am not able to discuss it with any degree of fairness. It seems to me that no restrictions that could be put upon them would be too great, and that the existing system of tied houses, by which persons are forced to drink more than they want to in the interests of the landlord, is a system that ought to be put an end to, confiscation or not, at the earliest possible moment. These are views which even the corrupting I influence of your Lordships' House has not succeeding in removing, but rather in strengthening and accentuating.<lb/>
Then we are told by a great many speakers that, apart from the taxes altogether, the objection to the Budget as a whole is that it is a, Socialistic Budget, and that it constitutes the beginning of Socialism. The noble Earl who last spoke, Lord Camperdown, quoted several remarks from Socialistic leaders to show that they accepted it as only an instalment of Socialism. For a great many years I have always indignantly denied that I was a Socialist, but quite recently I received some literature and an invitation to join the Anti-Socialist Union. I confess that after I had read that literature, I conceived that I must be a Socialist, for I was entirely unable to agree with any of their propositions, and therefore if the Budget is Socialistic in that sense, then I am a Socialist and support the Budget on that ground. The Liberal Party is not Socialistic. There is no question, I think, about that. The Liberal Party is still the support of individualism and of individualism in property, but the State as a whole and both Parties in the State are obviously, to any fair-minded observer, becoming more Socialistic in this sense, that things are being done now by the community which were before left to private enterprise, and we have common action in a great many things in which we did not have it before. I think both Parties have taken to that course. These social services, as the right rev. Prelate said last night, cost money, and in the course of finding money for these objects there will undoubtedly be hardships upon individuals, and complaints from those who have property, and who find it much more heavily taxed than it used to be. I am afraid that that is an almost necessary incident in anything in the nature of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0440"/>
<col>867</col>
sort of transition state which I venture to I think we are now in. No great Party in the State has adopted the communal ideal at present, but both have done things which savour of Socialism and Communism, and in the transition a great many social services are being put on the rates and taxes which before were left to private enterprise, and which necessarily increase individual burdens.<lb/>
In this Finance Bill the Chancellor of the Exchequer has endeavoured to put in the form of legislation a large number of ideals, many of them ideals of social progress with which few of your Lordships would be willing to express your disagreement. There is an inherent difficulty in translating social ideals into legislation, and putting them into the text of a Finance Bill. It is said that the Bill has shown signs of hasty draftsmanship. It is true that it has been much amended, but it is a vast and complex Bill, and we all know from the ordinary sources of public information that it received great consideration before it was introduced, and we certainly know that it has received very great and very careful consideration since it was introduced. In the face of that, and in the face of the majority by which it passed the other House, are you not taking rather a strong course in saying when it comes here that it is hasty and ill-considered legislation, and that you are not justified in passing it until the country has been consulted?<lb/>
Can your Lordships provide an alternative? None has been put forward officially in this debate. None is before your Lordships' House, and I have not yet seen a constructive alternative with which you are going to the country to raise this money. One of the ideals which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has set before him, and which I believe has been realised in this Bill, I will quote to you in his own words. I will quote it from the Limehouse speech. It is not the portion which has attracted most attention possibly, but it is a portion which I think is, perhaps, even more important. The right hon. gentleman said that when he took charge of the National Exchequer at a time of great difficulty he made up his mind, in framing the Budget, that at any rate no cupboard should be the barer, and that no lot would be harder for his Budget. Is that not the principle that has been kept in view in this Budget&#x2014;that the taxes shall be nut upon
<col>868</col>
those shoulders that are best able to bear them?<lb/>
We had yesterday a very interesting speech from the noble Lord, Lord Revel-stoke, than whom nobody could give us a better picture from the financial point of view. The noble Lord need not in the least have been afraid that he did not make himself perfectly clear to your Lordships. He gave us a picture from the City point of view which was perfectly clear and perfectly intelligible. He told us how capital was doing this and that, how people who had money to invest were asking this and that, how capital was leaving the country, and how there was a feeling of insecurity. The noble Lord showed us all the columns of the Temple of Mammon&#x2014;<i>totus teres atque rotundus</i>&#x2014;with its swept courts, its strong walls and protecting fences, and asked whether it was right that anything should be done to disturb the security of this temple. Are you justified, he asked, in doing this by your Budget? That explained to me more fully than I have ever understood before why it is that the City as a whole is always found in the rear of social progress and advance, because although the view was clear cut, it was a view which was obviously a narrow and a limited one. It was cut off at one point. It by no means embraced the country or the inhabitants of this country as a whole.<lb/>
To some of us, hypocrites though the noble Lord may think us, there also arose a vision, not only of these slightly-disturbed financiers, of these unfortunate people who make a quarter per cent. less on their money, and whose securities have fallen by so much per cent., but of those people who are to be seen homeless every night on the Embankment, of those who are unemployed up and down the country, of those who are starving, of those who are being sweated and are unable to compete on fair terms for a livelihood in the labour market of the world; and some of us felt that a slight disturbance in the temples of high finance is worth while if something is done to alleviate the lot of those unfortunate people, and to bring stability and enjoyment of life to a larger portion of the population of this country. The noble Lord ventured to doubt whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer understood the meaning of the word credit. May I venture to doubt whether the spirit of the City which was there expounded quite understands what some of us mean by
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0441"/>
<col>869</col>
social service and social improvement? There is as much to be learned on one side as on the other.<lb/>
I must pass over entirely some of the taxes in this Bill which I should like to speak upon, because I do not agree with the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Cromer, in saying that our object is to discuss the fairness of the Budget. I think that is exactly what is not our object. Our object is rather to discuss whether your Lordships' House is justified or is right in the course which it is now proposed to take. There is no precedent for such a course. Your Lordships have been told that the course is not illegal. And no more it is. You have been told that it is unconstitutional. Well, we have no written Constitution, but we have a Constitution which is limited and guarded by custom, and which has hitherto proved sufficient to meet the strains which have been put upon it. I am no friend of written Constitutions. In America, where they have a written Constitution, you find it is being constantly interpreted there by the letter of the law. The spirit dies and the letter remains, and it is so interpreted, and there is a constant series of evasions. In this country, the greater part of our government rests upon understandings and conventions and customs, which have almost a greater force than any written Statute which has ever been placed on the Statute Book. Those conventions and customs are being disregarded by the Amendment which is now before the House. Your Lordships are seeking to destroy, and assuming the right to destroy, the work of an arduous year, and the work of the large majority in the elected and representative House, which has admittedly the right to deal with finance; and it seems to me from some of the speeches to which I have listened, that you are destroying it very lightheartedly, and without having fully considered the consequences.<lb/>
You say you are not afraid of the consequences. Well, I should hope not. The aristocrats in the Reign of Terror were not afraid of the guillotine, but the knife fell none the less, and the action which your Lordships are now taking is, I think, the beginning of the end of these understandings in our Constitution and between both Houses. Your Lordships have inaugurated a revolution. You have put an end to these understandings and made them impossible. Can any of us doubt, whichever
<col>870</col>
side succeeds at the next election, that sooner or later there will come a readjustment which will leave this House powerless, as we on this side of the House think, for evil? Personally, I do not regret it. From my point of view this House has always been in favour of reaction. Its history stands out as a constant barrier to progress. It is represented sometimes as a deliberative and revising Chamber which provides a very useful check upon measures that come from another place, and licks them into shape or defers them. But this House has done much more than that. It has delayed measures of reform of every character, and dealing with every kind of subject. It has delayed and destroyed them again and again. Its history is a record of interference with the course of progress. It is said that progress may be too rapid without the check of this House. That may be so. Too rapid, no doubt, for some of the faint hearts to whom the noble Lord opposite referred. Too rapid, perhaps, for some even on this side of the House, but we live nominally, and your Lordships will find we live really, under the control of the democracy of this country, and I think your Lordships will find that that democracy intends to govern itself, and intends to have the expression of its will obeyed and observed.<lb/>
In the action which it is now proposed to take, I say you are putting an end to all possibility of these understandings subsisting in future, and all possibility of any useful check being exercised by this House. If any useful check has been exercised in the past, your Lordships will not have the chance of exercising it again. You are introducing a new era; you are, in fact playing into the hands of those whom you say you are afraid of&#x2014;the democracy, and giving it the opportunity which it has long wanted. This conflict has threatened for some time, and few of us on this side of the House will regret that the conflict should come, and that it should be at an end. People in the country do not know, and even in the course of the election will not learn, how constantly the influence of your House has been exercised against progress Not merely have Bills of first class rank, to which attention has been called, been thrown out, but it is in the consideration that has to be given to meet your Lordships' views and in other ways that the country is unaware of how constantly legislation has been cheeked. I shall rejoice to see the veto of this House swept away. To my

mind that is the only good thing we can hope for from the Amendment which has been put before us. Your Lordships have inaugurated a course of events of which you cannot foresee the exact termination. I welcome it because I believe its ultimate effect will be to make for progress, but your Lordships who have initiated it will not all be pleased with the ultimate result.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03425"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just spoken accused noble Lords on this side of the House of having asked for expenditure that they were not willing to pay for, and towards the conclusion of his speech the noble Earl implied that the opponents of this Budget had no conception of the meaning of the words "social service" and "social reform." I entirely repudiate both those assertions. This argument has been used frequently outside this House, but it has not yet been used within these walls. I do not think a single speech has been made on this side of the House which could in any way justify either of those assertions. I do not yield to the noble Earl either in the knowledge of the meaning of the words "social service," or in an appreciation of the meaning of those words, and in the only part of this Bill to which I shall refer at all closely, I hope I shall be able to show him that if we attack the proposals which it contains, it is only because we believe that there are alternative methods of meeting this necessary expenditure. There is another theory which has been constantly used outside this House, but which I do not think has been used in the course of this debate so far, and that is the suggestion that this House cannot be trusted to discuss fairly or impartially those portions of the Finance Bill which refer to land, or liquor licences, and that any criticisms which might be offered upon either of those two sections of the Bill must be biassed by self-interest. I should like to ask why in politics it should be considered fair and legitimate to attack certain interests against which you are known to have political prejudices, and why it should be so improper and so wrong for the interests which are so attacked to defend themselves. No one, I think, doubts that the Government have a political prejudice against those who are engaged in the liquor trade, and also against those who are owners of land. They do not deny it themselves.<lb/>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his
<col>872</col>
" half-pantaloon and half-highwayman's style," as Lord Ribblesdale called it, in defending this Budget spoke about land-owners as "blackmailers," and declared that his Budget and his policy were going to provide "a day of reckoning" for brewers and capitalists <i>et hoc genus omne</i>. If labour legislation is introduced into the House of Commons, it is not considered improper for the representatives of that class who are going to benefit by that legislation to speak upon it, and even to propose Amendments which will increase the benefits which they are going to receive from it. And if those interests were attacked by any Government in power, do you suppose that they would not take the opportunity to defend themselves? The fact is that those who seek to prejudice the actions and opinions of opponents of the Finance Bill by accusations of self-interest, are really advancing one of two theories&#x2014;either that legislation which benefits any particular class or interest may be discussed by the class or interest so benefited, but that legislation which has an injurious effect may not be discussed by the class which is going to suffer; the other theory is that what is proper for one class is highly improper for another. What is permissible for a Trade Unionist to do, say, in the case of labour legislation is not permissible for a landlord, and what is right and proper for Nonconformists is altogether wrong and improper for the Established Church.<lb/>
Against both those theories I protest most emphatically, and I assert, whether the action this House is going to take is right or wrong, wise or unwise, it is, at any rate, dictated by just as strong a regard for the public interest as that which animates either the Government or the House of Commons. If this House is critical of this Bill, it is not merely because it is going to affect the pockets of noble Lords. It is not only upon ground of self-interest. It is true&#x2014;I am not prepared to deny it&#x2014;that the Land Clauses and the Licensing Clauses in this Bill do arouse a degree of hostility which is not created by any other clauses in the Bill; but it is not because the effect of those taxes is going to fall upon members of this House. We shall bear the burdens of the Income Tax and the Death Duties and other portions of the Finance Bill, but there is something inherent in these two sections of the Bill which roused greater hostility
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0443"/>
<col>873</col>
than the other sections, and I think I might say, without fear of contradiction, that if those two sets of clauses had not been included in the Bill, the Amendment of the noble Marquess would never have been put on the Paper. But if it be true, why is it? It is because those clauses more than any other parts of the Bill bear unmistakable evidence of having been actuated by political rather than by financial reasons. I look to the speeches by which these sections in particular are defended, and the "envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness" shown in the speeches in defence of these clauses bear unmistakable proof that they have been drafted, not for financial needs, but in order to secure political objects at the expense of certain interests against which the Government has a political prejudice. There is another feature which is common to these clauses, and it is that in both cases, in order to raise these taxes, you are going to set up a costly system of valuation which will eat up all the revenue that will be derived from them for some years to come.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, in moving his Amendment last night, showed very clearly how this would happen with regard to the land taxes. I want to say one word in proof of the same thing, and in regard to the same clauses which deal with the imposition of the Licence Duties. The duties imposed in the First Schedule of the Bill amount to fifty per cent. of the annual value of the licence, and at the present moment, so far as this year is concerned, the annual value of the licence bears no relation to the alcoholic trade which is done in a particular house, and therefore, the result is that these proposals will fall with great severity upon all public houses which have costly and commodious premises, and will leave practically untouched premises which are poor, although the trade in the latter may be great. I could make it clear by a great many instances.<lb/>
I shall only quote two as an illustration of the argument I am advancing. They are both taken from facts within my own knowledge. There is a working man's public-house which does a trade in alcoholics amounting to &#x00A3;2,900 a year. The duty imposed upon that house under this Bill would be only &#x00A3;24, or 2<i>d</i>. in the pound on the sales. On the other hand, a country
<col>874</col>
inn in the same county which does a large non-alcoholic trade, and in which non-alcoholic articles are of more importance than the trade in alcohols, will pay a duty of 2<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. in the pound. This instance which I will give to the House is even more striking. It is that of a house in which the premises are very poor indeed, but it I is situated in a district which enables it to earn annually no less than &#x00A3;6,000 from the sale of alcoholic liquor. The duty on that house would be only &#x00A3;25 a year, while a commercial hotel in the same district, which cost many thousands of pounds to build, and where the alcoholic trade only amounts to &#x00A3;450 a year, would pay a duty of &#x00A3;150. In one case the duty would be equivalent to a tax of about 1&#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the pound, and the other equivalent to a tax of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in the pound. That policy is altogether indefensible. What is the good of talking about the shoulders best able to bear it, and the only alternative being to tax poverty? I am objecting to these taxes, not because they are placed upon the liquor trade, for I think when a largo sum of money has to be raised that trade might quite fairly be expected to pay I its proper share. But I am objecting to the system under which these taxes are to be imposed, and I say, so far as this Bill is concerned, these taxes are illogical, they are unjust in their incidence, they are bad finance and bad temperance reform. They are indefensible, and the Government themselves have not attempted to defend them. I know I shall be told that this is only a temporary measure, and that the whole assessment will be altered in the course of next year. I should like to ask why a system so utterly indefensible from any point of view, should be established for twelve or six months, or even for any time.<lb/>
Let me deal with the proposal which is to take place under Clause 44. Under that clause a new system of valuation is to be set up, according to which the annual value of the licence is to be calculated on the basis which was adopted in the Act of 1904, for the purpose of assessing value for compensation, and the effect will be to make the annual value of the house bear some relation to the trade carried on in the premises, and will consequently remove the objections which I have just made. But that system is open to the same objection as was made by the noble Marquess last night when speaking of the land valuation proposals of the Government. It will be extremely
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0444"/>
<col>875</col>
costly. It will lead to no end of controversy and friction, and it will take many years to carry out. Anybody who has had experience of the process of assessing compensation under the Act of 1904: will know that it is a matter which bristles with difficulties and controversies and complexities. But the Government proposed to do this, not for one particular house at a time, in a particular district, where all the circumstances are known, but for all the public-houses in the country at one given moment. This will involve an examination of the conditions of tenure, locality, trade and so forth of 90,000 public-houses. The valuation of these public-houses will cost considerably over a million of money, and will take a great many years to carry out. No Government which was actuated simply by financial considerations would ever have dreamt of putting forward such a proposal. Even from their own standpoint&#x2014;even if they desire to raise a sum out of the liquor trade, this costly valuation is altogether unnecessary.<lb/>
The imposition of a simple poundage duty upon the liquor purchases which are made in the premises where liquor is sold, whether clubs or public-houses, would yield the Government all the revenue which it requires. It would save friction and controversy; and, above all things, it would save considerable expense. I gather that the Government estimate they will receive &#x00A3;4,000,000 from their licence duties, and a duty of 1<i>s</i>. in the pound on all purchases of beer and spirits alone would yield &#x00A3;3,850,000 or &#x00A3;150,000 short of the sum they are expecting to raise, without touching wine at all. That is a perfectly practical proposal. It has been adopted by the Government in Clause 48 of the Bill in dealing with clubs, and the only reasons why this system of duties is not applied to public-houses are political and not financial reasons. I am amazed that a Government which came into office pledged to check the extravagant expenditure of its predecessors, should go out of its way, when it is in financial difficulties, and has a large sum of money to raise, to incur an extra liability of at least &#x00A3;3,000,000, and probably a great deal more, to set up this unnecessary system of valuation both in regard to licences and the land taxes. I repeat that these clauses of the Bill which refer to land and licences are not <i>bona fide</i> financial propositions at all, and I presume that that is the reason why we are asked
<col>876</col>
to take this unusual and unprecedented step of referring this Bill to the will of the people.<lb/>
I think I have said enough to show why I am not prepared to vote for this Bill If it were an ordinary legislative measure, I should have no hesitation in voting for the Amendment of the noble Marquess, but it is not such an ordinary legislative measure. In my opinion the difference between the action which this House proposes to take in the case of an ordinary measure of legislation and the Finance Bill is so great that I hardly feel prepared to follow the course which has been recommended to this House. In my view the action which we are asked to take, to reject a Finance Bill, and thereby to refuse Supplies to the Government of the day, and bring about an immediate Dissolution&#x2014;such a course as that is so unusual and so serious that in my opinion it could only be justified by one condition, and that condition is, that there should be unmistakable proof that the country will have nothing to do with the Bill. Now, my Lords, in the present case I do not find that that proof is forthcoming, or that that condition is fulfilled. On the contrary, I believe that the Budget of the year has found more favour with the electors of this country than any other proposals which the Government has put forward since it came into office. Considering the misleading manner in which this Bill has been defended, both by Liberal speakers and by the Liberal Press, that does not seem very surprising. If the people are in favour of this Budget, it is because they are constantly told that the only alternative is between a Government on the one hand anxious to tax the superfluities of the rich, and the Opposition on the other hand dying to tax the necessities of the poor. I consider that last statement a gross perversion of the truth, but so long as that fiction is going about, it is idle to suppose that this Finance Bill is odious to the people of this country, or that the demand for its rejection is emphatic or widespread.<lb/>
I say nothing about the financial difficulty which will be created. The noble Marquess said last night in regard to the financial situation which would be created by the adoption of his Amendment that he preferred the temporary chaos and confusion to the permanent confusion and chaos that would
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0445"/>
<col>877</col>
follow if this Bill were allowed to puss into law. I agree with him, but is it certain that we are taking the best course to prevent that permanent evil which the noble Marquess desires to avoid? If I were convinced that the rejection of this Bill was demanded by the people of this country, and that the result of the election which will follow from the action of this House would put an end to this Bill, then I should be ready to follow the course which we are asked to adopt by the noble Marquess. But it is because I feet grave doubts on that point, and because, on the contrary, I feel that we are taking the very worst possible course in the circumstances, that I prefer to follow the line of action recommended by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Cromer.<lb/>
I do not want to dwell upon my difference with noble Lords who sit on this side of the House, because I consider that any such difference of opinion is completely overshadowed by the far larger issues which lie in the background. Like the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, I have little faith in the alternative proposal recommended by noble Lords on this side of the House, but I am glad that the noble Earl made a strong appeal in the course of his speech to Unionist Free Traders throughout the country. Whether the action which this House is going to take is wise or unwise, there can be no difference of opinion as to what will be the consequences. We are faced now with a struggle which may be long or short, but which, while it lasts, will overshadow all other considerations. We have against us a Government which openly avows its intention of destroying the constitutional position of this House. In such a struggle as that, there is only room for two sides, and therefore, I say I welcome the words spoken by the noble Earl. He was taken to task by Earl Russell for saying that a vote given to a Tariff Reformer was not necessarily a vote given to Tariff Reform. Earl Russell said he could not understand what was meant by such words. I understood those words perfectly well; and what they meant, I believe, was that, whatever our views might be upon the questions of Free Trade or Tariff Reform, when face to face with a great constitutional struggle such as this, it was, in his view, necessary to sink all minor differences of opinion on fiscal or other matters, and take our stand in the fighting line in defence of the Constitution. I feel every one who is
<col>878</col>
not prepared to establish permanently what the noble Marquess referred to last night as described by Oliver Cromwell "the horridest arbitrariness that ever existed in the world" must come forward and step into the fighting line at the present moment.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Russell, said he did not regret this struggle. He welcomed it, and said he was glad of it. I do not agree with him. I regret, infinitely regret, the struggle upon which we are now entering. I see that it is bound to stand in the way, for a great many years to come, of a great deal of very useful work, even if it has not the effect of possibly embarrassing us in our relations abroad. I regret that this struggle should have come; but I disclaim all responsibility for having brought that struggle about. The noble Lord who spoke from the Government Benches just now, declared that that struggle was directly sought by noble Lords on this side of the House. He seems to forget that this struggle was threatened. He seems to forget that the change in the constitutional position of this House was embarked upon by the present Government long before the financial proposals of the year were introduced. As I say, I disclaim all responsibility for that struggle. I regret that it should have come about, but since we are face to face with it at the present moment, I hope that all those who since the death of the late Duke of Devonshire have looked to the noble Earl on the Cross Benches to lead them in their opinions, will bear in mind the words which he addressed to them to-night, and irrespective of their opinions on fiscal or other matters, and whatever their differences may be in other directions, will, in the course of the struggle upon which we are now embarking, come forward and fight in defence of the Constitution of this country.</membercontribution></p>

Therefore it might be well in future if your Lordships allowed a little longer adjournment for the dinner hour. Being an old <i>habitu&#x00E9;</i> of the House I do not feel that cold chill that runs through a young
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0446"/>
<col>879</col>
member in addressing a House with empty Benches. I need hardly say that I rise to endorse with all the force I have at command the Amendment which has been moved by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. He stated in a most statesmanlike manner, if I may use the expression, the reasons why your Lordships should not allow the Finance Bill that has come up to your Lordships' House to be passed without consulting the people of the country as to what their views and ideas are upon the subject. It has been stated very frequently both before this debate was inaugurated and since, that the action of my noble friend Lord Lansdowne was absolutely without precedent in proposing that the Budget Bill should be submitted to the judgment of the country before it was passed by your Lordships' House. Whether that is without precedent or not I raise no argument. We believe it absolutely without precedent that such a Bill should be submitted to your Lordships' House. This I do say, that the Bill which has been sent up from the House of Commons is absolutely without precedent. Your Lordships have never been asked before to pass a Budget Bill based on principles so absolutely contrary to the Constitution and the desire of the country on this subject.<lb/>
I venture to think that the introduction of this Finance Bill is, in the first place, absolutely unconstitutional. I have looked up, as I dare say many of your Lordships have, various precedents, and I have never yet been able to find that a Budget introduced into the House of Commons and sent to your Lordships' House has been of a character such as that which is now submitted for your Lordships' consideration. I venture to say, therefore, that the Bill now before us is absolutely unconstitutional. The Budget Bill, or the Finance Bill, whichever you like to call it, when it comes up to your Lordships' House has always been founded on the principle that money is required for the time, and the time only, to meet the requirements of the expenditure of the country, and never has it gone beyond that.<lb/>
This is an unconstitutional Bill because there have been "tacked on" a number of Bills which your Lordships have considered in this House and which you have rejected. So far as we can gather, whenever an opportunity has been given to the country to
<col>880</col>
speak on this subject the rejection of those Bills has not been unpopular. On the contrary the rejection of those Bills has been approved as shown at by-elections which have taken place, and it has been proved that your Lordships in rejecting those Bills have been far more in touch with the feeling of the country than are the members of His Majesty's Government. I have always understood that when the Budget has been introduced into the House of Commons and sent up to your Lordships' House it is for the purpose of obtaining revenue and revenue only. I do not think any noble Lord opposite will contradict me when I say that this Bill is not a Bill really for the purpose of obtaining revenue for the expenditure of the country, which I know is large. But this Bill had tacked on to it those Bills to which I have alluded. Consequently I say the procedure is absolutely unconstitutional, and being unconstitutional it is not a question as to whether your Lordships reject or accept the Budget, but, in the words of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, it is a question for the country to decide whether the Budget should be accepted or rejected. Now the Budget Bill as it comes up to your Lordships' House contains a certain number of Bills which your Lordships have already rejected, and I maintain that that is absolutely unconstitutional. In addition to that we find there is also in the Budget a system of taxation which is to be imposed, as my noble friend Lord Lytton, who spoke last, said, on a certain class of the community whom the Government at the present day regard as hostile to themselves and antagonistic to their political views. Now the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, has alluded, as a great number of those who addressed your Lordships have alluded, to the manner in which this Budget Bill was introduced to attack certain owners of property, who as I have stated are hostile to the views of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
First of all I wish to deal, I hope not at too great length, with the question of the Land Tax. Land has been taxed in a manner that I think all unprejudiced people will say is entirely out of proportion to the amount the owners of land should be taxed. Why is that? The noble Lord told us. It is because the owners of land are supposed to be not altogether friendly but hostile to the views of the Government. In the few moments I propose to devote to the question I will deal with that part of it. In the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0447"/>
<col>881</col>
Budget Bill sent up to us we find that taxation is imposed on the increasing value of land, and land has been singled out by the Government for this increase. I would like to ask the noble Lord who follows me why has land been singled out for this increased taxation? That it has been singled out I do not think anybody will deny; but why has it been singled out when we think of the enormous amount of property unconnected with land which it is not proposed by this Budget Bill to tax? We know full well that a great amount of money is invested which brings in dividends on shares. Why has this not been selected to be taxed equally? I do not think any member of His Majesty's Government can show me that the increment of land is so far above the increment earned by other investments. But land is selected, and land only; and undoubtedly whatever the revenue may be it will, as has been shown by speakers who have preceded me, be swallowed up in the collection and valuation expenses.<lb/>
Therefore, I venture to say the object of this Budget is not only unconstitutional but it is unjust, and, if I may use the expression, it is vindictive towards a certain class of the community who are hostile to His Majesty's Government. I know there are some who hold optimistic views supporters of the Government who declare that it is possible out of this taxation of land to produce the amount of money which it is hoped will accrue. I shall be glad to hear from those who will follow me whether that optimistic view is absolutely correct. I should like to hear whether the permanent officials of the Treasury, who are naturally reticent with regard to the views they hold, believe that the large amount of money which is required to meet this extra expenditure is to be made out of the taxation of land. I cannot help thinking that His Majesty's Government do not for one moment expect to make a large amount of revenue out of the taxation of land. I think, on the contrary, that they believe that by taxing undeveloped land they will bring into the market a large amount of land which at the present moment is what is called "held up," or is not open to the public for purchase. If that is the case the whole argument for its inclusion in the Budget falls to the ground. A Budget to my mind, is not supposed to bring into the market land, but only to produce from that land the amount of money that is required to meet the exigencies of the moment. Therefore, I say if that is the
<col>882</col>
case the Government by taxing land are not endeavouring to bring in revenue, but they are endeavouring, contrary to every principle on which a Budget should be brought in, to force land into the market to be sold at a price and to be developed. If that be the case, and I maintain it is, it must be obvious that the tax can only carry out the intention of the Government as long as the yield of that land is small. If a large revenue is derived from that land which I maintain the object of the Government is to force into the market then the purpose of the Government entirely fails, because the land that is to be taxed, being incapable of development, is taxed beyond its value. If that land is developed to avoid the tax then I say the revenue under the Land Tax cannot possibly be large. I hope I have made myself clear. I should like whoever follows me to explain that to us.<lb/>
What is the reason for taxing landowners? The answer to that question, to my mind, is very simple. It is that at the present moment the Government have but one idea in their minds. It is not to collect revenue from the tax they propose to impose upon land, but simply for the purpose of nationalising the land in future. And they desire, as far as I can gather from the Budget proposals, to have the owner of land replaced by the State. If that is the case, I should like to have an answer to it when I sit down. If that is what they want then the Budget, as at the present moment before your Lordships' House, is the first step in that direction, because the Government have insisted that there should be a valuation of all land, whether those lands come under taxation or whether they are exempted from taxation by Statute. As far as I can gather, the main principle of the Budget Bill with regard to land is that there should be a valuation and a valuation only. Valuation is their first principle. Revenue for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the country is a very secondary one. Therefore I cannot but think that this question of the valuation of all classes of land, whether it comes under the Budget or is exempted by Statute, is not really for revenue but merely the paving of the way for the nationalisation of land. I may be asked why I make that statement. I make it because I have read an article by the Chancellor of the Exchequer which appeared in the <i>Nation</i>, a few weeks ago. There the Chancellor of the Exchequer states:&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0448"/>
<col>883</col>
<quote>"The Budget campaign must be the beginning and not the end of the Liberal effort in land reform. The new State valuation must be the basis of all plans of communal purchase. On this basis municipalities ought to buy the land which is essential to the development of their towns; and the State could also buy up land necessary to the policy of re-creating rural life in Britain."</quote>
Well, that to my mind, is simply making the position of the owner of land an impossible one. They propose under this Bill virtually to place on owners a tax of, I may say, a ruinous character, so that eventually, if we read aright the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the owner of land will be so over-taxed, out-taxed out of possession of his property, that be will be glad then to go to the State and ask the State to buy him out on any terms they choose to offer. That is the policy of His Majesty's Government as I read it in their Budget at the present moment.<lb/>
But, my Lords, that is not a new policy. It was the policy introduced by Mr. Henry George many years ago, and it has never been accepted or taken up by the people of this country. Consequently when we hear that it is proposed to extract money for revenue purposes, and revenue purposes only, out of land, I venture to ask how do the Government reconcile the question of revenue from land with these proposals, which are nothing more or less than the proposals of Mr. Henry George many years ago? The Bill, we are told, is only a Finance Bill. To my mind the Land Clauses of this Finance Bill are, in effect, simply this: "How can we get rid of the landowners?" And if we want anything more to prove that, we have only got to read the speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Limehouse and Newcastle. I do not know whether the noble Earl opposite who is taking notes will endorse those speeches, but we must realise that the one idea of this Budget Bill is to carry out the proposals made by Mr. Henry George some years ago, proposals which have never been confirmed or assented to by the people of this country. Therefore I say with regard to the question of land the Finance Bill is merely a matter of form. It is not really a Finance Bill. What the Government are considering is how they can get rid of the landowners and how they can nationalise the land.<lb/>
I pass on to another proposal which I
<col>884</col>
think is unjust, as I think the Land Clauses are vindictive. I mean the proposals in the Budget Bill with regard to what are called the Licensing Taxes. I say at once that I think the Licensing Taxes are not only unjust but absolutely vindictive. In all probability noble Lords opposite and their supporters will deny that statement and declare that they are only introduced for the purposes of revenue. But I should like to ask them how they reconcile that view with the statements made by some of their leading colleagues in another place. I find Mr. McKenna, speaking at Manchester on December 4, said: "Our hearts are filled with rage at the loss of the Licensing Bill." I find Mr. Pease, the Chief Whip of the Party opposite, said "He imagined the people would expect that Mr. Lloyd-George would cause the abolition of redundant licences by placing taxation on them so that the people might get back their own." It seems to me it is the Government who appear to be getting back their own on the publicans for their refusal to be ruined by the Licensing Bill which your Lordships rejected in this House. Is it possible, after reading those speeches and carefully considering them, that His Majesty's Government fancy that the people of this country can be so fooled and beguiled as not to realise that within a very short time&#x2014;comparatively a few weeks&#x2014;of these, as I call them, vindictive speeches being made there is introduced into the Budget Bill clauses to deal, as they had told us they would do, vindictively with those people who opposed them with regard to the Licensing Bill?<lb/>
I cannot for a moment believe that the people of this country, who have endorsed, whenever the opportunity has arisen, the action of your Lordships' House in rejecting the Licensing Bill, will agree that the object of His Majesty's Ministers in introducing these clauses in a fresh Bill&#x2014;after the vindictive statements made&#x2014;was merely in the interests of reducing drunkenness and promoting temperance, and not because they are vindictive to a particular class of persons hostile to them. The Licensing Bill, as it came up to your Lordships' House, gave a certain amount of compensation to licence holders. That Bill was rejected. What do the Government now propose to do? They propose to tax the property of these licence holders and give them no compensation whatever.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0449"/>
<col>885</col>
Therefore, I say it is absolutely unconstitutional to tack on to the Budget Bill another Bill which has been rejected by your Lordships, whose action was endorsed by the country. So far as I can see, the Government deal more harshly with these people in the Budget than they did in their original Licensing Bill. That Bill we rejected in this House. We may have rejected rightly or wrongly; but I believe that we rejected it absolutely rightly, and if your Lordships choose to look at the opinions given by the country whenever the opportunity has been presented, I think you will not deny that we had the weight of the country at our back in the course we took. I know that it is said, "The Trade," as they are called, must pay their share. I do not hesitate to say there is no member of your Lordships' House, or of any trade, who is not perfectly willing and anxious to pay his fair share of the taxes imposed upon him, according to his ability; but to ask people to pay as their share a tax put upon them, as I say vindictively, is not, to my mind, an act of which any Government should feel proud.<lb/>
To go back to what I was saying about the trade paying their share, I think the licensing trade do pay their share to a very great extent, an enormous extent. I will not give your Lordships my own views on the subject. Naturally I have not experience on the subject; but I should like to bring under your Lordships' notice what the trade do pay so as to show that they are bearing their fair share of the taxation. The trade, as a matter of fact, already bear a very heavy share of the taxation of the country. The State now takes from the trade thirty-seven and a-half million pounds in the shape of taxation. And yet the Government talk about the necessity of making it pay a fair share &#x0021; I would like to remind your Lordships, too, that extra taxes were put on the trade in 1900. They were then told distinctly that they were war taxes, but Mr. Asquith has made them permanent. They have also to bear the annual charge of over &#x00A3;1,000,000 for the Compensation Fund under the Act of 1904. Therefore, I say from the standpoint of justice, it is impossible to defend these taxes. Is it easier to defend them from a financial point of view? The reason members of this trade are so heavily taxed is, to my mind, because they are obnoxious to the
<col>886</col>
Party opposite and because they ventured to object to their property being attacked. Consequently they are supporters of the Party behind me. I venture to say the taxes proposed in the Budget on land and licensing are unjust and very vindictive, and consequently I support the proposal of my noble friend behind me that this matter should be entrusted to the verdict of the country. I maintain that the Land Taxes are merely proposed for the purpose of bringing about the nationalisation of the land, while the Licensing Taxes are vindictive and unjust to a body who are supposed to be opposed to the Government.<lb/>
I now cut myself adrift from the taxes, which I have said are unjust and vindictive, and I turn to another side of the question introduced into the Budget Bill. That is the taxation of minerals. I speak with a certain amount of diffidence and at the same time confidence, on this subject because I am myself very closely associated with the coal trade of the North of England. I hope your Lordships will forgive me if, on that account, I deal with this question at greater length than I ordinarily should. The Budget Bill, as at first introduced, proposed to put a tax on Ungotten Minerals. I can only tell your Lordships that when that proposal was recognised and realised by people who either owned or did not own "ungotten minerals," it could hardly be believed that such a proposal could emanate from any one who had any knowledge of any sort or kind whatever in connection with minerals. Look what might have happened &#x0021; An agricultural landowner might be told that there were minerals under his land. That unfortunate landowner would be only too pleased to have his minerals worked, but he has not the capital to work them and no company would possibly work them. And yet that unfortunate man was to be taxed for those ungotten minerals because it was supposed&#x2014;only supposed&#x2014;that there were minerals underlying his land. When you think that over, your Lordships must realise that it was a proposal too ridiculous to be considered by any practical man.<lb/>
It was ridiculed out of court, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer naturally seeing how ridiculous were his proposals cast about to see what he could do to obtain from another source the revenue he had hoped to get from minerals. He
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0450"/>
<col>887</col>
then turned round and taxed royalties and wayleaves, exactly the contrary to what he had proposed in his original Bill. First, he proposed to tax owners who had "ungotten minerals" in the hope of making the unfortunate people pay who could not work them themselves or get any one else to work those minerals, and he now taxes the royalty owners and leaves untaxed those mineral owners who do not or cannot or will not work their own minerals. There never was such a change of front, I should think, in the annals of any Chancellor of the Exchequer &#x0021; Even that staunch supporter of the Government, Mr. Hemmerde, said in the House of Commons, "He was unable to understand how a tax on mining royalties could take the place of a tax on ' ungotten minerals ' consistently with the principles of the Bill. One of the great principles that ran all through the Bill was that whether a man was working his land or not, he should pay a tax upon its value. What the Government now proposed to do was to tax those who were working their mining land even more than they were originally going to tax those who were not working it. That was a startling theory." I should like to hear from the noble Lord who will answer me how he reconciles this extraordinary change of front, and how he reconciles the statement of Mr. Hemmerde with the proposals in the Budget Bill at the present moment.<lb/>
Then again, supporters of noble. Lords opposite declare that royalty owners pay next to nothing; that they derive an enormous amount of benefit from the minerals worked underneath their land to which they have contributed nothing. Here I will quote the words of Mr. John Wilson. I am bound to say he is a Liberal Unionist, but he is a very great and important authority on all matters connected with the working of coal in Scotland. In reply to the query, "What does the royalty owner do?" he says, "He pays Income Tax just as any other form of income does, and in Scotland the exact amount of all royalties received by the proprietor is entered on the valuation roll, and local rates, poor, education and sanitary, &amp;c, are paid on every farthing thereof by him to the extent of one half of the burden, the mineral lessee only paying the other half." I think that that entirely disposes of the statement that the royalty owner pays nothing towards the taxes of the country owing to the minerals being worked under his own land.<lb/>
<col>888</col>
Now I go a step further, and I will deal for a few moments with the result which will accrue from the tax that is put upon mining royalties. There can be no doubt whatever that this tax on royalties must raise the price of coal, and if your Lordships carefully consider the matter you must realise that almost all our great industries are dependent to a very great extent on coal. If the price of coal is increased the cost of production in all those industries to which I have alluded must necessarily be increased. Not only that, but it places all those industries which are dependent on coal upon unfair terms as regards the competition of foreign countries. What a higher price of coal means to the poor people of this country I am sure will appeal to your Lordships' sympathy. You must see that if the cost of production of coal is increased the price of coal must increase, and naturally it will reflect on the poorer classes. There are a great number of important industries that depend on coal. One of the most important in this country is the steel trade. That trade will be especially affected if the, price of coal is raised, owing to the increased cost of production. The steel trade will have to bear an additional burden in respect of paying a higher price for the coal they have to buy, and in addition to that they will have to suffer the disability of having to pay an increased price for ore. Ore is absolutely essential to the steel industry, and consequently if you increase the cost of production of that most important branch of industry in this country it must naturally raise its price. I should like again to quote an authority better than myself&#x2014;I quote authorities always if I can do so, preferably of gentlemen opposed to me in politics. I find that Mr. Wedgwood, who is a member of Parliament and a supporter of noble Lords opposite and an enthusiastic Land Tax reformer, made a speech in which he dealt with the proposal to substitute a tax on mining royalties for the duty on ungotten minerals. He said:&#x2014;
<quote>"The proposed change is that the tax shall be levied only on minerals which are worked, thereby penalising production, and in the long run transferring the tax to the consumer. Directly you arrange your tax so that the price of coal will be enhanced, you will be inflicting a most serious blow on the industries of this country."</quote>
That, to my mind, is a most serious state of affairs, and I really think the Government should look into it before they ask your Lordships to pass the Bill.<lb/>
Now I go on to another point as to what
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0451"/>
<col>889</col>
is the amount of revenue to be derived from this tax on these royalties, and I am sure the noble Earl who leads your Lordships' House will forgive me when I say there seems to me the most absolute confusion in the minds of the Government, their advisers and everybody else as to what this tax on royalties will bring in. I should like to have a definite answer from whoever replies to me as to what the Government imagine will be the amount of revenue brought in by these royalties. It is a very important question because so far as I can gather, at the present moment the Government seem to be in a state of utter confusion as to what that revenue is to be. I do hope I shall get an answer on this point. Mr. Lloyd-George, speaking at Limehouse, said the landlords received &#x00A3;8,000,000 a year from royalties. The September number of the <i>Liberal Monthly</i>, the organ of the Liberal Federation, informed a correspondent that the latest available figures as to the royalties and wayleaves in the United Kingdom are those given in the Mining Royalties Commission Report of 1903. Those figures show a total of &#x00A3;4,873,000 from royalties and wayleaves on coal, ironstone, iron ore and other metals. That is one statement. I then turn to the official handbook to the Budget issued by the Budget League. On every ton of iron ore the royalty is said to be 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and on every ton of coal 9<i>d</i>. Since 268,000,000 tons of coal and about 10,000,000 tons of iron were obtained from British mines in 1907 the royalties in that year on those two minerals alone must have totalled &#x00A3;11,300,000. Finally, we may note that Mr. Asquith, the Prime Minister, estimated to get &#x00A3;325,000 from a five per cent. tax on royalties which points to about &#x00A3;6,500,000 of royalties. What I want to ask is, which of those estimates is correct? The official return says &#x00A3;4,873,000; Mr. Asquith says &#x00A3;6,500,000; Mr. Lloyd-George says &#x00A3;8,000,000; and the Budget League says &#x00A3;11,300,000. I will give those figures to the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, and I will ask him to answer me because I think we ought to have something definite as to the amount that will be derived from the proposed taxes on royalties.<lb/>
Now I turn to another point, that of capital leaving this country. My noble friend Lord Revelstoke, whom I congratulate on the masterly speech he made last night, dealt with the question of capital flying from this country so that I hardly need do more than touch upon it. But I do not think that those who have submitted
<col>890</col>
this Budget to your Lordships' House are realising the great danger they are risking by forcing and driving capital out of this country. I do not think they realise how the industry of this country depends entirely on the flow of capital being spent in this country. I know that the supporters of His Majesty's Government declare that if only wealth is taxed it is wealth, and wealth only, which will pay. I have other views on this subject, and Mr. Harold Cox holds the same views as I do. Mr. Harold Cox says:&#x2014;
<quote>"Many people seem to imagine that if a tax is paid only by the rich it is the rich alone who feel it. That is not so. So far as the question of employment is concerned, the effect of a tax is the same, whether it is paid by rich or poor. If a rich man has to pay an extra &#x00A3;50 a year for income tax, he has &#x00A3;50 less to spend on the multifarious industries that minister directly or indirectly to his comfort. The, people he was employing are thrown out of work."</quote>
That was stated by Mr. Harold Cox in a pamphlet issued by the Liberal Publication Department in 1905. I do not wish to eulogise capitalists. I suppose I shall be told I am a capitalist myself. I hope I and those who have gone before me have so spent our capital as to have produced an enormous amount of work and labour for the working-classes in the districts in which we have lived. But I am not singular in this. I suppose a vast number of your Lordships and your predecessors have done exactly the same. But let me point out to your Lordships that if capital is reduced there must be less work, there must be less wages, and there must be more unemployment.<lb/>
What is the position in regard to unemployment at the present moment? I live in the North of England, near the Tyne, the Tees and the Wear, and unemployment is rife in all those districts. Are you justified in driving capital out of the country? It might mean giving employment to those people. As capital goes out of the country the ranks of the unemployed must be swelled weekly and almost hourly. I know that in the North of England, in the district in which I live, there are hundreds of men anxious to get employment. But how can they get employment if capital is not expended? How are the factories to be maintained? How is the machinery to be maintained? How are even the tools to be maintained to give work to those men if capital is flying out of the country? Let me remind your Lordships that the State has never been, and is not, responsible for the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0452"/>
<col>891</col>
great centres which at the present moment give employment to so many people. Look at your coal mines, iron works, telegraphs, telephones, and any other industries you may choose to select. Have they been developed by the State? Not at all. They have been developed by private enterprise, by the outlay of capital, and if once that capital begins to fly, and continues to fly, naturally all those great industries must languish. Why? Because there is no money to be invested in them and to give employment to those who naturally depend upon them. I read the other day a speech by Mr. Hobhouse, with whom no one will accuse me of being a sympathiser; he is a colleague of noble Lords opposite. What did Mr. Hobhouse say? He said:&#x2014;
<quote>"There were some people, equally unwise, who thought you could put capital on one side and labour on the other. In his judgment, there was the closest possible relation between capital and labour, and each lived by the other; and if we were to do anything which would drive capital, permanently or temporarily, from this country, we should undoubtedly inflict a lasting blow on all who laboured by hand or brain."</quote>
Therefore are you justified, either by your previous policy or by your policy as shown in the Budget at the present moment, in driving capital out of this country?<lb/>
I should like to hear from noble Lords who will follow me whether they deny the statement that capital is flying from this country. I know full well that the Prime Minister stated that he did not seem to mind if capital were flying from this country. I thought it an extraordinary remark for a man in his position to make. Then I read also a speech by Mr. Winston Churchill in which he denied that capital was flying from this country. The ways of the present Cabinet are somewhat difficult to understand. Who represents the Cabinet at the present moment? Whether it is Mr. Asquith or Mr. Churchill seems to us outsiders a difficult point to decide. At any rate, I think it is a little difficult to reconcile the two statements of those very eminent members of His Majesty's Government. But that capital is flying out of the country I do not think anybody will deny. I had brought under my notice the other day a statement by no less an authority than the Chairman of Parr's Bank who, on January 28, of this year, said&#x2014;
<quote>"A feature of the year had been the small proportion of British capital which had been invested in home industries. Out of a total of &#x00A3;203,000,000 no less than &#x00A3;148,000,000 had gone abroad into foreign or Colonial investments."</quote>
<col>892</col>
In view of that statement, from a man in that position, surely we are justified in saying that if capital is leaving the country at this extraordinary rate, it is not altogether to be wondered at that the condition of unemployment is what it is at the present moment.<lb/>
Therefore I say that this Budget should be referred to the people of this country to let them really recognise for themselves what the policy of the present Government is and to say whether it is to be continued in the future as it has been in the past. There is only one word I need to say as to the reasons why I support the Amendment of the noble Marquess referring this matter to the country. One reason is that I think these proposals are based on Socialistic grounds. I know full well that I shall be told by noble Lords opposite and by their colleagues in another place that they repudiate Socialism entirely. I need only say that much as I respect them I prefer to take the word of the leading Socialist, Mr. Snowden. He informed us in a speech that a number of the measures that are introduced into this Budget were proposed by him to Mr. Lloyd-George. I do not think any noble Lord will contradict me when I say that Mr. Snowden has been really more or less responsible for this Socialistic Budget. I feel I shall be endorsed by Mr. Snowden's own words. These are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"The Chancellor of the Exchequer last year said that the suggestions I had put forward might be useful for some future Chancellor of the Exchequer. I want to congratulate him upon being a great and apt pupil, and for not having waited to allow a future Chancellor of the Exchequer to begin to put those suggestions into practice."</quote>
If after that I call the Budget a Socialistic Budget I am endorsed by Mr. Snowden's own words.<lb/>
Again I say I cordially, and to the best of my ability, endorse the Amendment of the noble Marquess. I object to this Budget because I consider it is unconstitutional, it is unjust, and it is vindictive. On those grounds I think the noble Marquess, in the interests constitutionally of your Lordships' House, was bound to move the Amendment he has submitted. But I think he has done more and wisely done more. He has taken this Budget out of the hands of your Lordships. It cannot be said that your Lordships have rejected this measure. I know there are a great many of your Lordships who would have liked to have seen it rejected. Whether they are right or wrong, I offer no opinion;
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0453"/>
<col>893</col>
but the noble Marquess has taken the line of appealing to the country. He would appeal to the people, in whom he has confidence. The position of your Lordships' House has always been a great one in the minds of the people of this country because you have never refused to accept any measure when the people had an opportunity of speaking and have spoken in its favour. Now the people will decide whether this Budget: should become the law of the land or whether it should not. I cordially endorse the Amendment of the noble Marquess, firmly believing that whatever the decision of the people is your Lordships will most loyally and heartily abide by it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03428"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am one of those who would have preferred to amend the Finance Bill, retaining the existing taxes and some of those now pro-posed; but after the repeated declarations made by the Government that they would admit no amendment, however reasonable, I can well understand that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition thinks that this would be a waste of time. I hold in my hand quotations from Mr. Gladstone in which he took the view that your Lordships had exactly the same power of amendment as you have of rejection, but in existing circumstances I will not trouble you with those quotations in view of the repeated declarations of the Government to which I have referred. The extreme violence of the speeches in which your Lordships have been attacked for months past has fallen very flat. They will not hurt your Lordships, and I think the country will draw the obvious conclusion that it is impossible to find arguments in defence of the Budget. Moreover, we have not only just right to protest against speeches of extreme violence, tending to set class against class, but also against statements either very much exaggerated, or in some cases altogether without foundation. Even my noble friend Lord Welby, who is generally so cautious, has actually told the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> that in adopting Lord Lansdowne's Amendment "the Lords in one day will add between &#x00A3;40,000,000 and &#x00A3;50,000,000 to the national liabilities." But in his interesting speech last night my noble friend did not adhere to this statement. I do not think that he will contradict me when I say that the Resolution will not add a penny to the national liabilities. What my noble friend, I think,
<col>894</col>
meant to say was that it would affect that amount of taxation. But he knows very well that, even that is only technically correct, and if there should be any chaos in the finances of the country it could only be by the action of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
But first of all, my Lords, I should like to point out that&#x2014;as it seems to me at least&#x2014;the Bill does not come to us with any moral force. Ever since its introduction elections have been going against the Government. Moreover, look at the majorities by which the several clauses of the Finance Bill have been carried in the House of Commons. The system under which the House of Commons is elected is by no means satisfactory. Twice in recent elections a minority in the country has secured a majority in the House of Commons. At the last General Election, on the contrary, it so happened that the majority in the country obtained a far larger proportional majority in the House. In 1906, according to the poll-book issued by the Liberal Publication Department, the Radicals polled 3,044,000 votes and secured 428 representatives, while the Unionists polled 2,400,000 and only obtained 139 representatives. "If," says the Report, "the Government only held as many seats as this vote majority entitled it to proportionately, this seat majority would be ninety-four. As a fact it is 354." That is to say the Government have 260 more votes in the House of Commons than they are entitled to by the votes given in the country. But their majorities in the Divisions on the Budget clauses have never reached to anything like this figure. They have ranged up to 180 and fallen below forty. If, then, the Government had only a majority in the House of Commons corresponding to their majority in the country, they would have been unable to pass the Bill. So far as arithmetic goes, we are entitled to say that the country is against the Bill.<lb/>
The Bill is so far-reaching that it is impossible to deal with all the problems raised, and I will not refer to the additional taxes on alcohol and tobacco, except to guard myself against being supposed to approve them, though some increase may be desirable. Nor will I follow Lord Lansdowne into his remarks about Tariff Reform except to say that while any general imposition of duties
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0454"/>
<col>895</col>
would lead to the evils pointed out in the excellent Report of the Committee on Direct and Indirect Taxation of 1840; additional Customs Duties will clearly bring in more if they are supplemented by Excise Duties and in that case, would involve no abandonment of Free Trade.<lb/>
I now come to the proportion between direct and indirect taxation. The Prime Minister in his speech at Sheffield in May took the produce of the new indirect taxes at &#x00A3;6,100,000 and of direct taxes at &#x00A3;6,850,000. This he considered was a fair proportion. But it will be observed that this figure is only that for the present year, and as Lord George Hamilton has shown, the real amount from direct taxes will be over &#x00A3;25,000,000, which by the showing of the Prime Minister himself is most unfair. Sir Robert Giffen, who certainly will be admitted to be one of the highest authorities, in a recent article on the Budget has expressed the same opinion. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The indirect taxes are obviously too low in proportion to the Income Tax and Death Duties."</quote>
Moreover, the fact that they are too heavy is not, as Sir Robert has also pointed out, the only objection to the Income Tax and Death Duties. In the first place the Income Tax is in many cases a tax not really on income, but on capital. This is the case as regards all incomes from wasting securities. So far as the present tax is concerned, of course the Government are not responsible. The injustice has always been admitted, and so far no remedy has been found. It has always been admitted to be a strong reason for keeping the tax low; but the Government are now raising it heavily without making the slightest effort to remove the injustice. The second reason for keeping the tax low is that it is a reserve in times of difficulty and in case of war, but the Government now are raising it in a time of peace almost as high as, and indeed in some cases higher than, it has ever before been in a time of war.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I am not going into the question of the land taxes, because that has been dealt with by speakers more able to speak with authority on the subject than I am; but I should like to say a few words on the question of graduation. I fear that I shall not carry all of your Lordships, even on this side of the House, with me in objecting to the principle of graduation. No doubt Government are not open
<col>896</col>
to the charge of introducing the system. They are, however, seriously aggravating the injustice commenced by their predecessors. But that is precisely the danger of graduation. It has always been objected to by the highest authorities because if you once begin there is no logical reason why you should stop. This is the second graduation of Income Tax, and the third of the Death Duties. Moreover, several members of the Government have warned us that if they have their will, others are in store. John Stuart Mill, himself a strong Radical, lays it down as an axiom that&#x2014;
<quote>"to tax the larger income at a higher percentage than the smaller is to levy a tax on industry and economy, to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbours. It is a partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery &#x2026; A just and wise administration would abstain from holding out motives for dissipating rather than saving the earnings of honest exertion."</quote>
Another high authority, Mr. Lecky, in his work on Democracy, says that&#x2014;
<quote>"it is obvious that a graduated tax is a direct penalty imposed on saving and industry, a direct premium offered to idleness and extravagance. It discourages the very habits and qualities which it is most in the interest of the Stale to foster &#x2026; It is at the same time perfectly arbitrary &#x2026; . Highly graduated taxation realises most completely the supreme danger of democracy, creating a state of things in which one class imposes on another burdens which it is not asked to share, and compels the State into vast schemes of extravagance, under the belief that the whole cost will be thrown upon others &#x2026; . Yet no truth of political economy is more certain than that a heavy taxation of capital will fall most severely on the poor."</quote>
I should like again to quote Sir Robert Giffen, who, in a recent article in the <i>Quarterly</i>, lays it down that&#x2014;
<quote>"all graduation is an interference with individual right which it is one of the main functions of the State to support."</quote>
Every step taken in this direction makes it more difficult to resist the next. If you agree to the proposals in this Budget you will have no logical basis for objecting to a further step in the same direction. Graduation not only takes an unfair part of a man's property, but lowers the value of the rest, because it strikes a blow at all security of possession. It necessarily creates a want of confidence and a feeling of insecurity. The idea is that you are going to remedy an injustice. How is that done? At present the figures are &#x00A3;5,000 and 6<i>d</i>. Why are these figures taken? Perhaps the Government will explain. I can only suggest that as there are said to be only from 10,000 to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0455"/>
<col>897</col>
12,000 persons with over &#x00A3;5,000 a year&#x2014;a number which seems to me to be below the mark&#x2014;the Government consider that it is safe to tax&#x2014;might I not have said "rob"?&#x2014;them. I do not think the Government will find it possible to give any logical reason for the figures they have chosen. But no doubt they will tell us that I graduation places the burden on the shoulders best able to bear it. How do they know that? They assume that a man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year is richer than one with &#x00A3;4,000 a year. But this is to fall into the fundamental error of looking at one side only of the account. They take the incoming and ignore the outgoing. They look only at the assets and ignore the liabilities. A bachelor with &#x00A3;4,000 a year is better off&#x2014;I mean, of course, only financially&#x2014;than a man, with a wife and family, who has &#x00A3;5,000. And yet the man who is really the richer of the two will pay Jess Income Tax. The man with &#x00A3;4,000 a year may support the Government proposals now, and deem himself fortunate in escaping the Super Tax which the man with &#x00A3;5,000 has to pay. But how long will he escape? His turn will inevitably come; then that of the man with &#x00A3;3,000, and so on.<lb/>
Then I come to the Death Duties, and I will take the case of three men each inherit-lug &#x00A3;20,000. One is an only son whose father left &#x00A3;20,000, and he will have paid &#x00A3;1,000. The second is one of five children whose father leaves &#x00A3;100,000; they also will each receive &#x00A3;20,000, but they will each have paid &#x00A3;1,600. The third is one of ten children whose father leaves &#x00A3;200,000; they also will each get &#x00A3;20,000 but they will each have paid &#x00A3;2,000&#x0021; I should have said, what can be more absurd and ridiculous, if it were not so serious. But what can be more unfair and unjust? If you are to graduate at all it should obviously be on the sum a man inherits, not on the size of the estate from which it is derived. Graduation, therefore, not only leads logically to Socialism, but creates many cases of hardship and injustice&#x2014;as many as, and perhaps even more than, it redresses.<lb/>
The Government, I believe, consider that the Budget will, first, provide for the immense addition to our expenditure for which they are responsible with as little disturbance as possible to business&#x2014;to our manufacturing and commercial interests; secondly, that it will promote building, and tend to improve
<col>898</col>
the dwellings of the poor; and, thirdly, that it will throw the burden of taxation on the rich and spare the poor. These are excellent intentions; if I thought they would be fulfilled I would unquestionably vote for the Bill. But before sitting down I will endeavour to show that, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the provisions of the Bill will have the very opposite effect.<lb/>
We are told that the House of Lords has never before thrown out a Finance Bill, But the House has never before had such a Bill to consider. The bankers and merchants of London have never before denounced a Budget. We are divided in political opinions and have never before as a body taken such a step. But they felt so strongly that the present Budget would be disastrous to our commerce that they drew up a remonstrance to the Government in which among other arguments against the Budget they say&#x2014;
<quote>"The great increase and graduation of the Death Duties&#x2014;already materially raised but two years ago&#x2014;and of the income tax coupled with the super tax, will, we are confident, prove seriously injurious to the commerce and industries of the country."</quote>
That was signed by representatives of every bank in London and almost all the great-mercantile houses. It was no political demonstration; it was signed by the late Liberal candidate for the City and the Chairman of the City Liberal Association. Not content with that, a great meeting in the City was called. They invited no great Statesman. It was purely a business and City meeting. But the great hall at Cannon-street was crowded. Lord Rothschild presided, and was supported by the leading bankers, merchants, and others intimately associated with the trade and commerce of London. Almost every important City house and institution was represented. Representatives of every great bank and insurance office were present, and the following resolution was unanimously passed&#x2014;
<quote>"That this meeting, while recognising the necessity for increased taxation, is of opinion that the cumulative effect of the proposed heavy charges on both capital and income will be to discourage enterprise and thrift, and will prove seriously injurious to the commerce and industries of the country."</quote>
No doubt a subsequent meeting was held to support the Budget, but with one or two exceptions, easy to account for, those responsible for the trade and commerce of the country were conspicuous by their absence.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0456"/>
<col>899</col>
I believe, for instance, that not a single chairman of a bank, of an insurance company, or, indeed, of any great commercial institution attended to support the Prime Minister.<lb/>
We maintain that the policy of the Governmen has lowered the value of every one's property. While the securities of almost every foreign Government have risen Consols have fallen, so that every new loan&#x2014;those for Irish Land purchase, for instance&#x2014;will have to be raised on more onerous terms. Municipal securities have fallen, partly, no doubt, on account of increased expenditure, but partly from want of confidence. Members of the Stock Exchange may not be great authorities on political economy, but they are petty good judges as to prices, and they are certainly of opinion that the policy of the Government has lowered prices and that they would rise if the Government went out. It cannot be denied that the Budget has created a general feeling of unrest and insecurity, and this cannot be good for the country. There is, moreover, a general consensus of opinion that capital is leaving the country. The Government have evidently not considered what this means. The Prime Minister has made two contradictory statements in one speech. First he ridiculed the idea, and asked with an air of triumph, Where is it going to? He, however, gave the answer himself a few sentences later. "It is a fact," he said, "that we have sent millions of British capital into the uttermost corners of the earth." I will ask the House to consider the effect of this in a few moments. But I must point out that it is not a question of British capital only. Hitherto, much foreign capital has been invested here to the great advantage of the country. The Budget is putting an end to that satisfactory state of things. The noble Earl, Lord Crewe, may say that the commercial community do not understand their own business, but he cannot deny that an overwhelming majority of those concerned believe that the Budget will deal a heavy blow to the trade and commerce of the country.<lb/>
I come now to the second object, a very excellent object, which the Government have in view&#x2014;to encourage building and thus improve the dwellings of the working classes. Here, again, I submit that expert opinion is almost unanimous against the land proposals in the Budget. The Law Society appointed
<col>900</col>
a committee to examine and report upon the Bill. The Committee have made a valuable report criticising the Bill severely. They say that&#x2014;
<quote>"They regard them [<i>i.e.</i>, the land clauses] as unjust in principle, in that they are specially directed against owners or a particular class of property, and one which already bears its fair share of Imperial and local burdens, as unnecessary from a purely financial point of view, as seeking to bring about under the pretext of taxation results which, if deemed desirable, should be openly pursued by substantive legislation, and as calculated to cause dislocation of business and to augment unemployment."</quote>
And again&#x2014;
<quote>"A change of such importance ought not to be brought forward as part of a financial measure. If for purposes of public policy the owners of land are to be deprived of part of their property, it should be upon terms of payment of a reasonable price, and not by taking the property without compensation and calling the process taxation."</quote>
The Law Society of Ireland have expressed very similar opinions, and they add that I some of the proposals "will weigh with special severity on the tenant farmers of Ireland." The Land Agents' Society have issued a Memorandum in which they point out that the "so-called unearned increment" does not, and is never likely to, exist, except in the shape of accumulated interest on locked up capital; that "the Ministerial estimate of &#x00A3;2,000,000 as the cost of the valuation of the land &#x2026; is wholly inadequate." They believe&#x2014;
<quote>"that the view is held in some quarters that the increased burdens imposed upon the land by the Bill will affect large landowners only. Nothing, in their opinion, could be further from the truth. On the contrary, in many respects&#x2014;such as, for instance, valuation&#x2014;the cost to a small owner must necessarily be relatively very much greater than to a large owner. In the opinion of the Committee no landlord, however small, will be able in prudence to dispense with the services of a skilled valuer."</quote>
The Society of Auctioneers, which was founded more than a hundred years ago, express the opinion that&#x2014;
<quote>"The cost both to the nation and private owners will be enormous, and altogether out of proportion to the revenue obtained. The valuations will be very complicated, and in many cases there will be conflicting interests in connection with the same property. The effect of the Bill will be to create distrust and uncertainty with regard to the tenure of land, and will lead capitalists and others to abandon land as a subject for investment."</quote>
The Surveyors' Association have issued a statement, in which they point out that&#x2014;
<quote>"At the present time, owing to the great decrease in the value of property, the margin on
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0457"/>
<col>901</col>
many mortgages lifts boon reduced below the statutory one-third, and the imposition of the proposed duties will cause a still further reduction, so that trustees and others who have hitherto regarded mortgages as one of the soundest forms of investment will he compelled to call in their capital and invest it in other securities; the result being great hardship on, and expense to, the owners of property, and restriction of the capital available for investment of land."</quote>
The Valuers' Association sent out a circular to all their members, and received 421 replies. Of these 411 condemn the land clauses and only ten support them. They say that the Finance Bill has already had a deterrent effect on the letting of building land, and some of the signatories have experienced instances where contracts which were on the eve of completion have been annulled on account of the cumulative taxes proposed, and the cancelling of these agreements will cause an enormous amount of unemployment in the building and allied trades.<lb/>
I have the honour to be, and to have been for twenty-five years, president of the Building Societies Association. The societies of which it is composed have over &#x00A3;70,000,000 sterling invested in such securities, and they will also be very adversely affected. For instance, the secretaries and surveyors of the Bradford Equitable, in their Report to the Society, point out that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Budget suggestions for Land taxation are so complicated and apparently unworkable that there appears to be no possibility of making any useful suggestion for their amendment, and the probability of further legislation on similar lines, increasing the amount of the taxes, will for a considerable time seriously unsettle the property market and reduce the selling value of all real estate far beyond the amount of the proposed taxes. This state will certainly continue until buyers can estimate with a fair amount of accuracy the full effect of such legislation."</quote>
The Government proposals were put forward with the view of encouraging the building trade. But what has been the result? The London builders have issued a manifesto in which after saying that they have had a long experience and employ many thousands of workmen, they add that their business has been paralysed by the Budget&#x2014;
<quote>"Since the Budget proposals have been placed before the public no one of us has taken up any land for building purposes. The reason for this is that while we, as traders, are as desirous as ever we were to do business, we are unable to entertain proposals which would result in nothing but a serious loss. The increment duty of twenty per cent. and the 100 per cent. increase in Stamp Duties are, perhaps, the direct causes of the paralysis of our industries and the demoralisation
<col>902</col>
of those who have been accustomed to invest their money in building. Beyond this, the little man who builds a house, frequently paying for it in instalments, will no longer dream of investing his savings or committing himself financially by dealing in house property, The actual result is that with an immediately diminishing number of workers we are merely completing existing contracts; and seeing that not one of us has bought a single estate since the Budget was introduced, the outlook for the winter months, so far as the worker is concerned, is grave beyond any possibility of exaggeration. We are anxious to continue business; we are wishful of finding further work for our men, some of whom have been with us many years; but this is impossible; and we give this warning of the general collapse in the building trade in the hope that something may yet be done to avert what cannot but prove to be a terrible industrial calamity."</quote>
There is, in fact, a most remarkable consensus of opinion amongst those best qualified to judge, that the effects of the proposals will be disastrous. Those who have issued these protests against the land clauses are not millionaires or large landowners, but hard-headed men of business speaking of what is within their own knowledge.<lb/>
I now come to the last point. The Government maintain that the Bill will benefit the poor at the expense of the rich. When members of the Government at public meetings can spare a few moments from the abuse of their opponents to the defence of their Bill, they generally sum up their remarks by declaring, without showing how, that it is a "poor man's Budget." My Lords, it is nothing of the kind. The Chancellor of the Exchequer seems to think that to diminish wealth is to diminish poverty. It would be truer to say that if you diminish wealth, you increase poverty. The Government may, and will, ruin many of those who now consider themselves well off, but it is not in the power of any Government permanently to alter the incidence of taxation. The effect is being constantly modified by change in wages, in hours of work, by special allowances, and in other ways. But though it is not in the power of Government to affect permanently the incidence of taxation, it is in their power to affect for good or evil the prosperity of the country. It can hardly be denied that, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the effect of the Budget on trade and commerce of the country will be disastrous. So far from encouraging building, the Budget, in the opinion of builders, is doing and will do the very reverse. It has paralysed their business and would throw thousands out of employment.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0458"/>
<col>903</col>
So far as land is concerned, I have shown that in the opinion, not of great landowners, but in that of those practically concerned in land management, the Bill will be disastrous. Moreover, it is entirely an error to suppose that it will affect large landowners only. On the contrary, the cost to small owners will be proportionally more heavy, and the general effect more injurious. Building, again, has been seriously checked. So far as London is concerned, little land has lately been taken up for building; if the Bill passes, we shall have to face a general collapse of the business and thousands will be thrown out of employment. That, again, is not merely my own opinion, which would be of little importance, but is that of the highest authorities in the City. They said in their weighty remonstrance&#x2014;
<quote>"In conclusion, we would point out that, though the taxes to which we have taken exception will, in the first instance, fall with excessive severity on capital, they will also in our opinion tend to discourage private enterprise and thrift, thus in the long run diminishing employment and reducing wages."</quote>
Of course, they may be quite mistaken, but that is their opinion. Again, the Budget is a discouragement to thrift and industry. As men advance in life they naturally begin to consider when they should retire from work, whether what they expect to make will repay the effort. But if Government are going to take a shilling and eightpence per cent. for income tax, naturally men will retire earlier. The whole nation will be the poorer, and in this way again the employment of artisans will be diminshed.<lb/>
The attempt to delude the working classes into the idea that these taxes fall exclusively on the rich will have another unfortunate effect. It will tend to promote extravagance and discourage economy. We have seen the malign influence of the compound householder on municipal expenditure, and are paying heavier rates because so many electors are under the impression that they have no interest in economy. In the same way, if Parliamentary electors are persuaded that it is in the power of Government to throw taxation on the rich, it will become even more difficult to resist excessive national expenditure. I do not for a moment question the desire of the Government to benefit the poor, but am persuaded that they are going the wrong way to work. Real charity is that which makes the recipients more independent; unwise charity makes them more dependent.<lb/>
<col>904</col>
The tendency of legislation under the present Government is to make our poor more dependent&#x2014;less independent.<lb/>
Lastly, more capital in the country means more employment. If capital comes into the country it is spent in paying for labour, and wages tend to rise; when capital leaves the country there is less demand for labour, and wages fall. My Lords, when we find that the effect of this Bill, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, must necessarily be to drive capital out of the country, to create a feeling of insecurity and want of confidence, to lower the value of property, check industry and discourage thrift, diminish employment and lower wages, we cannot surely, in the interests of the whole community, take the responsibility of passing the Bill as it stands. Since the Government tell us that under no circumstances will they accept any amendment, we are not only entitled, but bound, to submit these facts and arguments for the consideration of our countrymen, and to secure for them the opportunity of deciding for themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03429"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: With the permission of your Lordships I should like, as my first duty, to express regret at the absence of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and for the cause of it. The noble Marquess's gallant effort yesterday afternoon to overcome the obvious physical discomfort from which he was suffering, was as much admired on the Government side of the House as on the other. Even in the midst of this controversy we may all join in the hope that he will not be long incapacitated from joining in debates in the House. My second duty is to answer some observations which were addressed to me earlier in the evening by Lord Londonderry, one of which I will answer at once by handing to him the financial statement which has been issued as a White Paper by another place, which is numbered 116, and which contains the information he asked for in the paper which he handed to me across the Table.<lb/>
Now it seems to me that there is on this subject&#x2014;it is common to both sides of the House&#x2014;a vast quantity of theory. There is also a vast quantity of fact as to which there can be no dispute, and I hope your Lordships will forgive me if I try to confine myself first to that part of the subject which deals with hard dry facts rather than with large constitutional theories. An admission was made, I think, by the noble Marquess
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0459"/>
<col>905</col>
the Leader of the Oppostion, and it was re-echoed by other speakers on that side of the House, that the Amendment we are now discussing is without; precedent. But it was also contended that the provisions of the Budget are also without precedent; that they are revolutionary and Socialistic. That being the noble Lord's contention, I hope I may be allowed to go into the matter in some detail and to ask your Lordships where there is anything revolutionary or where the Government have taken any improper step.<lb/>
We know there is a deficit, almost unexampled in time of peace, of &#x00A3;16,000,000. We know it is due in part to Old Age Pensions and in part to the increased requirements of the Navy. Noble Lords on both sides of the House have agreed to it, and I think there is no large body of opinion on either side of the House which is opposed to this increased expenditure. The Government propose to meet that deficit by reducing the Sinking Fund and by imposing various duties on stamps partly, and on motor cars, and increased duties on tobacco. Then we come to the more important duties. In the first place, there are the Death Duties, and in the course of this debate I have been sorry to see that no noble Lord opposite has made any reference to the fact that there has been some concession made in the direction of works of art, in the shape of a deduction proposed in the Finance Bill. I think, if I may say so, a very proper deduction in regard to works of art which are not the subject of a settlement has been made in this Budget, and that has not been acknowledged by noble Lords, who have found every objection they could to it.<lb/>
The Death Duties, though increased in amount, introduce no new principle, and cannot, therefore, be called revolutionary. Then when we come to the Income Tax and the Super Tax there are the allowances to the extent of twenty-five per cent. for the management of landed property. The noble Lord who has just sat down objected to the Super Tax and Graduated Income Tax. His arguments might properly have been addressed to noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite, for I do not understand that they have any serious objection to the one or the other. The noble Lord said that it was impossible for the tax collector to be sure that a man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year is better off than another man with &#x00A3;4,000 a year. That is quite true. I do not know that Mr. Rockefeller is any better off than I am
<col>906</col>
myself, but I have a shrewd suspicion that he is, and I have a shrewd suspicion that a man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year is better off than a man with &#x00A3;4,000.<lb/>
With regard to the Licence Duties, I do not intend now to follow the noble Lord on the Cross Benches who spoke just before dinner, but I desire to give a few figures in regard to these duties. These taxes are complained of, I think, by Lord Londonderry, who said that we had in the Finance Bill included the provisions of the Licensing Bill, and that these should have been in a separate measure. I am quite unable to understand arguments which are addressed to the House on those lines. The headings of the Licensing Bill included statutory deductions, local option as to prohibition, grant of licences, time limit, discretion of local licensing justices, schemes for statutory reduction, and reduction of amount of compensation, &amp;c. If there is anything from the Licensing Bill tacked on to the Finance Bill I would like to know the line and clause of the Finance Bill which contains it. The main principle which has actuated the Government in the revised scheme of licence duties is that the bigger houses should pay more than at present, and on a scale similar to that of the smaller houses. Under the scale proposed five per cent. of the public-houses will actually have their Licence Duty reduced, twenty-eight per cent. will have an increased duty of from 5<i>s</i>. to 10<i>s</i>. per annum, eight and a-half per cent. will have an increased duty of from &#x00A3;1 to &#x00A3;2 10<i>s</i>., while in the case of another six per cent. the amount of the average increase will range from &#x00A3;3 to &#x00A3;7. In the case of a further twenty-three and a-half per cent. the average increases range from &#x00A3;9 to &#x00A3;12 10<i>s</i>. a year; so that, in other words, no less than seven-tenths of the public-houses would have their Licence Duties reduced or they would have imposed upon them an average increase not exceeding &#x00A3;12 10<i>s</i>. a year. Setting aside some smaller licences which came between that figure and the next, thirteen per cent. would have their licences increased by an average sum of &#x00A3;45 per annum. These figures represent altogether eighty-four per cent. of the total number of the public-houses in the country. The heavily taxed houses are therefore relatively few, but these taxes are designed and meant to hit the immense new hotels which are a feature of modern life, which did not exist at the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0460"/>
<col>907</col>
time when Licence Duties were first introduced, and which, being new features in our modern life, have not been provided for in legislation in times gone by. Houses of that kind are obviously a very proper object of taxation on a higher scale, as compared with the taxation put upon smaller houses. In any case this extra taxation of big houses is after all no matter of new principle. Under those circumstances I think we are thrown back upon the last item in the Budget to find why it is that noble Lords opposite consider the Finance Bill revolutionary and Socialistic.<lb/>
Now we come to the Land Taxes. It is with very great surprise that I heard the Leader of the Opposition last night speak of these taxes as falling really upon an enterprise which fills relatively a much smaller place in the wealth of the country than it did forty or fifty years ago. The values which the Government propose to tax hardly existed forty or fifty years ago. This taxation of land values is not a taxation of agricultural land values, nor of the land throughout the country; it is the taxation of urban land values. Indeed, every Amendment which was suggested by the friends of noble Lords opposite designed to protect agriculture was, as far as possible, accepted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<lb/>
Clause 7, dealing with increment value, gives an exemption to agricultural land; Clause 14 (the reversion duty) and Clause 17 (undeveloped land duty) also exempt agricultural land. There is, therefore, here no question of the taxation of agricultural values. We are dealing with urban values, and what the Government propose to do is to ask that this vast wealth should contribute its fair share to the taxation of the country. This wealth, which was hardly known forty or fifty years ago, has grown, to the knowledge of every member of this House, almost beyond the dreams of avarice. Hardly any form of wealth in this country is so immense as the possession of land in urban areas. It has escaped up to the present moment not only its fair share towards the taxation of the country, but also towards rating. Here in the Finance Bill of this year is the attempt on the part of His Majesty's Government to ask owners of urban land values for the first time to pay some small portion of their immense wealth to the common stock of the country, and that is
<col>908</col>
the proposal that is an offence to noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
Now let me turn to these various land taxes and give some examples of how our old land system has operated in the past, and how it is not unjust that these taxes should really force these landowners to pay something more towards the taxation of the country. To guard myself against any misconception, I hope that your Lordships will allow me to say that in any instance given I do not desire or intend to attack any individual. It is the system that makes it possible, and it is against that system, quite apart from any individual, that this taxation is proposed. These land taxes are four in number. In the first place, there is the Increment Value Duty which exempts agricultural land. Then His Majesty's Government propose to value the land of the country, and its value to-day will be stated. When on any future occasion property changes hands and it appears that it has increased in value, then, subject to certain deductions, the Government propose that twenty per cent. of that increase should be a contribution to the National Exchequer. There is no confiscation; no taking away of anything that now belongs to any landlord in the country. The only part which is made subject to taxation is any future increase that may happen. We are not dealing with present values or prairie value. We take a percentage of the future profit which is not due to any expenditure on the part of the landlord himself.<lb/>
Let me give one or two instances. Thirty years ago on the failure of a prominent financier in the City of London his business premises in Lombard Street were sold for about &#x00A3;37 per foot; rather an extravagant price for that day. Now, so far as can be judged from sales in the City, land in that neighbourhood is being sold at no less than &#x00A3;50 per foot. Considering the fact that the landlord has made no contribution to increase the value of that land, that seems to us to be a proper subject for taxation. Then there is another instance. In 1865 a piece of land on the foreshore of the Thames near the Temple changed hands for &#x00A3;8,250. In 1870, at the cost of the ratepayers, the Victoria Embankment was built. A year afterwards the London School Board bought that same piece of land and had to pay no less than &#x00A3;26,420. We say, and who can
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0461"/>
<col>909</col>
deny? that that vast increase in five years was a proper subject for taxation.<lb/>
But this question does not affect only London. Let us take Manchester. In 1780 land at the corner of Piccadilly and Mosley Street was sold for a little under 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a yard. Six years ago that same land was sold at the rate of from &#x00A3;59 to &#x00A3;70 a yard. There was some land in Cross-street which was sold in 1881 at the rate of &#x00A3;60 a yard. In May, 1900, it was sold at the rate of &#x00A3;120 a yard. There was also another case in which, I think, in a short period the amount which was given for a piece of land in. Manchester was even larger. I quote these increases as examples of what in the opinion of His Majesty's Government are proper subjects of taxation.<lb/>
Now, let us turn to the Reversion Duty, a duty on leases, in which again there are exemptions for agricultural property and certain other exemptions to which I need not now refer. On the determination of any lease ten per cent. is payable upon the increased value. Here again, let us take the provinces. In South-street and Broad-street, Sheffield, a gentleman held land at a ground rent of &#x00A3;5 1<i>s</i>. per annum. For the renewal of that lease a sum of no less than &#x00A3;150 was paid. There is no question here of what the gentleman in possession may have been paying to middlemen. That will not become subject to taxation. What will be subject to taxation is the difference between the &#x00A3;5 and the &#x00A3;150, upon which, in our opinion, it is only fair the ground landlord should pay ten per cent. In Birmingham four years ago there were some premises in New-street, the ground rent of which was &#x00A3;975, which was fourteen times more than had been paid before. In Broad-street there was a public-house of which the ground rent had been &#x00A3;40 per annum. It was put up to auction and no less than &#x00A3;840 per annum was given for that lease.<lb/>
Then we come to the Undeveloped Land Duty, and I cannot help thinking from what has been said chiefly by Lord Camperdown that it is this duty against which most of the objections of noble Lords opposite are directed. This is a duty of one halfpenny on the site value. Here, again, there are exemptions in favour of agricultural land. I do not know that there is a tax in the whole programme of His Majesty's Government which has been more urgently demanded
<col>910</col>
by municipalities throughout the country than this tax on undeveloped land. I will show shortly why it is that this is asked for. There was a debate in the House of Commons some years ago upon a Bill for the taxation of these values, and Sir Albert Rollit, then the Conservative member for South Islington, spoke in favour of the Bill and quoted the following resolution, which had been unanimously adopted by the Association of Municipal Corporations:&#x2014;" That it is urgent to provide some means by which owners of land, whether occupied or vacant, shall contribute directly to local rates." I hope your Lordships will bear with me while I give one or two illustrations as to the way in which it will work. At Felixstowe a certain plot of one and a-half acres of undeveloped land paid only a few shillings in rates and taxes. That land was wanted for the site of an hotel, and the terms of purchase were that &#x00A3;2,000 should be paid for the land and &#x00A3;500 more when the magistrates granted a licence for the building. In that case the plot was wanted for the development of the town, and the land was worth apparently not less than &#x00A3;1,400 an acre. It was withheld, and paid only a few shillings in rates and taxes. Is it an extreme or revolutionary proposal that the landlord should pay in proportion to the value of the land? The taxation proposed in the Budget would have amounted to only &#x00A3;5 a year in that case.<lb/>
The demand for this tax comes from all parts of the country. The demand which has come specially under my notice is that from watering places, which suffer considerably when the owners of land outside the towns refuse to allow that land to be built upon. As a result the rates in the towns are heavier than they need be. The land is held up until a very large sum&#x2014;often a fancy price&#x2014;is paid for it. We do not object to a fancy price being obtained, but we say that until the owners get those fancy prices they ought to pay their proportion towards the rates which their neighbours have to bear.<lb/>
I shall now read to your Lordships a rather long quotation from the Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes, which reported in favour of the rating of undeveloped land in 1885&#x2014;
<quote>"At present, land available for building in the neighbourhood of our populous centres, though its capital value is very great, is probably producing
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0462"/>
<col>911</col>
a small yearly return until it is let for building. The owners of this land are rated, not in relation to the real value, but to the actual annual income. They can thus afford to keep their land out of the market, and to part with only small quantities, so as to raise the price beyond the actual monopoly price which the land would command by its advantages of position. Meantime, the general expenditure of the town on improvements is increasing the value of their property, If this land were rated at, say, four per cent. on its selling value, the owners would have a more direct incentive to part with it to those who are desirous of building, and a two-fold advantage would result to the community. First, all the valuable property would contribute to the rates, and thus the burden on the occupiers would be diminished by the increase in the rateable property. Secondly, the owners of the building land would he forced to offer their land for sale, and thus their competition with one another would bring down the price of building land, and so diminish the tax in the shape of ground rent, or price paid for land which is now levied on urban enterprise by the adjacent land owners, a tax, be it remembered, which is no recompense for any industry or expenditure on their part, but is the natural result of the industry and activity of the townspeople themselves. Your Majesty's Commissioners would recommend that these matters should be included in legislation when the law of rating comes to be dealt with by Parliament."</quote>
With regard to wayleaves, there is an almost classic example of their value and it is the only example I shall inflict on your Lordships. It is a case in Monmouthshire in which it is stated that the landlord receives no less than &#x00A3;12,300 per annum in respect of the tolls levied on coal carried on a railway through his park. Five per cent. is not a revolutionary amount to take from such wealth.<lb/>
Now we come to the question of Land Valuation which, as I understand when the matter is generally considered, is the only part of the attack which is seriously alleged against the Government. Now with regard to that, it is perfectly obvious that you cannot possibly raise the money on these various Land Taxes unless you begin by valuing the land. Then where is the "tacking?" In the course of the debate noble Lords sitting opposite have charged the Government with tacking. Will they explain exactly to what section of the Finance Bill they refer and what portions of the Bill could possibly have been left out in view of the demand there is this year for increased revenue? The fact of the matter is that what we need most of all in regard to land is a new standard&#x2014;that we should have the same standard of value when the landlord pays to the community as when the community pays to the landlord. At the present moment the two amounts are
<col>912</col>
flagrantly different. There was a meeting of the Glasgow Town Council in 1908 at which a resolution was adopted by thirty to fourteen in favour of the principle of the taxation of land values. It is no wonder they should do that in Glasgow, which suffers so largely from most of the evils of overcrowding and of slums to which our large towns are so subject.<lb/>
In London one-fifth of the land within the boundaries of the County is vacant land. Let us think of the result of that on the rates of London. That land escapes paying on its real value towards the rates of the County of London. It is not surprising that eminent financiers and economists should desire that these people should pay according to the actual value of their land. Complaints come from every part of the County. I will take an example from Oxted. Land is there rated at 13<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. per acre; the landlord when he was going to sell it asked &#x00A3;600 per acre and made various demands and restrictions with regard to its use. That is an example of the different standard adopted by the landlord when he is asking the community to pay him money and when it is a question of paying rates for the benefit of the community. That is an inconsistency which the Government would be very glad in some measure to see altered. We have this demand from the municipalities of the country. The system is not uncommon either abroad or in the Colonies. I regret to notice among the absences from the Front Bench opposite that of Viscount St. Aldwyn. It is easier to praise him in his absence than in his presence, but I may say he is an almost unrivalled authority on matters of finance. We regret the noble Viscount's absence because he never speaks without commanding respect on both sides of the House. He has expressed himself in times gone by as not wholly opposed to this system of taxation or some attempt to secure some part of the value for the benefit of the community. May I give one or two instances how this tax proposed by the Government will work in actual practice?<lb/>
I have taken the practical effects of the Budget upon an agricultural estate within my own acquaintance. It is an agricultural estate which comprises some small amount of land near towns. At the present moment the Income Tax payable upon that estate, which has a gross rental of &#x00A3;22,900, is &#x00A3;897. Now, in the future the tax on that with the Super Tax added to it will amount
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0463"/>
<col>913</col>
to &#x00A3;1,170&#x2014;an increase of only &#x00A3;273. That, really considering the large deficit and the demands that are being made upon every section of the community, does not seem to me to be a very large demand to make upon agriculture even in its present depressed condition. There are some small parts of the estate near towns, some thirty or forty acres, or at the utmost a total of fifty-six acres. These fifty-six acres are worth &#x00A3;10,000 for the purposes of Undeveloped Land Duty, and upon them the total duty payable, comes to &#x00A3;20 16<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. I should like to point out, in this connection, that it is always possible for a landowner who finds himself in the position of being expected to pay Undeveloped Land Duty to rid himself of that painful necessity either by developing the land or by selling it to somebody else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03430"><member>A NOBLE LORD</member><membercontribution>: Find someone to buy it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03431"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: If no one buys it, it has not a market value and therefore the owner does not have to pay any Undeveloped Land Duty. [Cries of dissent.] I begin to understand the hostility of noble Lords opposite to this duty, but I do not think the colleagues of the noble Lords in another place imagine that if land is not worth the money, taxes are payable. The valuers to be appointed are going to treat it subject to the various rights of appeal which are given, and if the noble Lord wall turn to Section 16, subsection 2, of the Act, he will see that land which is not developed and which cannot be developed by the erection of dwelling-houses and buildings for trade and industry other than agriculture, will not be liable to this Undeveloped Land Duty. I have no doubt that noble Lords opposite will take the opportunity to-morrow to consult their friends as to whether this is accurate or not. I have a Return here which was made to your Lordships on the subject of Scottish estates; but I will not deal with that at this late hour of the night. I will make the briefest reference to the Return moved for by Mr. Walter Long and which is to be found on "White Paper 225." It deals with the amount of public charges falling on owners of property worth &#x00A3;100, &#x00A3;1,000, &#x00A3;10,000 and &#x00A3;100,000, or if invested in Consols and Ordinary Shares of an Industrial Company yielding five per cent.<lb/>
This is a very instructive Return and I hope your Lordships will interest yourselves
<col>914</col>
in it because the information it contains will go far to allay the fears which undoubtedly exist as to the operation of the Budget. But there is one set of figures in my possession which are not the subject of a Parliamentary Return. They are important because they deal with the comparative annual burdens imposed by the Budget proposals this year and last year in respect of Income Tax, Super Tax, and Death Duties on estates of the capital value of &#x00A3;50,000, &#x00A3;100,000, &#x00A3;250,000, &#x00A3;500,000 and &#x00A3;1,000,000. Each of these estates, for the purposes of comparison, has been taken as yielding an average return of three per cent., and, in order to bring in the Death Duties, the owner is taken as insuring himself against Death Duties on a 3 per cent. basis with an assumed expectation of life at twenty years, and leaving the net capital value unaltered after payment of the Death Duties. Take, first of all, the capital value of &#x00A3;50,000. Last year that would have paid in Income Tax and an insurance against Death Duties, &#x00A3;168 2<i>s</i>. Under the proposals of the Government that same estate will now pay &#x00A3;240 1<i>s</i>. On an estate of &#x00A3;100,000 the previous year's charge was &#x00A3;375 3<i>s</i>.; under our proposals it will be &#x00A3;567 7<i>s</i>. On an estate of &#x00A3;250,000 the tax payable last year was &#x00A3;1,144; this year it will be &#x00A3;1,714. On an estate of half a million the burden last year would have been &#x00A3;2,498, while now it will be &#x00A3;3,746; and on an estate of the value of one million the Income Tax and insurance against Death Duties together last year would have been &#x00A3;5,472, whilst under the present proposals it will be &#x00A3;9,096 7<i>s</i>. We fully realise, especially when we come to larger amounts, that there is a much larger burden put upon these estates, but, in our opinion, it is on those larger estates that the larger amounts ought to be paid. And really, taking into consideration the total value of an estate of not less than one million, I do not know that the annual charge of &#x00A3;9,096 can be described as excessive. We admit quite freely and frankly that we intend and wish to see that wealth shall pay its share towards the general taxation of the country.<lb/>
Let me answer one or two questions which were put by the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry. He made a special point about the Budget proposals being unpopular in the country. I have not discovered that. Certainly the by-elections since the Budget proposals have been before the country do
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0464"/>
<col>915</col>
not show anything of the sort. Whatever may have been the result as between the two wings of the progressive forces, it is clear that in Bermondsey, the High Peak, Cleveland, and the Mid Division of Derbyshire there have been majorities in favour of the Budget proposals. The noble Marquess spoke of the amount of unemployment in the Wear District. Employment in the shipbuilding districts generally is better than it was a year ago in spite of the Budget. The percentage of unemployment in the Wear district at the end of October, 1909, was thirty-two per cent. whilst at the end of October, 1908, it was fifty per cent. It follows that unemployment there has considerably diminished since a year ago in spite of the Budget proposals. A special reference was made to the building trade; but here again we find that although employment in October last was slack it was rather better than it was a year ago.<lb/>
Now, I may perhaps be excused if, even in his absence, I make one reference to the speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition in this House. He told us that if any speech had been made by the Leader of the House he would have expected to have been asked the question as to what alternative plan would be suggested by the Opposition. It would not have occurred to me to put such a question. I should not have expected to find in the noble Marquess or in his noble colleagues who sit beside him, a new Chancellor of the Exchequer available for the next Conservative Administration. We seem to be writing our new constitutional history rather quickly. Last week we had this unprecedented Amendment put down, and this week we have the financial proposals of the Conservative Party outlined in the House of Lords. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has told us, quite frankly, that he is in favour of a tax upon imports. His alternative to a tax upon Urban Land Values is a tax upon manufactured goods, and his alternative for the Budget taxes is a tax upon food. Well, if that is the cry with which the next Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Conservative Administration is going to the country, noble Lords on this side of the House have no reason to quarrel with the programme which he has put forward. But it seems to me that noble Lords opposite have made very light of the chaos that will ensue from the adoption of this Amendment. They have offered their
<col>916</col>
assistance in order to help the Government to reduce the chaos to the least possible amount; but I do not think noble Lords opposite exactly realise what that offer involves.<lb/>
Do they really suppose that the Commons of England will appear at the Bar of of the House of Lords next week, on bended knee and with cap in hand, and ask your Lordships to be good enough to pass a Budget which will commend itself to your Lordships&#x2014;a Budget which will include the tobacco tax, because it seems you do not object to that, but which, apparently with the exception of the duties on stamps, petrol, and motor cars, will cut out every other financial provision suggested by the Government? Do noble Lords see that such an action will be to make this House supreme in financial affairs, and to give the House of Lords the power of the purse? Is it likely, at the beginning of the twentieth century that to this House&#x2014;a non-elective and non-representative House&#x2014;the Commons of the Realm will surrender the power of the purse? No, it is quite certain that whatever their action may be, it will not be on those lines. I do not hesitate to say that no more momentous or far-reaching step has been taken in the history of this country since Charles I raised his standard at Nottingham. Noble Lords opposite said, and said quite rightly, that they cared for no threats. None have yet been made. We do not wish to offer any threat. We content ourselves with a perfectly plain I statement of facts. And it is this. In the opinion of the Liberal Party&#x2014;I believe the unanimous opinion&#x2014;this House with its past record, with its present constitution, and with its powers as they exist at present, is unworthy and incapable of guiding the destinies of a great and mighty Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03432"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl began his speech by telling us that there had been no gratitude shown for the concession in the Budget made by the Government in regard to works of art. I always sympathise with a good man with a genuine grievance, and I am ready to extend to him my fullest gratitude; but I do not think it was a reasonable grievance, because this concession does not very much affect the main principles of the Budget, and it is to that main principle that the debate has been chiefly confined. The noble Earl commenced his speech with that good-natured grievance,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0465"/>
<col>917</col>
but he finished with a not too good-natured sneer at the state of affairs which neither the Leader of the Opposition nor noble Lords on this side of the House ever pictured to themselves as a desirable state of affairs. I do not know why the noble Earl has drawn a picture of the House of Commons kneeling at the Bar of the House in complete submission to your Lordships. I only hope it is not his desire that the picture shall be reproduced in posters during the forthcoming General Election.<lb/>
I hope your Lordships will excuse me from following the noble Earl in his discussion on the series of taxes to which he has addressed himself. I quite admit that it is possible to minimise the effect of this Budget by taking the taxes singly. In some cases the effect of the tax is not very great, but in others it is very great, while the cumulative effect of all the taxes is stupendous. That is the case of the Opposition in both Houses, and it is one to which no answer has yet been attempted in this debate. The noble Earl spoke a great deal on the subject of urban land, and his excuse for placing the tax upon it is that hitherto this land has escaped its fair share of taxation. I am not an unfortunate owner of urban land, but I felt considerable surprise at the statement of the noble Earl. It is not true that urban land has hitherto escaped its fair share of taxation. Have profits on urban land paid no Income Tax? Have sales of urban land entailed no Stamp Duty? Have no Estate Duties, Succession Duties, or Death Duties been paid on urban land? Surely urban land has paid exactly the same proportionate contribution to the Revenue as other kinds of property, and therein lies the injustice of the additional taxation. Our case is that you are putting more than one extra tax on urban land, and again I say therein lies the injustice of your proposals. The noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, quoted one or two cases and it was difficult to follow the figures, but I could not help feeling that in his Lombard-street case he gave us no reason why the increase in value of 1<i>s</i>. even should have been met by a fine to the Imperial Treasury. There may have been reasons, but the noble Earl did not tell us of them. The noble Earl quoted these cases as cases of a kind which the municipal authorities have desired to have power to deal with for years. My impression is that wherever in former years
<col>918</col>
municipal authorities have desired to inflict the fine in a case such as that stated by the noble Earl, their desire was to obtain that power in order to relieve the local rates in the particular locality; but that is not in the least the desire of the Government in this Budget.<lb/>
I do not desire to enter into details on the constitutional question, but I feel I am entitled at this period of the debate to call your Lordships' attention to one important matter to which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition drew attention yesterday. The noble Marquess cited two passages from the speeches of former Leaders of this House&#x2014;Earl Spencer and the late Marquess of Ripon&#x2014;laying it down conclusively that the Lords had a right to reject a Money Bill. That right was disputed by the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, but although we have since had speeches from three members of the Government, not once has there been any attempt to prove that those former Leaders did not know their business, and until that has been proved those quotations hold the field and prove our right to reject this or any other Finance Bill. I admit the astuteness with which that has been avoided, and also the astuteness of the noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, who was inclined to argue that it was even beyond our powers to discuss these Duties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03433"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I said that we had a legal right, but I did not think we had a constitutional right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03434"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: Whatever may be our disabilities the noble Lord pushed them to the extreme, because he even refused to argue the details of this Bill. This seems to me to be a pushing of the privilege of another place to a farcical extreme. My Lords, an attempt has been made to persuade as that there is no "tacking" in this Budget, and Lord Beauchamp went so far as to maintain that the valuation question was the only one even in the view of the Opposition which involved tacking. I say that it is not so; there has been tacking in the valuation proposals and there has also been tacking in the licensing proposals of the Budget. The noble Earl argued this question somewhat in detail and challenged us to prove in any way that there was "tacking" in the licensing proposals
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0466"/>
<col>919</col>
No one on this side of the House is in the Cabinet secrets, but I think I can supply a little evidence which bears most forcibly on this point. Your Lordships will remember the circumstances attending the Licensing Bill of last year. The Prime Minister stated that he intended to "stand or fall" by it. He did not fall, and I am not assuming too much in saying therefore that he stood by it. Some of his colleagues went farther, and actually threatened your Lordships and the brewers that if the Licensing Bill was not passed last year it would be included in a future Budget. The President of the Board of Trade, speaking in London in June, 1908, said that their brewing friends should remember that Budgets were beyond the control of the Lords, and that if the licensing trade refused the just and considerate provisions of this great temperance measure they would surely find that they had leapt from the frying pan into the fire. That was not an isolated statement. The First Lord of the Admiralty and other members of the Government made similar statements. It may be that these considerations were not in the least in the minds of Ministers when they drafted this part of the Finance Bill, but if that is so we have the right to ask at what particular date it was decided to throw over these declarations of policy by Cabinet Ministers of last year, and when it was definitely decided, in the words of the Lord Chancellor, that these duties were nothing but "pure finance."<lb/>
I desire very briefly to deal with the special way in which Ireland is affected by this Budget. I hope to show that I am not confining myself solely to Irish interests, but to throw a side light on the way in which it affects not only Ireland but other parts of the United Kingdom. There is no question whatever that this Budget is unpopular in Ireland. It is quite true that the Nationalist Members abstained from the Division on the Third Beading, but since then a great deal has happened, and a very large number of public authorities in Ireland have not only passed resolutions against the Budget, but have written letters to members of your Lordships' House who are strongly opposed to them in politics, beseeching them to do all they could to throw out this Budget. I have here a Nationalist paper, published in County Kilkenny and dated Saturday, Nov. 20, in which there are reports of meetings of six public bodies, all calling on the House of Lords to reject this
<col>920</col>
measure because of its injustice to Ireland. I do not wish to exaggerate the importance of these resolutions. Those of us who live in Ireland are more accustomed to see ourselves condemned than called on to take action, but it is fair to argue from these resolutions that there is very considerable dissatisfaction with this Budget in Ireland. This is rather peculiar because, as a matter of fact, as regards one particular tax, we ought to be very grateful, for under its licensing clauses we have been given very favourable special terms.<lb/>
On page 83 of the Bill you will find Scale 3, which is the scale of minimum licences to be paid both in the cases of publicans' licences and beerhouse licences. In Great Britain the minimum duty is &#x00A3;5 in non-urban areas and urban areas up to a population of 2,000, while in Ireland the &#x00A3;5 minimum extends to urban areas up to a population of 10,000. In Great Britain the minimum scale advances by degrees to &#x00A3;35; but in Ireland it never goes beyond &#x00A3;7 10<i>s</i>. With regard to beerhouse licences in Great Britain, the minimum duty fluctuates from &#x00A3;3 to &#x00A3;23; in Ireland it begins at &#x00A3;3, and never goes above &#x00A3;4. Your Lordships will see what a considerable concession this means to Ireland. Taking the three representative towns of Clonmel, with 11,000 inhabitants, of Cork, with 76,000, and of Dublin, with 290,000, the minimum publican's licence in all these cases will not go beyond &#x00A3;7 10<i>s</i>., whereas in similar towns in England it will be &#x00A3;20, &#x00A3;30 and &#x00A3;35; while the minimum beerhouse licences in Ireland will in all cases be &#x00A3;4, and in England &#x00A3;13, &#x00A3;20, and &#x00A3;23 10<i>s</i>. I can assure those of your Lordships who do not live in Ireland that there is no reason why we should be given this preferential treatment unless it be the fact that His Majesty's Government have always been very tender of Nationalist criticism in another place. But in spite of this concession, curiously enough the Budget is unpopular in Ireland, because it is realised that these duties are very high and are going to be very severe. Ireland is being punished by heavier duties because of the fact that the Licensing Bill was thrown out by your Lordships last year&#x2014;a Licensing Bill, by the way, that did not apply to Ireland. That is an eloquent reason for the unpopularity shown towards the Budget in Ireland.
One effect of this Budget cannot have been realised by the Government, and though it
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0467"/>
<col>921</col>
is not very important, perhaps one may be I forgiven for mentioning it as a sidelight upon the ignorance of the Government as regards their own proposals. One effect of the Budget has been to send up the price of milk. It is difficult to realise how that happened, but it appears that in Drogheda, where there is a consider-able brewing industry, the refuse from the mash-tun of the brewery provided the chief food for the cattle. The effect of these duties has been to very considerably decrease the output and, therefore to decrease the refuse from the mash-tun. The result has been that the cow-keepers have had to advance the price of milk by &#x00BD;<i>d</i>. per gallon. Your Lordships will remember that this is temperance legislation; this is driving people to drink water with a vengeance. Another point which concerns Ireland to which I wish to draw attention is the effect of the mineral duties. The provision in this Budget relating to these duties amounts to a breach of faith with which I beg to charge the Government. In the Land Act of 1903 provision was made that minerals, in the case of the sale of an estate, were to be reserved to the Land Commission, and it was further provided that, where these minerals were subsequently worked, if there was a profit the Land Commission were to take seventy-five per cent. and the original vendor was to get the remaining twenty-five per cent. The effect of the Government's Royalty Tax will be to reduce that twenty-five per cent., which was guaranteed to the vendor as the result of a Parliamentary bargain in 1903 by one and a-quarter per cent. It may be desirable that this reduction should be made, but it should not have been altered <i>sub silentio</i>, and without a single reference to the fact being made, so far as I am aware, by any member of the Government.<lb/>
I want now to draw attention to some very remarkable figures brought forward by the Secretary for Scotland this afternoon. He was comparing the effect of the Budget upon the poor man and upon the rich man, and he said that the poor man earning 30<i>s</i>. a week would pay 2<i>d</i>. in the pound in extra taxation while a rich man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year would only have to pay an extra 5<i>d</i>. in the pound. Why should the noble Lord select &#x00A3;5,000 and not &#x00A3;5,001? Was it because &#x00A3;5,000 just escaped the Super Tax, and &#x00A3;5,001 would have come within it? If we had been given &#x00A3;5,001 as well as &#x00A3;5,000 it would have
<col>922</col>
helped us to make a comparison, and the proportion of taxation would have been very different. The noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, has given us some other figures, and I hope they will be presented to Parliament, because unless they are before us in print it is difficult to follow them. It appears that the amount to be contributed by the owner of &#x00A3;1,000,000 will be &#x00A3;9,096. That seems to me a fairly high proportion of an income of &#x00A3;30,000 to go in taxes, and it must have an effect upon his spending and his employing power.<lb/>
The noble Earl told us that the Government were determined that wealth should pay its proportion of taxation. I noticed that there was no cheer to that statement from several of the very rich members of your Lordships' House who were sitting behind him at the time. It may not appear that 5<i>d</i>. in the pound is a very heavy increase for a rich man to bear, but Sir Felix Schuster, in an article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, has cited figures which give a very different impression from that given by the Secretary for Scotland. Sir Felix calculates that the Income Tax and provision for Death Duties alone upon an industry with a capital of half a million will swallow up &#x00A3;65,000 of that capital, or thirteen per cent. of it. That is only one figure of a great many that he has given. I desire to make this <i>caveat</i>, and to point out that there are figures in existence which give the impression that the effect of the new taxation is very much more severe than your Lordships would judge from the figures of the Secretary for Scotland.<lb/>
A great deal has been made by the Government of the point that this Budget puts no-new taxation on agricultural land. I shall be able to show that it puts very severe taxation on the occupiers of agricultural land in Ireland, and I think you will find comparable cases on this side of the water. Your Lordships are aware that there is a special form of ownership known in Ireland as tenant right. The Courts have told us that it was not the intention of Sir William Harcourt in 1894 that this tenant right should pay Death Duty. It was believed in Ireland at the time that this property was not to pay the duty, but the Commissioners merrily collected it until a test case&#x2014;the Attorney-General <i>v</i>. Robinson&#x2014;was tried in 1900, when it was laid down that this property was not liable for Death.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0468"/>
<col>923</col>
Duty. This Budget reverses that decision, with the result that five millions worth of agricultural property in Ireland will be liable for Death Duty annually. I have a concrete case which appeared in the Dublin papers, on the authority of a well-known solicitor practising in Sackville-street. It shows that in Ireland the pressure of this Budget is going to be very severe. The father of a family died prior to the introduction of the Budget, leaving to his son a farm of ninety acres&#x2014;a nice farm, but by no means exceptional in that country. The Poor Law valuation of the farm was &#x00A3;199 15<i>s</i>. and the judicial rent was &#x00A3;176 8<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. For the purposes of duty before the introduction of the Budget the value was &#x00A3;583 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and that sum was taken on the basis of a twenty-five years purchase at &#x00A3;23 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., the difference between the Poor Law valuation and the judicial rent. The Estate Duty on that sum worked out at &#x00A3;11 11<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. and the Legacy and Succession Duties were <i>nil</i>, so that the total duty payable was only &#x00A3;11 11<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. The son then agreed to purchase his holding, and obtained a twenty per cent. reduction&#x2014;a not unusual figure. The son died since the introduction of the Budget leaving the farm to his sister. In this case the duty, instead of being &#x00A3;11 11<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., is as follows. Under the Budget the Inland Revenue authorities say that the value of the tenant right is &#x00A3;1,500, and it will be noted that hitherto that was not assessed at all. The Estate Duty of three per cent. on &#x00A3;1,500 will be &#x00A3;45, and the Succession Duty at five per cent. on the same amount will be &#x00A3;75, so that the duty to be paid by the sister will be &#x00A3;120 in place of the &#x00A3;11 11<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. that was paid previously, or an increase of ten times the original amount. Yet the Government say that this Budget places no further burden on agricultural land &#x0021;<lb/>
Let us carry it farther. It is possible that as the daughter is a married woman she may desire to transfer the farm to her husband. This kind of thing is frequently
<col>924</col>
done in Ireland for family convenience, and hitherto it has been done under the authority of a 10<i>s</i>. stamp, but the charge will now be in this case &#x00A3;56 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. under this Budget, which the Government contend puts no further duties on agricultural land. Perhaps not, but it puts very severe duties on the people whose sole livelihood is derived from agricultural land. Let us sum up the whole situation. There are these new Stamp Duties, which will apply, I take it, to agricultural land in England, Scotland and Wales just as much as to Ireland, and at the same time you have 125 millions worth of property, taking the average time at which a particular property pays Estate, Succession, and Death Duties as once in every twenty-five years, which has been brought into the taxable area and which has never been in it before. A struggling industry like the Irish land industry, emerging as it is now from thirty years of depression and dissatisfaction, largely due to British legislation, is to have this further burden put upon it just at the moment when it is finding its feet. We in Ireland have been reminded very much lately of the generosity of the British Exchequer in financing the Land Act, but we cannot help noticing that the British Exchequer is doing its best to get something back at the very same moment. I regret to have troubled your Lordships at this late hour of the night, but I did not feel justified in giving a silent vote on this question under the special circumstances of the case bearing upon Ireland. Many people in that country who are not politically and naturally favourable to your Lordships' House are now appealing to your Lordships to at any rate give them a chance to make some declaration on the policy of this Budget&#x2014;a Budget which they believe to be very inimical to their best interests and to the welfare of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03440">Debate on the Amendment moved by the Marquess of Lansdowne to the Motion that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup> <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03441"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the very interesting speech which the noble Earl the Lord Steward delivered late last evening, he began with an observation which appeared to me rather to disparage the grave constitutional issue which your Lordships' House has now to consider, and he devoted his attention, as he said, rather to the dry facts of the Budget. My Lords, he went into great detail, but I am sorry to say that I do not think that all his facts are facts. Undoubtedly he thought they were facts, and undoubtedly they had been supplied by those painstaking gentlemen who help Ministers in distress with all sorts of information; but I think those of your Lordships, of which there are a good many present, who listened to the noble Lord are of opinion that his facts
<col>926</col>
required considerable correction. He seemed to think, for example, that the increment of value, of which he quoted instances drawn from various great urban communities in this country, bore no share in contributing to the taxation of the country. Of course, my Lords, if he had thought for a moment, he would have remembered that every pound which is added in the City of London, for example, to the value of land there, bears the burden of its increased rateable value to the rates, bears the burden of increased Income Tax to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, when the owner of it comes to die, bears the heavy burden of the Death Duties which his successor has to pay. I was not surprised, my Lords, as the noble Lord took, may I say, so imaginary a view of the facts of the case in that particular, that when he came to discuss the burden of taxation imposed by the Bill before your Lordships' House, he came to the conclusion that the increased burden was after all of a very moderate kind, not worthy of the amount of attention and trouble which your Lordships' House is giving to it on the present occasion.<lb/>
I tried to make a mental calculation of the noble Lord's figures as he described them. I think he told us, for example, that agricultural land bore no increased taxation, and yet, when he began to give us an illustration and spoke of an estate which he knew intimately&#x2014;an estate perhaps, I shall not be far wrong in thinking is to be found in Worcestershire, then the noble Earl, as far as I could calculate his figures, found that the increase of taxation would be thirty per cent. Well, my Lords, if you say that there is to be no taxation of agricultural land, and when the noble Lord who advances that contention instances agricultural property which he knows well, and we discover that the increase of taxation is thirty per cent. why then I think we have some standard upon which to calculate the accuracy of the noble Lord's conclusions. So he went on through realms of figures which he dealt with with his customary clearness and lucidity, and with regard to which, as far as I could make out, the increase of taxation varied between fifty and 100 per cent. This was the small increase, the insignificant increase, the Budget inflicts, which apparently the noble Earl hardly thought was worthy of the attention of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0470"/>
<col>927</col>
One other observation of the noble Earl attracted my attention. He seems to be persuaded that you can estimate the capacity of a man to bear the burden of taxation by the amount of his income. He said that a man who had &#x00A3;4,000 a year was not so rich as a man who had &#x00A3;5,000 a year, and he had, therefore, a shrewd suspicion that the man who had &#x00A3;5,000 a year could bear greater taxation than the man with &#x00A3;4,000 a year. That may be the shrewd suspicion of the noble Earl, but let me tell him that in numberless cases it is wholly inaccurate, as the noble Earl will himself recognise, if he will be good enough to follow me for a moment. A man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year might be a man with a large family. The man with &#x00A3;4,000 might be a bachelor. Which of the two is able to bear the greater burden of taxation? It is perfectly evident that the amount of a man's income is the most rough and ready test of the amount of taxation which he can bear to pay. But, my Lords, the case does not rest there. One man with &#x00A3;100,000 a year may live upon &#x00A3;2,000 a year and the remainder of his income may be invested in various works of public importance and utility. He may perhaps have lent it to the country to meet the charges for the administration of the country, or he may have put it into industrial enterprises and so ministered to the wealth and prosperity of the country. That is one way. Another man with &#x00A3;10,000 a year, a tenth part of the income of the first man I have instanced, may spend the whole &#x00A3;10,000 upon his own personal enjoyment and upon luxuries. Are we to say that the man who devotes nearly the whole of his income to public work or to industrial enterprise is a subject for greater taxation necessarily than the man of &#x00A3;10,000 a year who spends it all upon himself?<lb/>
It is manifest, my Lords, that this theory of what is called taxing a man's superfluities and of calculating his superfluities upon the gross amount of his income is about the most deceptive criterion which we can adopt. If you want to tax a rich man because you think he has a better time than a poor man, you are quite right. I agree with you. By all means let us tax wealth; but do not let us try to arrive at the comparative amount of a man's wealth by his income. What you ought to tax is not a man's income, but rather his expenditure. Let all these intelligent
<col>928</col>
painstaking men on the Treasury Bench devote their ingenuity to discovering how in reality they can best tax a man's luxuries and that which he spends on himself, and they will have a far sounder criterion of taxation than the heavy increasing burdens which they heap upon the Income Tax and which they now offer for your Lordships' acceptance. Now, my Lords, whatever opinion we may have upon this heavy burden of Income Tax, and this heavy burden of Death Duties which the present Budget seeks to heap upon the taxpayers of this country, at any rate I think the great majority of your Lordships will agree that a man's wealth can certainly not be calculated by the particular investment in which he has placed his money, and that a man who has invested his money in land ought not to be taxed heavier than a man who has invested his money in anything else. That, my Lords, is of course the portion of the finance of the Budget which has received the greatest attention in your Lordships' House and elsewhere, and it is not a matter to be treated as lightly as the noble Earl treated it last night.<lb/>
This particularising of a certain class of wealth has undoubtedly produced in the public mind a feeling of profound unrest, of profound distrust. I noticed that in his speech yesterday the Secretary for Scotland tried to minimise the effect which the present proposals have had upon those who are best qualified to judge of the money market of this country and of the feeling of the City of London. He had been furnished with a series of figures like the Lord Steward&#x2014;I am not quite sure whether the noble Lord quite understood his own figures&#x2014;but I say this with great respect to him, that he might have saved himself the trouble of describing them to your Lordships' House, because we did not want second-hand evidence on the point at all. We had got first-hand evidence. We had heard the speech already of one of the greatest authorities in the City of London. My noble friend who sits behind me, Lord Revelstoke, made a speech which created a profound impression upon your Lordships' House. He did not have to go to somebody's private secretary in order to get up his figures. He lives in the City of London; he knows every feature of the money market; and upon his great responsibility he stated to your Lordships' House what impression
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0471"/>
<col>929</col>
the Budget had made upon the City of London.<lb/>
I have ventured to make these observations upon the financial effect of the Budget, because I should be sorry if it should appear even that so humble a member of this Bench as myself approved of the Government proposals. But that is not the most important issue which your Lordships have to try in the present debate. What is that issue? That issue, my Lords, is this, whether or not your Lordships' House has the right and whether or not your Lordships' House has the duty to assent to the Motion of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition and to decline to give your consent to the Finance Bill of the year. Now the noble Earl the Lord Steward did not deal with this issue last night; at least, I think he did not. If I mis-represent him, he shall correct me. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack did deal with it. Was it only a false impression on my part&#x2014;but I thought he dealt with it with some hesitation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03442"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03443"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Then that was a mistake. But the noble and learned Lord left a good deal out. For instance, there were my noble friend's quotations from two leaders of your Lordships' House, two Liberal leaders, my Lords There was the quotation from &#x0021; Lord Spencer, and there was the quotation from Lord Ripon, both asserting the rights of your Lordships' House in this matter. The noble and learned Lord upon the Woolsack made no reference to either one or the other. He did not deny that, in the mouths of the two most respected members of the great Party opposite, the lights of the House of Lords had been asserted. Did he differ from them? My Lords, I do not think it is necessary for us to go back even so far as the statement of Lord Spencer or the statement of Lord Ripon. I wonder whether the noble and learned Lord has in his mind the debate upon the Scottish Valuation Bill this time last year?<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord delivered a very important speech upon the Second Reading of that Bill. It was full of that sweet reasonableness with which we are so familiar from the noble and learned Lord. He was most anxious that your Lordships' House should pass the Second Reading of
<col>930</col>
that Bill, and he used the argument, familiar in his mouth, that after all the Scottish Valuation Bill did not amount to very much, that it was only the machinery of valuation, and that there could be no harm in providing that machinery. "No," said the noble and learned Lord, "the important matter will come later." My Lords, the important matter the noble and learned Lord argued was not the machinery of valuation, but the Rating Bill which would follow on that machinery of valuation, and he proceeded to try and reassure my noble friends sitting on this side of the House that they were perfectly safe in passing the Valuation Bill, because there was the Rating Bill in the future still to be considered. What words did the noble and learned Lord use, speaking on March 25 of last year? This is how he dealt with it. He was aware that in some quarters of the House, Liberal quarters, I suppose, difficulties might be suggested when we reached the Rating Bill, if we ever did. The noble and learned Lord speaking of that Bill said this, "It is a Money Bill, we are told"&#x2014;the Rating Bill. Your Lordships will mark those words. "Well, if a Money Bill is brought forward, this House has always the power to throw it out." In order that I may show your Lordships that the noble and learned Lord was treating this subject generally, and that he was not confining his attention to a particular class of Money Bills, I will read the words which immediately follow. The noble and learned Lord was quite aware of the familiar distinction which is made between rejecting and amending Money Bills, and the fact that he recalled it in his observations shows that he was dealing with the subject generally. He said: "It is the question of amending Money Bills; that is a question of privilege. But as to the question of throwing out Money Bills, your Lordships have the most ample powers."<lb/>
That was the view of the noble and learned Lord in March, 1908. I will leave the noble and learned Lord to explain the change which has taken place in his opinions since the time when he was so anxious that your Lordships should pass the Valuation Bill until this moment when he is so anxious that your Lordships should not reject the Finance Bill. Now, this Scottish Valuation Bill is a Bill of the greatest importance in this controversy, because it is a Bill which your Lordships dealt with in the ordinary manner which you are accustomed to apply to any legislative measure.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0472"/>
<col>931</col>
It is a Bill which your Lordships claimed the right to reject if you pleased; which you did not in fact reject, but which you did amend, and your right to amend no one called in question. Further, it was a Bill of the greatest importance. The principle of it was not, in truth, confined to Scotland. The noble Earl the Leader of the House told us in the debate that if it were passed, it would, of course, afterwards be made to apply to England. It contained within itself very important ulterior results. For example, it was defended by members of the Government on the ground that it was important as leading up to legislation which should force unwilling sellers to part with their land, and I think at the time also it was defended by members of the Government upon the ground that it afforded a ready and reliable criterion for compensation when land was purchased by the State compulsorily.<lb/>
All those ulterior consequences were contained in that Bill. It was, in fact, the forerunner of a complete series of Acts of Parliament of the most important and intricate character. These qualities in the Scottish Valuation Bill of last year are, of course, not confined to that particular Valuation Bill, but are to be found equally strongly in the Valuation Clauses of the Finance Bill which is at present under discussion. Those principles&#x2014;the principle, that is to say, of universal valuation, the principle which that is intended to lead up to of compelling an unwilling seller to part with his land; the further principle which it is intended to lead up to, namely the affording of a proper criterion for the payment of the State in the case of compulsory purchase&#x2014;all those consequences and principles have been reaffirmed by members of the Government as being contained in the Valuation Clauses of the Finance Bill which is now under discussion. Then the noble Earl the Lord Steward quoted last night the same passage from the Report of the Royal Commission on Housing as had been quoted by the noble and learned Lord upon the Woolsack in the same speech to which I have already referred on the Second Reading of the Scottish Valuation Bill. That passage in the Report pointed out that one of the effects of the taxation of capital value would be to force unwilling sellers to part with their land.<lb/>
Those subjects which the Scottish Valuation Bill contained, and which in that case
<col>932</col>
we were allowed to deal with, are contained in quite as great a measure in the present Bill with which we are not allowed to deal. How can that possibly be defended? How can any member of your Lordships' House&#x2014;I do not care in what quarter of the House he sits&#x2014;rise in his place and maintain that it is perfectly legitimate for your Lordships' House to deal with all these intricate principles, and with the clauses which are intended to carry them out, in the Scottish Valuation Bill of last year, and that your Lordships are absolutely precluded from having any say whatever to exactly the same proposals, only rather wider, which are contained in the Finance Bill of the present year? The thing is not arguable at all, my Lords. It is quite manifest, once it is admitted, as it was last year by the Government, that the Valuation Bill was an ordinary Bill capable of being discussed on the First and Second Readings, in Committee, on Report, and on Third Reading in your Lordships' House, that we are bound, if there is any logic and consistency left in public life, to apply the same conclusions to the Bill which is at present under discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03444"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Lord will allow me to offer the explanation for which he was good enough to ask in somewhat severe terms? When I addressed the House on Monday night, the House will bear me witness that I drew the most pointed distinction between Money Bills which were mixed up with other matters, or which were isolated and separate Bills by themselves on the one hand, and Money Bills which contained the Supply for the year on the other hand. My statement on Monday night was limited wholly to the Money Bills which dealt with the Supply for the year. The noble Lord may think I am right, or he may think I am wrong, but he has no right to suggest something more than inconsistency in what I said. Further than that, I adhere to every word I said with regard to the Scottish Valuation Bill last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03445"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I never suggested, as the noble and learned Lord seems to think, that there was any charge in my mouth against him other than inconsistency. I am perfectly well aware that the noble and learned Lord, and it is almost impertinence for me to say so, enjoys a loftiness and integrity of character which no other member of your Lordships' House surpasses. On the contrary,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0473"/>
<col>933</col>
It is because of the noble and learned Lord's high character and his great reputation in your Lordships' House, that I felt it to be my duty to correct the impression which I think the noble and learned Lord's speech left upon us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03446"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I of course most heartily accept the noble Marquess's explanation in the spirit in which he offers it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03447"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord's observations on the Second Reading of the Scottish Valuation Bill in March of last year were of a perfectly general character, because I have quoted his words accurately; and I think, in the discussions of that year, unless I am very much mistaken, noble Lords opposite were at pains to prove that in respect to the privileges of the House of Commons there was no distinction between one kind of Finance Bill and another. And I remember very well, in the discussion on the Amendments to the Old Age Pensions Bill, that an old Resolution of a corrupt Parliament of Charles II was trotted out by noble Lords opposite in order to show that we had no right to amend that Bill. This distinction, let me assure the noble and learned Lord, between the Finance Bill of the year and other Money Bills, although it might have been hinted at from this side of the House, was always repudiated from the other side of the House until the noble and learned Lord spoke the night before last. I was contending, when the noble and learned Lord interrupted me, although I do not complain of his interruption for a moment, that the precedent of the Valuation Bill of last year made it absolutely clear that the same measure of liberty in your Lordships' House which was conceded in regard to that Scottish Bill must, logically and consistently, be conceded in the case of the Valuation Clauses in the Finance Bill now under discussion.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I must say a word upon the Licensing Clauses. I am relieved of the necessity of going into the question of licensing, your Lordships will be glad to hear, except very lightly; because, in an admirable speech which my noble friend Lord Donoughmore made rather late last night, he dealt with the very point to which I wish to call your Lordships' attention. Therefore, I will touch upon it, if your Lordships will
<col>934</col>
allow me, in a very summary manner. The contention on the part of His Majesty's Government is that the Licensing Clauses are only a very ordinary extension of methods of taxation with which the country is perfectly familiar; that they are not in any way designed for any other purpose except that of raising revenue; and that they cannot be accused for a moment, with any shadow of justification, of infringing the privileges of your Lordships' House. But, my Lords, if that be so, if it be true that the Licensing Clauses are merely ordinary methods of taxation, how do the members of the Government sitting in your Lordships' House account for the kind of observations which were made to the country by their own colleagues after the rejection of the Licensing Bill last year? My noble friend Lord Donoughmore quoted several of His Majesty's Ministers in the admirable speech which he delivered last night. I am afraid I must repeat one of his quotations, but it shall only be one.<lb/>
I want to cite to your Lordships the testimony of Mr. Winston Churchill, the President of the Board of Trade. I should like to remind your Lordships that the question which I am discussing is whether it is true or not true to say that the Licensing Clauses of the Bill of this year are or are not an attempt to evade the decision at which your Lordships' House arrived upon the Licensing Bill of last year. Mr. Winston Churchill, speaking, I am not quite sure whether it was immediately after the rejection of the Bill or not, but in July of last year&#x2014;I am told that it was before, but by the tenor of the speech he was referring I to the action of your Lordships' House&#x2014;used these words&#x2014;"I say to our brewing friends"&#x2014;the House is familiar with the refined style of the President of the Board of Trade&#x2014;" when they are gathered together in deep consultation around the flowing bowl, when they are drinking the health of the House of Lords, when they are cheering for an Assembly which boasts that it will defy the will of the masses of the people, let them remember that Budgets are beyond the control of the House of Lords, and that if the licensed trade refuse the just and considerate provisions of a great temperance measure, they may easily find that they have leapt from the frying pan into the fire."<lb/>
My Lords, is it not quite evident what the President of the Board of Trade meant? Why, there is not a Minister on that Front
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0474"/>
<col>935</col>
Bench opposite who will deny it. What he meant when he spoke then was this: that it was no good for the liquor trade to look to the House of Lords to throw out the Licensing Bill, because if your Lordships' House did throw out the Licensing Bill the Government would resort to the Budget in order to give a harder measure even to the liquor trade by the provisions of the Budget than were proposed in the Licensing Bill itself. How can the noble and learned Lord come down to your Lordships' House on this Bill, and the Lord Steward, and all the other Ministers, and tell us that this Budget has nothing to do with the rejection of the Licensing Bill last year? Why&#x0021; Ministers themselves prophesied that they would undertake the evasion of your Lordships' decision upon the Licensing Bill by putting it into the Budget. And they have done so. Why is it worth while to deny it? I cannot conceive why the noble and learned Lord and his friends spend so much time and trouble in denying a thing which is so very obvious.<lb/>
My Lords, there is no accident about this. This is all designed. It is quite obvious what was going to happen months ago; and indeed anyone who listened with care to the speech of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack would see that it is not the rejection of this Finance Bill which troubles him. It is not the outrageous breach of the Constitution which we are told is what he cares so much about. It is the rejection of all the Bills that he objects to&#x2014;not merely Bills protected by this alleged Resolution of the House of Commons' privileges, but all the other Bills which come before your Lordships from another place, and over which the power of your Lordships' House is undoubted. The noble and learned Lord assents to that; therefore it follows that the real issue is not whether your Lordships' House is or is not to have the right to reject a Finance Bill, but whether it is or is not to have the right to reject any Bill. That is the real issue. That is the issue which is really before the House and the country; and all this parade of old constitutional forms is merely so much make-believe to conceal the real issue which the Liberal Government desire to force upon the country.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, that being so, let us apply the conclusion to which I have
<col>936</col>
ventured to bring your Lordships' House. The House of Lords is not to be allowed to amend or reject any Bill which the Commons insist upon. That is really the issue. Do any members of your Lordships' House approve of such a change? I doubt it. I doubt whether there is any man! There is the noble Earl, Lord Russell, who spoke last night. If he will allow me to say so with great respect, the noble Earl with all his ability is the victim of one or two fads. But, like other people with fads, he dislikes everybody else's fads, and there are several fads for which the Government have made themselves responsible which he very much dislikes, and he has used his power and his ability in your Lordships' House in order to try and correct those fads. If he has his way and this Finance Bill is passed, and the power of your Lordships' House to reject any Bill is thereby destroyed, he will have to put up with all the fads which come from the House of Commons.<lb/>
Very well, I turn from the noble Earl to the right rev. Prelate who presides over the diocese of Birmingham. The right rev. Prelate has recommended your Lordships to pass this Bill. He is anxious for the re-adjustment of taxation. I think his ideal is the re-adjustment of wealth by means of taxation&#x2014;a very dangerous doctrine, may I say with great respect, for anybody to preach; and, above all, a very dangerous doctrine to come from such a quarter without a very careful explanation of what is meant by it. My Lords, if you legalised picking pockets, that would be a re-adjustment of wealth by means of taxation. I do not think the right rev. Prelate realised, without explanation, how profoundly demoralising such an observation really is. Because, speaking with all his great authority and knowledge, he practically says to the masses of the people, who have got the power: "You have got covetous desires; gratify them; have a re-adjustment of wealth by means of taxation." That is the right rev. Prelate's ideal. But that is not what the right rev. Prelate is principally interested in. There are other things, and things for which I profoundly respect him. He wishes to see a reform of the Poor Law. He wishes for a just settlement of the education question. If your Lordships pass this Budget; if you assent to the doctrine of the noble and learned Lord upon the Woolsack, you will not be allowed to have any voice in the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0475"/>
<col>937</col>
reform of the Poor Law. The truth is that almost any public measure can be expressed in terms of the Finance Bill or of the Appropriation Bill, but most of all the Poor Law. It is all a question of rates.<lb/>
Then there is the Education Bill. Let me illustrate my point. The other day there was a decision by the Courts of Law in what is called the Swansea case. That was a decision that it was incumbent upon the local authority to pay Voluntary school teachers at the same rate as Council school teachers. It is essential that that equality should be maintained, or otherwise, of course, the Voluntary school system could be swept away in a moment. Nothing would be easier than to reverse the judgment in the Swansea case by a clause in the Appropriation Bill. You would merely have to say under the Appropriation Bill that there should be a certain sum of money allocated to Council school teachers which shall not be available for Voluntary school teachers, and the thing is done. The Swansea judgment is reversed on the doctrine of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, supported by the Bishop of Birmingham. Your Lordships' House would have no voice in it whatever; you would have to accept it. My Lords, this is not theory, this is fact, because it has actually happened, not in the Swansea case, but in another case. There is a provision in a celebrated Act of Parliament that no grant of public money can be made for the building of schools. The education grants by the Education Acts are devoted to maintenance and so forth, but no grant can be given for the building of schools. That is as clear as possible in the Act of Parliament. But the other day the Government wanted to reverse that, and they did. That is a fact. They put it into the Appropriation Bill. It came up to your Lordships' House. I happened to be very much interested in these matters, and I took the opinion of the highest legal authority at my disposal as to whether that was legal, that the plain words of an Act of Parliament could be reversed by a provision of the Appropriation Bill. There was no doubt of his answer. He said, "Certainly; the Appropriation Act is an Act of Parliament just like any other; it cannot be questioned; it is an Act subsequent to the Education Act, and therefore it reversed the Education Act on that point." My Lords, it came up to your Lordships' House and the matter, although
<col>938</col>
of importance, was not of colossal importance and we thought that it was not worth while to provoke a constitutional crisis upon that alone, and therefore my noble friend who leads the Opposition was content to enter a protest on the subject. But the moral of the thing remains, and it is not only a theory; it is a fact, that any clause in any Act of Parliament can be reversed by either a clause in the Finance Bill, or a clause in the Appropriation Bill, and that when it is so reversed, according to the doctrine of the Government, it cannot be questioned in your Lordships' House; and there is no doubt that when it passes into law, these Acts are good law, and that the whole proceeding is complete.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, is not this a very serious matter for your Lordships' House? I wonder how many of those noble Lords who had thought of voting with the Government in the Division which will conclude this debate have reflected upon what their vote really meant. What they are asked to do, as I have ventured to point out to your Lordships, is to rob your Lordships' House of any share in the legislation of this country upon which the House of Commons choose to insist. My Lords, what is our claim on our side of the House? It is a very moderate claim. We do not pretend to an absolute veto on legislation. No, all we do is to say, "If you insist upon this legislation of which we cannot approve, the country shall decide between us." Mr. Winston Churchill, in the quotation which I have read to your Lordships, spoke of the Lords defying the masses of the people. Why, we appeal to the masses of the people. The truth is that the Democratic Party opposite have never understood the logic of their own position. If they believe in the people, why do they not trust the people? If they think that the ultimate source of power rests with the people, why should they object to apply to that source of power for the assent of the people to any great Act? I noticed that the Secretary for Scotland dealt with this point last night, and I think he repudiated the idea that our form of government was plebiscitory; that is to say, he held that the will of the people was not to be expressed direct, but through Parliament. Yes, my Lords; I do not differ from him on the general case. By all means let the people speak through their instruments and not directly, except upon
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0476"/>
<col>939</col>
great occasions. But if you take that view, the House of Lords is quite as much an instrument of the Constitution as is the House of Commons; and the two are necessary to make the complete whole.<lb/>
My Lords, we stand by appealing to the considered judgment of the people. That is of vital importance; because it may be that in a moment of mistaken excitement the people may return a majority to the House of Commons which does not express their considered opinion upon every subject. There was the case, for example, in regard to the Education Bill. That Bill was produced just after the House of Commons came fresh from a General Election. It may be that the people were a little weary of what is called the denominational controversy, and perhaps they were a little indignant at the increase of the rates which followed on the Act of 1904. A majority of the House of Commons proposed the Education Bill. Your Lordships' House took measures by amending that Bill in vital particulars to prevent it passing in the form in which it had been proposed, and we had then the advantage of the considered judgment of the people. Is there any one of your Lordships who will say that the Education Bill of 1906 was really popular among the masses of the people? When the people began to consider it, when they saw in black and white what the proposals of the Bill were; when they recognised that the awful spectre of secular education was standing at the gate; when they realised that the wishes of the parents themselves might be flouted by the operation of the Bill, they began to think that these stupid Conservatives and those simple religious men were in the right of it, that it was necessary to take steps to preserve the religious education of the people, and that it was essential that the parents' rights should be vindicated. And so the more the Bill was considered the less it was liked; yet, but for your Lordships' House that Bill would have been passed into law. In the result it seems that the considered judgment of the people is essential to the working of our Constitution. To that considered judgment we appeal; to our masters, my Lords; yes and your (the Government's) masters too, and by that judgment we will abide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03448"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it will be a matter of satisfaction to your Lordships,
<col>940</col>
in view of what we are anticipating, that my intervention in this debate will not detain your Lordships more than a very few minutes. I do not propose to enter into the merits of the controversy which this Bill raises, either as to the direct, that is to say the financial issues raised, or as to the indirect, or constitutional questions, which are implicitly involved in the vote that will be given. What I wish to do, on behalf of many Bishops who are absent and of a few who are here, is to state in the fewest possible words the position which they take, and take deliberately, in this matter. My Lords, I attach, and I know that many of your Lordships attach, real importance to the presence in Parliament of those who are not only the most ancient part of the Legislature, but are named first in the preamble to every Act of Parliament on the Statute Book&#x2014;the Lords Spiritual. That the circumstances of their lives and the character of their daily work give them, of necessity, peculiar opportunties of knowing about and handling certain questions which arise, and which must arise, in every Legislature in the world is, I think, both undisputed and indisputable. If I look back along the range of the subjects in the discussion of which we Bishops have been privileged to bear a part, and sometimes an important part, during the fifteen years, to take those alone, that I have had the honour of a seat in this House, I find it to include practically all those questions&#x2014;moral, religious, educational, social&#x2014;with which this House has constantly to deal. They range from Poor Law Reform and Prison Reform to University or Ecclesiastical Reform, from sweating and overcrowding at home to the treatment of aborigines in Australia and West Africa and elsewhere; while in such matters as temperance and education it goes without saying that the Bishops are expected to be the mouthpiece of many thousands of people outside.<lb/>
My Lords, I am satisfied as to the usefulness of that function, but I believe that its usefulness is enhanced, and that the weight attached to what is said from these Benches is augmented by the fact that, speaking generally, the Bishops have, in recent years at least, held themselves free from the ties of what is ordinarily known as Party allegiance. I am very far from denying that questions of a distinctly political character may arise, and do arise, in the treatment of which all the Bishops
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0477"/>
<col>941</col>
may rightly and properly and consistently take full part, and, I think, it would be affectation to pretend that we are, not as citizens quite as well qualified as the average members of this House to form and express opinions on those questions. But I believe that, ordinarily speaking, at any rate, the Bishops act wisely in, as I have said, sitting loose to Party ties. This particular occasion, in which, so far as I can judge from some of the speeches we have listened to, it seems to be clearly decided that the Division is to have a strictly Party character, is, in my judgment and in the judgment of many Bishops who have spoken or written to me on the subject, one of the occasions on which we are right in standing aside. I will not hesitate to say that I personally&#x2014;and here I speak for myself alone&#x2014;regret that the Division is to have that character. But apparently, so it is. The direct issue is the question whether or not the money which is required for the expenditure&#x2014;the increasing expenditure&#x2014;of the country can or cannot be rightly raised in a particular way without a further appeal to the constituencies. The other grave issues, which are not obscurely involved, are indirect issues or consequences, after all.<lb/>
My Lords, some Bishops are, and have always been, honourably associated with political ties on one side or the other. Your Lordships have heard speeches this week from some who might be so described; although I should be very far from saying that their speeches were of a purely political kind, and you may perhaps hear more. There is nothing more natural and right than that votes should be given in correspondence with such speeches. Again, nobody will imagine for a moment, that those Bishops who agree with me as to what is this week our duty in circumstances of peculiar difficulty desire even to criticise those Bishops who think otherwise. The reference which I have just made to social questions, and if anybody cares to look at them, the records of my own words and votes, such as they are, in this House will, I think, afford clear evidence that it is not because I and those who think with me are indifferent to the great social questions which are astir in England in connection with the life of the poor that we are taking the line we do take. I have tried to show that what we are doing we are doing deliberately, in the genuine belief that by adhering to an independent standpoint
<col>942</col>
we increase our power of contributing usefully to the solution of some of the greatest, deepest and most urgent problems which Parliament has continuously to consider and to decide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03449"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I earnestly wish that the most rev. Primate, to whose weighty words we have just listened with so much attention, would throw the &#x00E6;gis of his doctrine of silence over myself, who am quite as dissociated from Party as any Prelate that sits upon the Bench behind him and perhaps more, I think, than some. I wish it because I never rose to address your Lordships with more reluctance than on the present occasion&#x2014;partly from my sense of the awful gravity of the situation, by far the gravest that has occurred in my lifetime or in the lifetime of any man who has been born since 1832; partly from a sense of the personal difficulties that I feel in dealing with this question.<lb/>
My Lords, my difficulties are two-fold. They are personal to myself and they are also difficulties connected with the line of policy which is proposed to be adopted by those behind me. Let me get rid of my personal difficulties at once, because a personal topic is apt to be less interesting to the audience than to the speaker himself. I have given utterance to opinions about this House, and more especially in regard to its relations to financial legislation, and have given them in the highest office that a subject can occupy under the Crown, which in my opinion prevent me from giving a vote to the noble Marquess, or even from giving an opinion favourable to the policy which is urged by those on the Bench behind me.<lb/>
It is quite true that I attach not much weight to individual opinion. It is also true that I have observed that Ministers sitting on that Bench, when they are anxious to get a measure through this House, are apt to take a higher view of the privileges of the House of Commons with regard to finance&#x2014;and I say this of both sides of the House, because we have the utterances of the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, in our minds, and also, I think, the utterances of the late Marquess of Salisbury, whose son we have heard with so much pleasure and acceptance to-night&#x2014;that Ministers are apt when they are anxious to press a Bill through
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0478"/>
<col>943</col>
this House, to rate the privileges of the House of Commons much higher than they are apt to do in the cooler moments of Opposition. But I do think it is due both to that political honour and consistency which every man must try to preserve by his own standard and in his own way, and also more especially due to the great office which I filled when I uttered those opinions, that I should not do anything in contravention of them to-night.<lb/>
My Lords, I have heard with great interest the subject argued from both sides of the House. I have heard the authoritative pronouncement of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, delivered with so much clearness and ability on the first night of our debate, though it may, to some extent, be, not neutralised, but qualified by the quotation from his speech of last year to which we have just listened. While I think it is clear that the letter of the law is certain, that by the letter of the law it is competent to this House to reject a Finance Bill&#x2014;I do not think that is questioned by any authority&#x2014;while it is within the competence of the House, if it thinks fit, to reject a Finance Bill, I understand that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack draws a distinction, not merely one of expediency, which is obvious to us all, but also one between what he calls the law and the Constitution, by which, if I rightly comprehend him, I understand he means the letter of the Constitution and the practice, so to speak the common law of the Constitution under which this Constitution is carried on.<lb/>
We hear a great deal&#x2014;this is the first of my marginal notes&#x2014;about the immemorial practice of centuries in allowing Financial Bills to pass through this House unopposed. It is not quite unbroken, but it is practically the practice of centuries. I have one historical observation to offer on that practice, and it is this&#x2014;that it is only really valid after the year 1832, because up to that year the House of Lords had in practice the control of the House of Commons, both for themselves and the classes with which they were associated, and it was not, therefore, either probable or even possible that the House of Commons should send up a Budget Bill to this House which it would be inclined to take the extreme measure of rejecting. And if we take the precedent of 1832 and take the period since, we certainly have one grave precedent in the year 1860 or 1861 which shows that the practice has not been quite
<col>944</col>
unbroken. I therefore say that there are arguments on the other side with regard to the practice of the Constitution which should not be lost sight of in this discussion.<lb/>
My Lords, I quite admit that the Budget of 1894, for which I was Ministerially responsible, though it was highly objectionable to the House of Lords, was allowed to pass through, not without discussion, but I think without anything like a Division. But I have always suspected that the House of Lords in dealing in that way with the Budget, had not obscurely in view the somewhat precarious position of the Government, and thought that even if they allowed it to pass through they would recover in a very short time by a General Election the authority to deal with financial affairs as best might seem to themselves. Then I think there is this further remark to be made&#x2014;that to abnormal measures abnormal methods of defence may be offered. Take, for example, an instance in which a Finance Bill might, if the House of Lords thought fit, be dealt with, perhaps even summarily. I take the case of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, who spoke last night and with so much ability worthy of his historic name. He expressed himself in no dubious terms in regard to our military and naval expenditure. Suppose the noble Earl, in the official position so long occupied by his grandfather as head of the Government, were to bring in a Budget or to authorise one to be brought in (because I fear in his circumstances he can never bring in a Budget himself) which lowered&#x2014;in the tone of his speech last night&#x2014;the defences of the country in a way in which the nation at large thought dangerous. On such an occasion I cannot but think that the House of Lords might be justified, supported by the authority of the nation, in rejecting such a financial Bill as that. That is the illustration I give of the possible exceptional measure which might demand a departure from the ordinary orthodox practice.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, there is another point which I think has to be noticed in regard to the practice and not the letter of the Constitution. We are guided by maxims and unwritten axioms with regard to what is called the Constitution. There is one maxim so undoubted that we have learned&#x2014;it has been burned into us by bitter experience&#x2014;I mean the maxim that there is no taxation without representation in this country. The disregard of that maxim lost us the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0479"/>
<col>945</col>
United States, and we are not likely knowingly to offend against it again. What is the case with regard to the actual practice of that principle, that undoubted principle, of the English Constitution? Your Lordships are accused by your enemies of owning some enormous proportion of the land of England at this moment. Some put it at one-fifth, some at one-third, and I dare say, in the excitement of the election, as things grow warmer, you will be accused of owning the whole. But whatever your proportion may be, if it is anything like so high as it is put by persons outside opposed to your House, I think it is eminently to be regretted that so large a portion of the land, if it be large, should be held in so few hands.<lb/>
But what have we to say about no taxation without representation. This one-fifth, one-third, or this entirety if you like, of the land of England held by the unfortunate people who sit in this House is to be taxed freely, abundantly, and increasingly without its having a word or a vote. I do not support those arguments myself. I am a man of peace and I have given too many hostages to fortune in regard to the position and attributes of this House to be able to unsay them on this occasion. But in listening to this discussion I have been forced to offer some qualifying reflections in regard to the extreme doctrines of the Government, to put some water, if I may so express myself, to the extremely strong Constitutional wine that we have been invited to drink. But, my Lords, however you may judge the position of the House, there is one supreme, indispensable condition of the exercise of any dormant power that it has been claimed to possess, and that is that it should only be exercised under exceptional circumstances by, so far as is known, the direct authority and with the express condonation of the nation itself. That is a doctrine which if I live to be a hundred I shall adhere to, I feel confident, with much more security and certainty than I can to some of those more official doctrines which I uttered when I sat on the Bench opposite.<lb/>
I quite agree&#x2014;and that is one of the public considerations which make me unable to vote for the Amendment of the noble Marquess&#x2014;that the Budget is vital. I quite agree that the Budget threatens to poison the very sources of our national supremacy. I have said abundantly all that I think on that point, and I am not going to repeat it to-day. But there is something
<col>946</col>
which in my mind, in view of the immediate future, in view even of the remote future, is more vital to this country than the Budget itself, and that is the strength, efficiency, and security of the Second Chamber. With regard to the Budget, I do not want to deal again with that rather hackneyed subject. Having occupied the attention of an intelligent audience with it in an atmosphere in which the thermometer marked seventy-five degrees, I am not likely to be anxious to return to it now.<lb/>
Although I uttered many words on that occasion, I can conscientiously say that the days which have passed over me since then have not weakened in my mind one single syllable, or made me think of reversing or recalling one single syllable, of what I uttered on that occasion. Every day that has passed over my head since then has rather increased than diminished my sense of the danger of the measure which it is proposed Parliament should adopt. There are one or two things in passing that I wish to say with regard to it. I did not say them formerly; I may say them now. This Budget has the unpleasant aspect of being both crude and vindictive. I do not say that it is crude or vindictive; far be it from me to say anything of that kind, knowing that I shall be contradicted on the highest authority and told that it is neither the one nor the other. I say it appears to the naked eye of the casual observer to be both crude and vindictive.<lb/>
If it be not crude&#x2014;though we are told that no Budget has received one tithe of the attention which this Budget has&#x2014;how are we to explain the frequent reversals of position, the standing first on one leg and then on the other, and finally on none, which has characterised the proceedings on this most ill-omened measure? If it be not crude, how are we to account for the 250 Amendments which the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself thought it right to put down even on the Report stage? I would not say it is crude, but I will say this, to use a Tariff Reform metaphor which will appeal to both sides of this House, that never in the memory of man, in all the onerous proceedings which are charged against the great overproducing countries, has such a mass of raw material been dumped down in this country at any one time as when the Budget was introduced.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0480"/>
<col>947</col>
I know it is only to the outward eye that it is vindictive. I must say my noble friend Lord Salisbury to-night brought forward some reasons and some quotations, which made one think that even to a less passing eye than that of the casual observer it might seem to bear that character. Some might think that one part of it was directed against a considerable commercial interest, and a great many might think that the whole of it was more or less designed as a battering-ram against the doors of this House. But, acknowledging that it be not vindictive, I must be allowed to say that in the consideration of the measure by the Cabinet there must have been going on a great deal of what psychologists call unconscious cerebration when that measure was brought forward. That is not all that is to be said even at this juncture about the Budget.<lb/>
The Budget has already done incalculable mischief. That cannot be denied except by some of the more Pretorian and devoted supporters of His Majesty's Government. It has already destroyed confidence in a remarkable degree. This country was not long ago the strong-box and the safe of Europe, to which every man outside this country sent his savings that they might be secure. That was an enormous mass of capital which was sent to England for security. I venture to ask&#x2014;I see two great financial authorities near me&#x2014;whether those millions have not already disappeared from this country? Those have been wantonly cast away. What is following? Many millions from the people of this country as well. I believe that all the great ships that go westward across the Atlantic are at this moment carrying bonds and stocks in ballast in order that they may be got away from the jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government. This want of confidence is not merely confined to the reserves of money; it has also extended to every form of enterprise. No one is able to embark in any commercial undertaking for fear of the Government coming down and taking the proceeds without sharing the losses. I think we may say, to quote a well-known speech on a famous occasion, that we find every avenue of commercial enterprise blocked up because the Chancellor of the Exchequer stops the way. My Lords, the honest truth is that already your measure has spread over the country, like one great pervading miasma or fog, the disease of want of confidence
<col>948</col>
and want of credit, the most fatal disease which perhaps can affect a commercial nation like ours. We had abundant evidence of that kind in the able and authoritative speech of Lord Revelstoke the other night, to which I listened with so much pleasure; and we had from my noble friend Lord Lansdowne an additional proof which struck me as almost more remarkable than anything said by the head of the house of Baring. It was with regard to the British issues during the first ten months of this year. He showed, if I remember his figures aright, that they had sunk from fifty-five millions in 1908 to twenty millions for a similar period in 1909. Can there be conceived a more disastrous proof of the immediate and ruinous effect of the Budget on all commercial transactions than such a fact, and an undoubted fact, as that?<lb/>
I was not at all comforted by the consolation administered in the oracular speech of the Secretary for Scotland delivered last night. He told us that the cause was clear&#x2014;that there was undoubtedly a difference of thirty-five millions between the issues of last year and the issues of this year, but the reason was obvious. The thirty-five millions difference had all gone into private enterprise; although he was unable to cite any figures in support of his contention, and I think he would find it extremely difficult to do so. He found solace for himself, but I am sorry to say he completely failed in imparting it to me. I do not know what the pundits of the City thought when they read that explanation of this deficiency, but sure I am of this&#x2014;that among the many reasons we have for congratulating ourselves on the accession of the noble Lord to this House there is one new one after last night, which is that under no circumstances can he ever be Chancellor of the Exchequer.<lb/>
There is one extraordinary delusion which seems to underlie the arguments of the supporters of the Budget. It is that capital is a luxury and nothing but a luxury. You spend it on motor cars or "anything," I think one speaker said; I do not know what "anything" meant. They do not seem to understand that it is a base of prime necessity of this country either for peace or for war. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, gave us a poetical description of the Temple of Mammon, by which name he designated the City of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0481"/>
<col>949</col>
London; and I think he was a little ungrateful, if I may say so, to the City of London, which formerly gave such unflinching support to Lord John Russell in times of good and times of evil. He said the Temple of Mammon narrowed the mental horizon of those who worshipped in it. If in speaking of the Temple of Mammon he alluded to the fact that up to this time this country has been the great mart for the capital of the world, that it has been an enormous strength to it in peace and a security during war, that it has owed more to capital than to anything except the character and labour of the people&#x2014;if he had appreciated these facts, I think he would have used expressions somewhat more mild with regard to that apparently noxious element in our national life. When I hear the noble Earl speak about the Temple of Mammon I cannot help thinking of the Temple of Janus, and let me assure the noble Earl that whether the doors of the Temple of Janus be open or shut, capital is equally indispensable to the welfare of this country. On one point I do offer him my humble agreement. I do think that, under the pressure of the great armaments which are eating out the heart of Europe, Europe is hurrying headlong to bankruptcy. I do believe it. I do think that, perhaps not in my time, but in the time of those who are yet young, we shall see bankruptcy produced by the insane competition of armaments winch is now eating out the hearts of the people. But that is only a digression. I come back to the immediate subject of the Amendment of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
My Lords, I am, as I have amply proved, hostile to the Budget. I cannot, I think, be more hostile to the Budget than I am, but I am not willing to link the fortunes of the Second Chamber with opposition to the Budget. I find no fault with the Resolution of the noble Marquess, if he thought it right to have a Resolution at all, and I do not suppose that he had much choice in the matter. No doubt the impetus of his own forces carried him forward whether he wished it or not, and of course it may be fair to argue, as has been argued, that it is not a Resolution for the rejection of the Bill, but a method for bringing about an appeal to the people for their assent or negative to the Budget. There is nothing I should rejoice at so much as any reference of that kind if there were any constitutional means of obtaining it without mixing it
<col>950</col>
up with other issues foreign to it, and which may greatly impair the directness and validity of the decision. If, for example, you had the Referendum in this country&#x2014;and I for my part believe that you will never arrive at a final solution of the question of the adjustment of differences between the two Houses without some form of Referendum&#x2014;I would gladly vote that it should be applied on this occasion.<lb/>
But you have no referendum when you go to a General Election. General Elections, whatever else their merits may be, are not conducted in a Palace of Truth. Have you any hope&#x2014;for I confess that my hope is slender&#x2014;that a distinction between your motion and a motion for indiscriminate rejection will be considered with cool impartiality by the people of this country. My Lords, you know very well that there is a considerable body of public opinion which is extremely hostile to the existence and to the attributes of this House. We must all be aware&#x2014;and if we are not aware of it then we neither listen to nor read what is said and written&#x2014;that the hereditary constitution of this House does lend itself to effective, even if it be unjust, satire and criticism when the merits of this House come to be discussed by the electorate. If you had thought it well in the time when it was open&#x2014;and I hope it will be soon open again&#x2014;to reform this House, then you would have been able possibly to bear the strain to be put on its vitality now. But I honestly confess&#x2014;and I think your Lordships will allow me to say that I have been tolerably consistent in urging that reform in and out of season&#x2014;that I do apprehend the result of an appeal to the country on an unreformed hereditary Second Chamber, mixed up with the promises of the Budget. I doubt whether you are choosing the best battlefield on which to risk the attributes and perhaps the existence of this House.<lb/>
Let me make one practical suggestion. It is seldom in a debate of this kind that a practical suggestion is made. Is the mention of a practical suggestion languidly cheered by some noble Lord opposite an augury of his opinion that a practical suggestion is so badly needed because of this most impracticable Budget? The noble Marquess is a lord of many legions in this House. He can carry his Resolution by a majority which I do not like to compute,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0482"/>
<col>951</col>
but which will compare favourably with some of the Government majorities in the other House. I believe that the first basis of any reform of your Lordships' House will be some form of delegation such as is practised by the Scottish and Irish Peerage, or else some such reform as that which is indicated in the Report of your Lordships' Committee giving persons of certain qualifications alone the right to vote from among the Peers, and we found that there is an unexpectedly large number of them. Is it too late to ask the majority of this House to adopt in the coming Division some such reform as that, to take only the Peers who have those qualifications, or to delegate the duty to those whom they think well fitted to act as their champions on this occasion? There are some who will swell the majority&#x2014;and I make the remark without the slightest wish to convey disrespect&#x2014;who will not count for a great deal when their names are called over, for reasons which I do not think are uncomplimentary to themselves, if they will allow me to say so. Some of us are very young; I wish we all were. Some of us have not, from circumstances or taste, taken any part in public life. Their names will not greatly count in a Division; but if you chose to select 150 Peers from this majority and depute to them the right of voting for your Resolution, then you will produce a list of names quite as weighty in their collective number as any similar list of names that could be collected from the House of Commons, and which would carry a far greater weight with the country when it was reckoned up and estimated than the mere numerical force which you will be able to bring into the Lobby to-morrow night. I do not suppose my suggestion is likely to be adopted, but I do think that a self-denying ordinance would not be a bad thing, and I am as certain as I am of standing here that in the country such a list would have infinitely more weight than 400 or 500 names taken without any selection at all.<lb/>
My Lords, I think you are playing for too heavy a stake on this occasion. I think that you are risking in your opposition to what I agree with you in thinking is an iniquitous and dangerous measure, the very existence of a Second Chamber. I do not pretend to be very greatly alarmed at the menaces which have been addressed to us on this and on other occasions. The House of Lords has lived on menaces ever
<col>952</col>
since I can recollect, and yet it seems to be in a tolerably thriving condition still. But I ask you to remember this. The menaces which were addressed to this House in old days were addressed by Statesmen who had at heart the balance of the constitutional forces in this country. The menaces addressed to you now come from a wholly different school of opinion, who wish for a single Chamber and who set no value on the controlling and revising forces of a Second Chamber&#x2014;a school of opinion which, if you like it and do not dread the word, is eminently revolutionary in essence, if not in fact. I ask you to bear in mind that fact when you weigh the consequences of the vote which you are to give to-morrow night. "Hang consequences," said my noble friend Lord Camperdown last night, "let them take care of themselves." That is a noble utterance&#x2014;a Balaklava utterance. Nothing more intrepid could be said. But the truest courage in these matters weighs the consequences, not to the individual, but to the State, and thinks not once, but twice or thrice before it gives a vote which may involve such enormous constitutional consequences. I have often heard it said by many friends, "What is the use of the House of Lords if it cannot always vote according to its convictions?" My reply to that is that the House of Lords exercises enormous power without always voting on its convictions, and the power that it exercises was never so valuable or so much wanted as now.<lb/>
The whole system of modern legislation is conducted on a principle now which makes the House of Lords absolutely invaluable to the Constitution of this country. The old idea as to Bills entertained by Mr. Gladstone and Statesmen of his stamp was to mature one or two great measures, not as this Budget has been matured, but in a very different oven, with the greatest care and circumspection, to concentrate their attention and forces upon them, and to send them up to this House in as perfect a condition as possible. Now the one idea is to produce as great an output of Bills as can be possibly produced by the overtasked Departments of the Crown, to get them through the House of Commons with as little discussion and as little inquiry as possible, and to shoot them into this Chamber like rubbish on a dustheap. My Lords, I venture to say that in the immature condition of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0483"/>
<col>953</col>
legislation of the House of Commons you ought to watch very carefully and reserve very carefully the power that remains with you of revision and correction.<lb/>
There is a question very near and dear to many of your Lordships as to which you have been able to effect in past times what has been welcomed by a large section of the people of this country. You have been able to resist the establishment of a Parliament in Dublin. I ask you to consider what will happen if you weaken your power of resistance by any unwise policy which you may adopt, or by any rash measures you may adopt, to that particular policy. Mr. Redmond the other day said&#x2014;and his authority on such a point no one I can question&#x2014;that the last remaining obstacle to Home Rule, the only remaining barrier to the establishment of Home Rule, is the House of Lords. Are you going to weaken that barrier? Are you going to risk that power of resistance, on a conflict with the House of Commons which will be represented on 10,000 platforms as a conflict with the people? Are you going to weaken that power of resistance by voting for the Resolution of my noble friend?<lb/>
My Lords, there is one further consideration which I will venture to urge upon you. It is a practical one, and for that reason it has quite as much weight with me as any of those which I have adduced. Remember, that in hanging up or in rejecting the Budget the House of Lords is doing exactly what its enemies wish it to do. Now, I believe that in life it is a pretty safe maxim to ascertain what it is your enemy wishes you to do, and to do something very much unlike it. I confess I have no doubt, when I read the speeches delivered in various parts of the country, speeches unusual and unprecedented in my time as regards speeches by Cabinet Ministers, that they are meant to stir up and incite the House of Lords to do exactly the thing which the House of Lords meditates doing.<lb/>
I confess that policy does not appeal to me. I should like a less heroic policy, which I think would have answered much better the majority of this House, but which I fear it is too late to ask the House to adopt, although I believe it to be the winning policy for those who are opposed to the Budget. I should have liked to see the
<col>954</col>
House of Lords pass this Finance Bill, not because I have a good opinion of it but because I have such an excessively bad opinion of it. I have such confidence in its demerits, when this Finance Bill is in action, that I should wish it to be judged by its performance after six or eight months of experience, and not by its promise as it will be held out at the polls. I believe that if you chose to allow the Budget Bill to take effect, and when the country had had a sufficient experience of its intolerable inquisitions, its intolerable bureaucracy, and, above all, the enormous loss of employment and capital which it must involve&#x2014;a loss of employment which, I think, the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack realised in his speech&#x2014;and which must add enormously to the hideousness of the problem which the Budget will do nothing to solve&#x2014;the problem of unemployment in this country: I believe that if you gave the country an experience of the Budget in operation you would achieve a victory when you next approach the polls which would surprise yourselves and would give you the power of revising the finance of this country by methods more in consonance with your own principles and your own commonsense. We should then have an anti-Socialist Government, a luxury which I cannot say we possess now. We should have a reformed Second Chamber, in the way not merely of purging it to some extent, and arriving at the choicest part of it by delegation and election, but also by renovating it by means of those external elements that must necessarily give strength to a Second Chamber&#x2014;all that would have been achieved in the best and, in the non-Party sense, the most conservative interests of this United Kingdom. Unfortunately, that is not the line that the House is going to take. I am sorry&#x2014;with all my heart I am sorry&#x2014;that I cannot give a vote against the Budget on this occasion. My interest in this matter is mainly that of the Second Chamber, and I cannot stake all my hopes of its future utility and reform on the precarious and tumultuous chances, involved as they will be with many other irrelevant and scarcely honest issues&#x2014;the tumultuous hazards of a General Election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03450"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the speech of the noble Earl who has just sat down has had the effect upon noble Lords opposite of cold water being thrown down
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0484"/>
<col>955</col>
their backs, or not. Noble Lords opposite made complaint on the first night of this debate that the Lord Chancellor in the advice which he gave your Lordships had been guilty of something in the way of threats. That was how noble Lords opposite were pleased to interpret his words; but it has been said by the noble Earl who has just sat down, speaking not by way of threat, but by way of kindness, that the composition of your Lordships' House is open to criticism. He said that if it had been reformed it might have stood the strain of the present constitutional issue. Then he told your Lordships that you had not chosen the best battlefield; and he went on to tell you very politely that though there are a great number of Peers who are going to vote in favour of the Motion and against the Budget, and although I thought at one time that he was going to congratulate your Lordships that you were going to get as large a majority here as the Government got in the other House, he then went on to say that as a matter of fact, a great number of those Peers did not count, and that the noble Lords ought to strengthen their position by choosing 150 of their number to represent them. Well, my Lords, I think that was very unkind of the noble Earl. Then he went on to say that your Lordships were risking too heavy a stake, that you were risking the very existence of the Second Chamber, and that your Lordships' House wanted to be overhauled and reconstructed. It sounded like a spring cleaning.<lb/>
But, my Lords, what reasons does the noble Earl give for his hostility to the Budget? He says that the Budget is very dangerous; that it is very crude; and that it is very vindictive. I should like to remind the House that this Budget has been under discussion in the House of Commons for six months. It has been under discussion longer than any Bill I can recollect in my lifetime, and I was for a great many years in the House of Commons. The noble Earl, however, said that the Bill was very crude and very vindictive, but what did he give as an illustration of its crudeness? He said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself on the Report Stage brought up 250 Amendments. The noble Earl never was in the House of Commons, for if he had been, he would have known what that meant. When a big Bill is under discussion in Committee, all sorts of people, mostly the Opposition,
<col>956</col>
move Amendments and the Government accept those Amendments in principle, although as a rule they are not well drafted and will not fit into the Bill as it stands; and so the Minister in charge of the Bill says that he will re-draft it, himself incorporating their Amendments as his own and bringing them up on Report Stage. That is what happened with regard to this Bill, and so far from the Amendments being a sign of crudeness and rawness, they were very largely Amendments moved by members I of the Opposition and incorporated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as his own Amendments, in order to meet the views of the Opposition.<lb/>
The noble Earl went on to say that this Budget has already done incalculable damage. He said that commercial enterprise was stopped, and that there was a great loss of credit, all due to the Budget. I should admit at once that there are people in this country who are afraid of the Budget. Can you wonder at it? [Cries of "No."] No&#x0021; Because most of you have not read the Budget. But can you wonder at it when you read a speech like that of the noble Earl. He is not one of the irresponsible Members who ought not to be allowed to vote in this House; yet here is a noble Earl who holds a high voice in the country, who has been the highest servant of the Crown, making the statements that he has made in this House What does he do to encourage confidence and to encourage credit? He says millions have gone abroad, that the foreign millions are gone, and that the home millions are going. Everything has gone abroad, and he says that ships to North America are leaving our shores ballasted with bonds and stocks and shares as cargo. My Lords, that is what is said by an ex-Prime Minister of England&#x0021; People will read that statement to-morrow, and although we know very well that the noble Earl is merely jesting, there are thousands of people in the country who do not know who will read that statement in the newspapers to-morrow morning, and who do not know that he is only jesting. We are all aware that the noble Earl is very fond of coming to your Lordships' House and making speeches on all sides, but after all what is play to the noble Earl may mean death to other people. There are many people who may read what the noble Earl says and who may get frightened and sell out their stocks at a loss. Many people who
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0485"/>
<col>957</col>
read that sort of thing will lose by it, and of all the Party opposite, there is not a single member of this House who will be more responsible for it than the noble Earl himself.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has just sat down talked of unemployment. He said that the Budget was going to cause great unemployment, and that if noble Lords would only let it pass, it would cause so much more unemployment that some day or other noble Lords would get a majority in the other House of their own way of thinking. Why cannot the noble Earl give us some statistics for that statement? There has been a good deal of talk of unemployment in this House, but after all these are the statistics. Last September, in the great staple trades of this country as returned by the Trade Unions, the amount of unemployment was 7&#x00B7;4. We all know when winter comes on that unemployment is apt to increase in this country, but this year it did not. In October unemployment went down from 7&#x00B7;4 to 7&#x00B7;1. If you compare the state of things before the Budget with the state of things after the Budget, it works out thus: In October this year, after the Budget, the figure for unemployment was 7&#x00B7;1, whereas in October last year before the Budget it was 9&#x00B7;5. Let that be a little check on some noble Lords who have no personal experience in the matter, and who having no personal experience might at least be content to go to the official statistics.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I want to say a few words on the subject of capital going abroad, because that is a subject with which I have some personal practical acquaintance. There has been a great deal of talk of capital leaving the country. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Revelstoke, spoke of that the other night in his speech here. I am sorry I was unavoidably prevented from being here to listen to it. However, I read it carefully in the paper from end to end, and the noble Lord, to take his last point first&#x2014;and I was very much struck with one remark that he made&#x2014;said that all sorts of people came to him in the City and asked him his financial opinion as to what to buy, and that they always said to him "We do not want your opinion of anything at home; we want something good to buy abroad." Why do they, my Lords? The reason is perfectly obvious. I have no doubt that the noble Lord has
<col>958</col>
great general knowledge of all investments both at home and abroad. On many things he is a great specialist; he is a great specialist of Foreign Government and Foreign Municipal Bonds, and if I had the happiness of being in the position of having to ask the advice of the noble Lord myself, I should not go to him to ask his opinion with regard to home affairs, of which he only knows as much as other people. I should ask him his opinion with regard to good foreign investments, in which he is a specialist. Naturally, people who are seeking advice go to the man who is best able to give them advice on a particular subject. The noble Lord was careful to distinguish between the words "Capital drawn abroad" and "Capital driven abroad," and he was right to make that distinction. But if he says, of his own knowledge, that capital has been frightened abroad because of the Budget, I should, of course, accept his statement; but it is, I think, quite possible that if his statement is made generally&#x2014;when we know that people in the responsible position of an ex-Prime Minister of England have been talking nonsense about bonds being shipped from these shores as ballast&#x2014;I do not wonder that there are many people who attach importance to these statements and naturally are frightened. And I venture to say to your Lordships, that if these statements had not been made, after three months experience of the administration of the Budget any bonds that had been shipped away from this country by way of ballast would be shipped back again within three months. Now, I venture to ask your Lordships what is the difference between capital drawn abroad and capital driven abroad?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03451"><member>LORD REVELSTOKE</member><membercontribution>: "Attracted" was the word I used.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03452"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member><membercontribution>: I accept the correction. Capital attracted abroad, as I say, will no doubt come back again. But I want to go into this question of capital being driven abroad, because a good many people have been talking about capital invested abroad as if it was a terrible national disaster. There was a very interesting article&#x2014;I do not want to inflict it upon your Lordships now&#x2014;published a month or two ago in the <i>Journal of the Statistical Society</i>. It was a paper read by Mr. Paish, and there was a long discussion upon it. There was one thing on which all the speakers were agreed, which was, that every period of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0486"/>
<col>959</col>
a great export of national capital had been followed by a period of good trade. The statistics they worked out, I should imagine, were very difficult to arrive at; but they agreed that the figures were authoritative and more or less accurate. They said that in the seven years 1884 to 1890 British capital invested abroad&#x2014;the noble Lord, I have no doubt, will call that attracted abroad&#x2014;amounted to the sum of 400 millions, and that that was followed by a period of good trade. Then there were seven years in which very little capital went abroad&#x2014;those seven years included the South African war, when there was great national extravagance in this country, and when money that might have been allowed to accumulate for investment was fired away in powder and shot&#x2014;not a very profitable way of investing money as a rule. In those years only 100 millions were invested abroad. Then from the year 1904&#x2014;your Lordships will particularly note the year 1904, because the Tory Government were in office in that year&#x2014;capital had been saved up again, and there was capital to go abroad&#x2014;in the four and a-half years since 1904 we have actually invested abroad 400 millions, and a good deal of it has been invested abroad during the time the Conservative Government were in office. Has the loss of that capital injured this country? Is it a thing to deplore, or is it a thing to rejoice at?<lb/>
I noticed the other day that the Prime Minister in a speech he made said that capital being invested abroad was a fine thing for the trade of this country. When you talk, as the noble Lord opposite did, of capital being driven abroad and attracted abroad&#x2014;I put this to your Lordships as business men&#x2014;what does it matter whether it goes abroad because it is attracted or because it is driven as long as you have ample capital left in this country. I believe one of the greatest authorities in the world on capital going abroad, Lord Rothschild, will speak to-night, and I must say I am looking forward very much to hearing what he has to say on that point. I do not see him in the House at present, but I should like to hear his answer to this question whether there is any scarcity of capital in this country for any sound and decently remunerative investment? My Lords, I shall be surprised to hear that question answered in the affirmative, for my own experience is distinctly the reverse, although I would not for one moment attempt to set up my experience on such a point against
<col>960</col>
the experience of two of the greatest authorities in the world. I would, however, ask them this question: will they get up and say, of their own experience, that they do know to-day of thoroughly sound concerns in Great Britain where large sums of money might be invested with advantage for security's sake at a decent rate of interest; are they aware of any sound concern in this country that is wanting capital and cannot get it? I can only say that no such cases have come my way, and I believe that for any sound concern showing a chance of profit, that capital would be found for it at home and found a great deal easier than money for investment abroad. With regard to the investment of capital in this country, people sometimes talk as if there was no limit to the scope or to the amount of money that can be invested in this country and invested to advantage; but, my Lords, you must consider the difference between old countries and new countries. Our land here is not a pampas with a few people scattered about it and none of the amenities of civilisation. We have got here in existence already practically all the great undertakings for which capital can be used with advantage. What do you want capital for? You want capital for the construction of railways, tramways, waterworks, electric light undertakings, docks and harbours and great industrial works of that sort. My Lords, this country has got all those. It is supplied with them in every place where there is population enough to make them pay, and it is supplied with them very often in places which are too small for them to pay. In other words this country has got the great bulk of the capital it needs employed in order that the existing inhabitants of the country may make their living.<lb/>
How can you use fresh capital in this country to advantage? I hope your Lordships will bear with me because this is a point which has been dealt with very frequently in the course of the debate. Fresh capital can only be used to advantage, first of all, when there is a great increase of population; and, secondly, when you get some new want invented. The population of this country increases at the rate of about 300,000 a year. Of course, if you were to take an agricultural field and to plant those 300,000 people down upon it you might be able to reckon after a short time what amount of capital they would require for their needs. They would want a bit of railway; they would want tramways;
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0487"/>
<col>961</col>
they would want industries; and capital would be requited to establish shops and stores and factories of all kinds. I do not know how much they would want&#x2014;it might be as much as &#x00A3;20,000,000 or &#x00A3;30,000,000&#x2014;but that is not the way in which the people of this country require their large amounts of capital. The population of a country does not increase all in one place. There may be an increase of 1,000 in one of the bigger cities, 500 in another, and 100 in some little town somewhere else. The increment of the population is spread about, all over the country and the capital is subscribed little by little and mainly by private people. I saw a speech of Mr. George Wyndham's on this subject some time ago in which he gave something which he called statistics. No one, I think, has been able to find out where he got them, but he worked out that, over a certain period, out of &#x00A3;16,000,000 invested in Great Britain only &#x00A3;2,000,000 were invested in industrial concerns. My Lords, I do think we ought to be a little, shy of statistics by Mr. George Wyndham when we remember that we have recently been bothered in this House for some time by the Irish Land Bill owing to the fact that Mr. George Wyndham cannot do a sum. Every figure he had in his Bill was wrong.<lb/>
When your Lordships remember that the increase of the population is spread about over a very wide field you must agree that the capital required for that increased population is spread about over a very wide field also. If a town, for example, increases by 1,000 people it simply means that the shopkeepers in the place&#x2014;the boot-makers, the tailors, the grocers, and so on&#x2014;have all added a new wing to their shops and extended their business and that the necessary capital for that purpose has come in from small private people all over the country. Therefore, my Lords, it is absolutely impossible for anybody living to arrive at any true conclusion as to the amount of capital invested at home by taking the lists of the public issues that come out in the newspapers week by week, because in the case of a foreign concern that wants capital investors in Great Britain know nothing about it and the concern can only get its money by advertising largely and explaining what it is; whereas, if it is a small local concern it can get its money locally from the people who live near by and know all about it. My Lords, there are two ways in which openings are
<col>962</col>
made for the investment of capital at home: one is the increase of population and the other is the starting of a new industry, and there is little doubt that new industries will be started. Some years ago there was the great bicycle industry. That found money readily enough; a great deal too readily for some shareholders. Then more recently there has been the great motor industry. Money was found readily enough for that. Those industries show, as I put it to your Lordships just now, that any concern that offers reasonable prospects of a profitable return in Great Britain can get all the money it requires, and unfortunately because people are so anxious to invest their money in this country rather than abroad a great many concerns get money to the misfortune of the public. It shows that while British investors may through their agents search the world for investments they will never neglect any opportunity of a remunerative chance of investment at their own doors.<lb/>
I want to come now to the investment of money abroad, because we have been told about money being driven abroad and attracted abroad as if that were a misfortune to the country. The money that goes abroad is invested practically in two great directions: in industrial concerns, things like railways and tramways, and also in Government and municipal loans. I can speak myself with regard to industrial concerns abroad and I should very much like if the noble Lord opposite, Lord Rothschild, who is going to speak later, would tell us whether, in his opinion, the money that is lent to foreign Governments and foreign municipalities ruin or increase British trade. His opinion would be immensely interesting on that point, both to your Lordships' House and to the people of the country. I have not enough experience to speak on it myself, and I should like to hear one of the great authorities on it, but I should think that the noble Lord would probably be able to show you that in the case of foreign loans issued in this country, trade followed the loan. If your Lordships will allow me, I should like to give you some facts as to some foreign investments which I have before me and which I have been able absolutely to check myself. When we hear of this country being ruined by capital going abroad, I may say that I asked the secretary of a railway company with which I am connected to take a good large sum of money,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0488"/>
<col>963</col>
a sum large enough to be able to strike an average with regard to, because if he had only taken a million pounds it might have been said that that would not show a very good average. He therefore took a sum of twelve million pounds which had been sent abroad for railways in South America and worked out what had actually happened to it. Roughly, it came to this; and this is what the noble Lord calls money being drawn abroad, and what the noble Earl on the Cross Benches would call the ruin of the country. Thirty-three percent, of it, or four million pounds, went abroad, not in the shape of money but in the shape of materials&#x2014;rails, rolling-stock, engines, wagons and so on&#x2014;every shilling of it being the produce of British labour. Four per cent. of it went in foreign materials. I have not been able to check that exactly, but if I had been able to do so I have no doubt that I should find cases where those foreign materials were not bought from any wish to deal with foreigners, or because the foreigners sold a better article or a cheaper article, but because at the time the English manufacturers were so full of work that we could not buy an engine from them or a wagon sometimes for less than eighteen months ahead.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said the other day that he was in favour of a tariff on foreign articles. Cheapness is not everything. A five per cent. or a ten per cent. increase on goods is not much. But what will happen here? Suppose you have Tariff Reform and put up the price of materials by, say, five per cent. What are we to do? The markets of the world are open to us. We shall have to go abroad and buy a great deal of that which is now bought at home. And we shall have to do that for two reasons; first, because our shareholders will want the concern to pay, and second, a stronger reason still, because the Government of the country where the railways are situated, if they found you buying things dearly in England when we could buy them cheap in other countries, would be down on us and say "If you can afford to fritter our money away in that manner you must reduce your rates." What becomes of the rest of the money? Directly or indirectly, probably indirectly, it has gone abroad in cash. Does that do no good to this country. First of all, the investors do not do badly, for, as a whole, these foreign railways, especially in South
<col>964</col>
American countries, have been a good field for British investors. But there are many other advantages. They employ people here. First, there is the staff of people in the offices, a large staff of people who are very fairly paid. Then you have openings for a great many Englishmen in these other countries. Nearly all the heads of the departments in these foreign concerns are Englishmen, many of them receiving salaries higher, I believe, than some Cabinet Ministers. They are always remitting money home, and wherever they live these men are practically agents for the recommendation of British goods abroad. The last advantage which the investment of this money abroad gives is a great one. All these concerns practically want renewing from time to time. Certainly a railway, every year, to carry on its work and its running, must buy rails and sleepers and engines and wagons and carriages, and all the rest of it, and where do they come to for these things? To this country, and they employ labour here. That money you are sending abroad which the noble Earl considers is a disaster, and which other people think is a thing to deplore&#x2014;that money is what keeps your miners employed in South Wales, it keeps your steel-workers busy, and your engine and wagon builders employed. All those men are kept employed mainly, if not entirely, by this great investment of British capital abroad. Therefore, I think the Prime Minister was more than justified when he said that these great investments abroad were not things to be deplored, but were really the great cause of the building up of British trade in this country.<lb/>
Before I sit down there is just a word or two I should like to say on another subject. The noble Marquess who began the discussion this evening said that the rejection of this Bill is really a democratic proceeding; it is an appeal to the masses of the people by "whose judgment we will abide." I do not know what the result of this election is going to be, and I am the last person to attempt to prophesy; but it would be interesting, suppose there was a Government majority returned as a result of the election, to hear the noble Marquess speaking in this House on the result of that appeal to the people "by whose opinions and whose judgment he will abide." But he left himself a loophole. It is to be "their considered opinion "that he means to abide by. What does
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0489"/>
<col>965</col>
he mean by "their considered opinion?" I suppose he meant if they returned a judgment in favour of this House, that he would accept that as "their considered opinion"; but if they returned a judgment the other way, then that, would not be "their considered opinion," and they must be sent back to think it over for another year. But, at any rate, he said it is a democratic proposal.<lb/>
It has been argued in this House that the rejection of this Budget is just like the rejection of any other Bill; that you can send it to the country; but there is this difference between sending the Budget and any other Bill to the country. You may veto a Licensing Bill; you may veto an Education Bill or any other Bill, but you do not cause a General Election. When you reject a Budget there must be a General Election. I noticed that the Lord Chancellor corrected himself in his speech the other night. He said there must be a General Election, "at least, if the Crown so decides." But you, my Lords, are well aware that the Government of the country cannot be carried on without money. These 160 millions have to be found by somebody, and if you reject the Budget the Crown must decide upon a General Election. I do not want to speak about the constitutional aspect of the question; but what has been up till now the constitutional practice about dissolutions? Dissolutions of the House of Commons have come for two reasons; by the operation of the Septennial Act, or they have come as an act of the Crown. You may gloss over it as you may, slur it over as you will; there is no doubt whatever that if this House rejects this Bill, and the people approve of its action, you have got, from this time on, the right to dissolve Parliament once a year if you like. Once a year you can reject the Budget and send the members of the House of Commons to the country. In other words, you have taken into your hands the prerogative of the Crown.<lb/>
Another thing I observe that noble Lords argue. They say they do not want to choose the taxation of this country; because that is the business of the House of Commons. All they want to do it to veto unjust legislation. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches twice during his speech pointed out that different people could not bring in Budgets. He deplored the fact
<col>966</col>
that Earl Russell should never have an opportunity of bringing in a Budget, but he congratulated himself that the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland could never bring in a Budget. Why could they not? If the rejection of this Budget is carried and approved of by the country, why should any House of Commons waste its time and its health for six months down below there, drawing up Budgets? It is much more simple that the action should take place where the power is. You say you only want to veto the Budget. It is just as if a doctor said to you when you were ill, "I won't choose your food for you. You shall eat what you like; but I will veto some things. You shall not eat flesh, or fowl, or fruit, and various other things." But by this power of veto he could soon get you down to thin soup and water gruel. Would it be exactly the same thing after this, if the country approves this proposed action on the part of your Lordships? Every House of Commons and every Chancellor of the Exchequer will have to get money. They will only waste their time after this in bringing in any legislation you do not like about Budgets. They will know you do not like taxes on liquor. They will know you do not like taxes on land. They will only bring up something they know you will pass. They will tax everybody except the publicans. They will tax everybody except the landlords. And they will be quite right, because the power will be in this House, and the thing will be settled on those Benches opposite. If you are successful in this proposal, you are taking to yourselves the power of taxation. The noble Earl has given you a warning to which I think you would be wise to listen. I do not think anybody on this side of the House or any friend on that side, or any adviser outside will give you such faithful counsel as the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. He more than hinted to you&#x2014;in fact, he told you that you were taking into your hands a job that is too big for you. I do not know whether you will take that warning, and I do not intend to prophesy; but by this proposal of yours to-night, you are taking two things into your hands. With one hand you are grasping at one of the chief prerogatives of the Crown and with the other you are striking down the chief privilege of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03453"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0490"/>
<col>967</col>
addressed us with his usual ability and force, but he has also addressed us with, perhaps, rather more than his usual scorn for those who, like myself, are unfortunate enough to be unable to accept either his facts or his conclusions. I thought he was rather unjust in some of his criticisms of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Revelstoke, but perhaps he ought not to be blamed for that, as he has told us he did not hear that speech. If he had had the good fortune to hear one of the most eloquent speeches delivered in this House for a long time, he might have understood it. As it is, he has addressed a long and eloquent argument to this House to prove what, I will not say no great financial authority, but no quite ordinary man like myself, has ever disputed, and what my noble friend in his speech most emphatically called attention to. He has addressed a long and eloquent argument to us to convince us that it is to the advantage of this country to invest capital abroad. Well, who has ever denied it? That was the point which was brought out perfectly clearly by the noble Lord. It is an advantage to us to invest capital abroad&#x2014;as long as it is not more wanted in this country. The noble Lord has assured us that in his experience there is no such thing at the present time as a profitable British enterprise which has any difficulty in finding capital. I can only say he is extraordinarily fortunate in his experience. Even in my own very limited experience of such matters I have been brought face to face, not with one or two, but with quite a number of cases in recent times in which money was not forthcoming for enterprises in this country where, at ordinary times, I believe it would have been forthcoming.<lb/>
The noble Lord tells us&#x2014;and he is, no doubt, quite right in telling us&#x2014;that we must not judge the total investment of capital in this country merely from the figures of the new issues. He says a great deal of capital is quietly invested, not through the stock market, but by private individuals in private ways. Perfectly true, but it is reasonable to suppose that there is a certain proportion between the capital invested publicly through the stock markets and that privately invested&#x2014;that there is a certain permanent relation between the two; and if, as a matter of fact, we find that the amount of public issues undergoes a great and astonishing and unaccountable reduction, it is a legitimate
<col>968</col>
inference that there is a reduction going on all round in the amount of capital invested. The noble Lord was very merry at the expense of Mr. Wyndham for producing some statistics, for which he said he did not know what possible authority Mr. Wyndham could have. Well, Mr. Wyndham has the reasonably good authority of the <i>Bankers' Magazine</i>. His figure of sixteen millions, with which the noble Lord was not acquainted, is the figure of the English investments&#x2014;that is, of the public issues during the first nine months of the present year&#x2014;and I have given reasons, I think, why we may regard those public issues as a fair indication of the general trend of investment.<lb/>
I should like to call particular attention once more to these figures, because they are very interesting. There has been a gradual tendency to decline for a considerable number of years in the proportion of our public investments in this country as compared with public investments abroad. By public investments I mean investments made through the stock market and not privately; I do not mean investments in the loans of public bodies. I observe that during the years 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, and 1908 the proportion of British investments in this country to the total was respectively forty per cent., thirty-one per cent.&#x2014;that was in 1905&#x2014;now we come to the period of the present Government&#x2014;thirty per cent., twenty-five per cent., and twenty-six per cent; after that we come to this year, with the present Budget, ten per cent. I think we may leave this point as it has been put by the noble Lord who sits behind me, and whose argument remains unshaken in any single particular by the speech to which we have just listened.<lb/>
The subject which we have been discussing for three nights is one so vast, the measure before us is one so comprehensive&#x2014;so many Bills rolled into one&#x2014;and the ulterior issues which depend upon your decision are so grave, that it is impossible for any speaker to deal with more than a very small portion of the case. If I do not refer to-night to many of those arguments of a broad economic and political order which have been adduced in support of the Amendment of the noble Marquess, it is not because I do not agree with them, but I think I should be more considerate for the time of the House if I were to confine
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0491"/>
<col>969</col>
myself to one or two points of which I have special experience.<lb/>
There is one aspect of this measure which has a certain fascination for me, a fascination which most of your Lordships cannot be expected to feel. I am an old tax-gatherer, and in that capacity I feel a sort of professional interest in so huge an engine of taxation. It is fifteen years since I was called upon, in my then capacity of Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, to assist the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the framing of what was considered at the time a very large financial measure&#x2014;I mean what has been known as the Death Duty Budget of Sir William Harcourt. That Budget had been under consideration for more than a year. It was the principal Government measure of the session; it took months to pass it, and it strained to the uttermost the capacities of the leading officials of my then Department. It also greatly taxed the time and energy of the Government draftsmen of that day, Sir Henry Jenkins&#x2014;a man of very great ability, for whose memory I have the deepest respect&#x2014;as well as of the Law Officers of the Crown. Yet, compared with the Finance Bill of the present year, it might be called almost a trivial measure. I remember it was severely criticised at the time for its alleged complexity and unintelligibility. I am afraid that Finance Hills always do appear complex and unintelligible to the layman. But I will venture to say that, whether those criticisms were justified or not, it was a model of simplicity, intelligibility, and coherence as compared with the measure by which we are at present confronted.<lb/>
To say that is not to disparage in any way the ability of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, or of those who have assisted him. I think that ability is manifestly very great. But he has attempted a task which really it was impossible to perform, or at any rate to perform properly in a single year. It was a simple impossibility efficiently to bring about the enactment of all these new and complicated taxes. It may be said that for the immense size and unwieldiness of the present Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself is not to blame; that the multiplicity and severity of these new imposts is simply the necessary result of the great deficit for the year. I think that contention will not hold water for one
<col>970</col>
moment. Sums as large, or very nearly as large, as those raised by taxation in this Budget have been raised within quite recent times in the course of a single year by financial measures less complex, less controversial, and infinitely less meddlesome and harrassing than those contained in the Bill now before us. The difficulties of the Chancellor of the Exchequer were undoubtedly great, but he has gone out of his way to increase them. Is it not an unheard-of thing that a Government which finds itself confronted with the necessity of putting a burden of thirteen or fourteen millions upon the taxpayer in a single year should choose that occasion of all others to introduce a whole bevy of new taxes, not required, and not even available, for the services of the particular year for which it is already bound to provide these huge sums?<lb/>
I may be told that it is necessary to look ahead, and that every Chancellor of the Exchequer has to think a little beyond the present year. Well, I admit that: But if it is necessary to look ahead, what was the justification for throwing away between three and four millions of revenue last year at the very moment when you were committing the country to an additional expenditure of eight millions a year for ever? We hear a great deal in this debate of constitutional precedent. I wonder what is the constitutional precedent for the manner in which the Government have dealt with the business of granting annually aids and supplies to His Majesty. Last year they committed the country to a vast new expenditure for which they refused to provide, while at the same time giving up a very useful source of revenue. This year they are piling up superfluous taxation in order to meet problematical future expenditure. They are putting on taxation for objects which not only have not been approved by, but have never even been submitted to, the House of Commons, much less to the country, and which exist only in the most nebulous form even in their own minds. It is these proceedings, so unusual, so abnormal, and fraught with such possibilities of future danger, which have forced us to take a line of action which, though perfectly legitimate, is certainly also unusual, and which, I believe, no man would agree to take without the greatest reluctance and regret, but which is certainly less unconstitutional than the action which has provoked it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0492"/>
<col>971</col>
The whole immense fabric of the land taxes, costly and complicated and unworkable as I believe those provisions are, are going to give only &#x00A3;50,000 net this year to the Exchequer. Nay, more, two of the most contentious of these taxes&#x2014;I mean the tax on unearned increment, sound in principle, though as a local and not a national impost&#x2014;and the Undeveloped Land Duty, which is wholly bad&#x2014;these two are actually going to cost more during the present year than they will bring in. But these are not the only questionable taxes that are to be imposed upon us which will bring in nothing this year. There is another item which is expected to yield nothing this year, but is to yield &#x00A3;1,370,000 next year, and rather over &#x00A3;2,000,000 in future years. This is the item which is euphemistically described as the "revision"&#x2014;revision is a good word&#x2014;of the Legacy and Succession Duties. The revision consists in raising a three per cent. rate to five per cent.; five and six per cent. to ten per cent.; and in sweeping away altogether&#x2014;I greatly regret this&#x2014;the exemption enjoyed by lineals and husbands and wives from the payment of the Legacy Duty, they having in the past escaped with the already sufficiently heavy payment of Estate Duty. In my humble judgment this is one of the very worst features of the Death Duty clauses, as the Death Duty clauses are among the worst features of the Budget. I fully admit that it is not this or that tax, but it is the cumulative effect of these repeated onslaughts on capital which is fraught with so much danger to the national prosperity, to enterprise, and to employment.<lb/>
But I would venture to say a few words on the Death Duty clauses specially, because this is a subject with which I am peculiarly familiar. I am not going to recite particular instances of hardship, although I might give many illustrations; but it is not the personal but the national aspect of this taxation, its effect upon enterprise, its tendency to check enterprise, and diminish employment which are the considerations which cause me solicitude. Do we realise, my Lords, the Rake's Progress in which we have been engaged for the last twenty years in overstraining this particular source of revenue? When Sir William Harcourt introduced the Budget of 1894 the Death Duties stood at a little under &#x00A3;10,000,000. He estimated that he was going to increase them by &#x00A3;4,000,000&#x2014;
<col>972</col>
from &#x00A3;10,000,000 to &#x00A3;14,000,000. As a matter of fact, owing partly to the fact that he had underestimated the effect of his duties and partly to the fact that these duties have been greatly increased again only two years ago, they now stand at &#x00A3;19,000,000. If the proposals of the present Budget were adopted they would stand a few years hence, if there is no under-calculation again, at &#x00A3;26,500,000. From &#x00A3;10,000 000 to &#x00A3;26,500,000 in less than twenty years is a rather startling advance.<lb/>
But, my Lords, that is not the whole story. The ominous fact is that the well from which we are drawing so very freely is not one of increasing abundance. If you take the amount of property liable to Estate Duty as shown by the Inland Revenue returns it shows, for the last ten years at any rate, no advance whatsoever. The accumulated wealth of this country, so far as it can be judged from these figures&#x2014;and I know of none that are more fairly indicative, all statistics being, of course, liable to a certain amount of error and having to be read with a certain amount of judgment&#x2014;I know nowhere in our published statistics, figures better indicative of the state of the accumulated wealth of the country. But the accumulated wealth as shown in those figures is not remarkably progressive. It is alarmingly stationary. Let any one run his eye over these statistics as he will find them on page 48 of the annual report of the Inland Revenue, and he cannot come to any other conclusion than that there is no tendency shown by those figures either in one direction or the other. The accumulated wealth of the nation seems to be on something like a dead level&#x2014;a very disquieting fact when we consider, on the one hand, the growth of the population, and on the other the enormous increase during these very years in the total wealth of the world.<lb/>
My Lords, if this revenue is showing the vast increase to which I have just called attention, it is not because capital is increasing, but it is simply because a larger proportion of it is being absorbed by the State. That is a process which cannot go on without ultimately diminishing capital itself. It is a feature of this age that there is the greatest conflict of opinion on all questions of public finance. There is no principle, however time-honoured, which is advanced by one set of pundits, but you can easily find another set of pundits to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0493"/>
<col>973</col>
contradict it. But there is at least one fiscal principle still unchallenged, one which I will venture to put forward as still undisputed and indisputable, and that is that when any source of revenue ceases to show expansion it is bad policy to increase your demands upon that particular source unless there is absolutely no other source to which you can have recourse. Such a proceeding is clearly suicidal; in common language, it is killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.<lb/>
Well, now, there is one source of revenue which we have abused so much already that an increase of rate no longer produces a proportionate or anything like a proportionate increase of yield. I refer to the Liquor Duties. It is true that the Government now say that they are very glad that the addition to the liquor duties which they have made is only bringing in half as much as they estimated. Its moral excellence&#x2014;such is the argument&#x2014;compensates for its financial absurdity. But even they cannot say that of the over-taxation of capital. Why, even Mr. Keir Hardie and his friends do not object to capital; they only want to abolish the capitalist. The Death Duties are popular in some quarters because they are regarded as means of transferring capital from the individual to the State, but their effect is not to transfer capital as capital, but simply to spend it. The whole question is whether we can afford to spend so much capital. My Lords, the answer to that question lies in a nutshell. May I put it in this way? If these periodic fines on capital, which is what the Death Duties amount to, are so moderate in amount that the sum taken by the State can on the average be replaced between fine and fine by accumulation, then they are a convenient and justifiable method of raising revenue; but if they are so heavy that capital cannot recover between fine and fine, then they are a wasteful and ruinous method of raising it. Now, looking at the figures, as I have looked at them over and over again, I can only say that it is evident to me, speaking as a financier and statistician&#x2014;if I have the slightest claim to respect in either of those characters&#x2014;that we have reached the utmost limit in this particular line of taxation which is compatible with not causing a diminution in the object taxed. If that is so, then the enormous additional burden now contemplated, twice, or very nearly twice, as great as that made by Sir William Harcourt in
<col>974</col>
1894, is bound to push us over the line on to the slope which leads down to national impoverishment.<lb/>
There is another weighty argument against the increase of these particular duties. I have not time to go into it at length, but I will try to indicate it in a sentence or two. At the time when these duties were increased by Sir William Harcourt, there was no differentiation in the Income Tax between earned incomes and incomes derived from property. But if just, it is both equitable and financially sound, that incomes derived from property should contribute to the national expenditure at a somewhat higher rate than earned incomes. The effect of the Death Duties, which may be regarded as equivalent to an Income Tax on incomes derived from property, was to establish that differentiation. But since then we have differentiated on the Income Tax itself. Therefore you now have this differentiation twice over. I think there was a strong case when differentiation was introduced into the Income Tax for revising the Death Duties, not in that sense of revision of which I have given your Lordships an instance to-night, but in the opposite direction. But there certainly is a very strong case indeed against the present proposal to move in the opposite direction of greatly increasing them. I think that proposal is as indefensible in equity as it is unsound in finance.<lb/>
I have dwelt so long on one particular point that I cannot go through the series of these new taxes. They are all bad. But they are not all equally bad, or rather, they are not all bad for the same reason. Some, like the additional Income Tax, are not bad in themselves, but I should like to have seen them kept in reserve for great, unforeseeable emergencies. I must say I look with some alarm on the tendency to exhaust these invaluable reserves in absolutely normal times. But the worst of it is that all these bad taxes are quite unnecessary. It would have been perfectly possible, in my opinion, to raise the whole of the &#x00A3;13,000,000, which are being raised by taxation, by import duties. Yes, not only without injury to business and employment, but with actual benefit to both. I know that the possibility of doing this is called in question, though it is astonishing to me that those who call it in question never seem to take the trouble of actually investigating what is done in this direction in foreign countries. For my
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0494"/>
<col>975</col>
part, I am unaffected by these <i>ex parte</i> arguments, and I am prepared, at the proper time and place, to deal with them in detail. All I will say to your Lordships to-night is that I should very much like to try, and I hold that, before the country is committed to a wrong road in this matter of vital importance, it should at least have the opportunity of deciding whether it would not prefer to take the right one. I should like this House to be instrumental in giving it that opportunity.<lb/>
As for the contention that in doing so we shall be transcending our powers, and that because, if we suspend this particular Finance Bill, therefore we should make it a practice of treating similarly all such Bills in future with which we do not happen to agree, it seems to me a patent absurdity. We have always had this right. We have never exercised it. But we have always distinctly reserved to ourselves the right to exercise it. That right has been admitted over and over again even by Liberal Statesmen, precisely because they recognised that there might be once in many years a Budget of such an exceptional and extraordinary character that this House could not be expected not to demur to it. That exceptional occasion has now arisen. How exceptional it is is constantly and vehemently pressed upon us by the author of this Budget himself. He never ceases to proclaim that it is not the immediate financial problem which he is so much concerned about as the social revolution which he is initiating. If his words mean anything, we must regard him as otherwise than a friend to the institution of the private ownership of land. There are those behind him who avowedly are enemies to the private ownership of anything. If we wish to maintain that principle of private ownership, if we believe that the country is not prepared for the threatened gigantic change, we cannot shrink from the conflict which is now forced upon us.<lb/>
I would say a very few words in conclusion with regard to the confusion and the loss of revenue which it is alleged will arise from the contemplated action on the part of this House. The noble Marquess who moved the Amendment said that my noble friend, Lord Welby, had not made his flesh creep by his gloomy prognostications on this subject. Well, I am not surprised at that. Lord Welby is a master of finance, none better, but even all his
<col>976</col>
ability could make nothing of so poor a case. It seems to be forgotten that all these terrible consequences which are to arise if the Budget does not succeed in passing this House would equally have arisen if it had failed to pass the House of Commons, as other Budgets, even within our own time, have failed to pass that House. Is it therefore contended that the House of Commons has no right to reject a Budget after it has once accepted the Resolutions upon which it was founded? What is the extent of the possible mischief? It is said that the Income Tax and the Tea Duty could not be collected. Yes, that is perfectly true. There might be a short interval during which they could not be collected, or could not be legally collected. But everybody knows that whatever Government is in power they would be legalised before the end of the financial year. During the interval between the dissolution of one Parliament and the assembling of another nobody could be compelled to pay, but why anybody should want not to pay when it is perfectly certain he will be compelled to pay before the end of the financial year, I for one cannot for the life of me imagine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03454"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: The Tea Duties, could you collect them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03455"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member><membercontribution>: I will deal with that point. It may be that there will be an attempt to clear a large quantity of tea&#x2014;I think that is what the noble Lord is referring to&#x2014;in the interval between the dissolution of one Parliament and the passing of the Resolutions by another. As a matter of fact, I believe that there would be considerable practical difficulties standing in the way of the dealers over that clearance. The practice, I understand, is for the shippers and the proprietors of gardens to warehouse the tea free on its arrival in this country. The dealers who buy it from them pay, in the first instance, only a deposit. They then leave the tea in the warehouses until they want it, drawing it out in comparatively small quantities as required. When they draw it out they have to pay the balance of the sum due by them for the tea. It would be highly inconvenient for the dealers to draw out a great deal more than they could quickly sell, because they would have to put up the money which they could only slowly recover from their customers, and at the same time they would be embarrassed in finding storehouse room other than that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0495"/>
<col>977</col>
to which they are accustomed. I do not mean to say that even these considerations would prevent them from attempting it if they saw a chance of escaping the duty altogether; but inasmuch as a record can be kept, indeed must legally be kept, of all the tea as it goes out, I do not see how they could hope to escape altogether when the tax was subsequently legalised, and, therefore, I do not believe they would be tempted to face these inconveniences.<lb/>
But it may be said, How about the additional duties on spirits, on tobacco, and so forth? If this measure or a similar one ultimately becomes law, those duties will have to be paid; and if it does not become law they will no longer have to be paid, as we contend that they ought not to be. But the amount of these duties from now to the end of the financial year will in any case not be very considerable. It may be asked, what of the additional duties already paid, if they are not finally confirmed by Act of Parliament? I see no reason why they should be repaid. The importers have already transferred the burden to the consumers, and if the duties were repaid, they would not be repaid to the people who had borne the burden; it would be simply putting money into the pockets of the importers. As a matter of fact there is a good precedent for not repaying them. In 1902, when the coin duty was imposed, the, duty on maize was 5<i>d</i>. in the Resolution, but in the Bill it was reduced to 2&#x00BD;<i>d</i>. Nevertheless, the difference was only repaid in those cases in which it could be shown that the person paying the duty had not already recovered it from some party to whom he had transferred the maize. That seems to me a perfectly just proceeding which forms a precedent for the present case. I am not arguing that there would not be a certain amount of inconvenience, that there might not be a slight leakage of revenue. But I do say that any such inconvenience and loss will be comparatively so trivial that it cannot be weighed in the balance for one moment against the high political and financial considerations which have been adduced in this House, in support of the Amendment of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
In the impressive speech to which we listened to-night the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery, while condemning the Budget in terms even more severe than I should venture to employ, nevertheless
<col>978</col>
urged and almost implored your Lordships not to take a course that might be fatal because of the misconstruction to which you would be exposed and the danger which such a course would involve to your Lordships' House. I am sure of those misconstructions. I recognise the danger. But, though I hardly venture to oppose my authority or lack of authority, to a Statesman whose opinion justly carries such weight with your Lordships as does that of the noble Earl, I must say that I think that the course which he recommended would be deadly to the reputation of this House in the country. If we believe, as he believes and as I believe, that this Budget if passed would indict injury of the most serious kind upon the gravest national interests, then I cannot justify to myself the course of passing it. Nor do I believe that the people of this country would think better of a body of men who, holding these convictions, did pass this Budget. To my mind the position is a very simple one. If the Budget is not an abnormally bad one, I think we ought to pass it, as we have in silence passed some pretty bad Budgets in previous years. But if in our opinion it really is abnormally bad, if it is a measure having the most far-reaching consequences of a disastrous kind, how can we allow the country to suffer those disasters which we clearly foresee? With a perfect sense of the gravity of the position, with a deep feeling of the responsibility which rests on every individual member of this House in the present crisis, but with a clear conscience and a great faith that our action and the motives which have prompted it will be justly and fairly judged by our fellow-countrymen, I shall give my vote in support of the Amendment of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>

Marquess who leads the Opposition, which undoubtedly have been sufficiently potent to induce him to take the very remarkable and unprecedented action which he proposes to this House in order, I will not say to refuse the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, but to postpone, at all events, its full consideration by the House until the judgment of the country has been obtained upon it.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Milner, in the course of his interesting speech, made the remarkable avowal that it was, from his point of view, hardly necessary to consider in great detail the different proposals for taxation which are contained in the Finance Bill. We were not unprepared for this attitude on the part of the noble Viscount. I have in my possession an extract from a recent speech of the noble Viscount in which he said that from his point of view, the worst feature of all about the Budget was that it was intended to side-track Tariff Reform; that it was a bad solution of the financial difficulty, expressly designed to preclude the adoption of a good solution. After such a declaration as that, we could hardly expect from the noble Viscount an unprejudiced examination of the contents of the Finance Bill, and I was not therefore surprised that, after one or two very interesting criticisms of a few of its provisions, he passed from them with a statement that on the whole everyone of the proposals in the Bill was bad and was impossible as a solution of our financial difficulties; that there was only one solution of our financial difficulties, and that that was in the direction of Tariff Reform.<lb/>
I would commend that observation to my noble friends Lord Rosebery, Lord Cromer, and Lord St. Aldwyn, and others who, while objecting to this Budget, as many of them do with great vehemence, have hitherto declared their absolute adherence to the great principles of Free Trade, who have never bowed the knee to Baal and have rejected what we at all events on this side consider the fallacious doctrines of Tariff Reform.<lb/>
The noble Viscount really cast aside the Budget as a sort of worthless document which contained within it no feature whatever which, even subject to modification, could possibly be utilised for the purpose of establishing our financial equilibrium. After such an attitude I really think it is hardly necessary for me to follow
<col>980</col>
the noble Viscount in detail in connection with the criticisms he did make. But I would make this sole observation, that the noble Viscount made one remark which is of an invaluable character when we remember the various controversies that surround the whole question of Tariff Reform. It will be remembered that some questions were addressed to the noble Viscount in reference to the difficulties that would arise in the case of the postponement of the Finance Bill in consequence of the duties already paid upon certain imported articles, tea and so on. The noble Viscount gave us an explanation, which, in view of his having been head of a great department in connection with the Customs and also with the Treasury, we listened to with much interest. He made this remarkable slip&#x2014;he will perhaps regret it subsequently when he remembers it&#x2014;that there would be no difficulty in coming to an accommodation upon the matter because the importers of those articles have introduced the bulk of their various imports and have already passed the duties on to the consumer. Well, I welcome that declaration because at least it amounts to this, that we have one of the foremost exponents of Tariff Reform in this House admitting the contention, from which we have never for one moment swerved, that barring certain rare cases in exceptional circumstances and in minor degree all these duties ultimately fall upon the consumer and upon the consumer alone.<lb/>
I am sure we have all listened with the greatest interest and in many respects with pleasure, to the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, who has unfortunately found himself unable to act on this occasion, as, I am sorry to say, on some other occasions, with the great Party which he had once the honour of leading. We regret our differences of opinion with him, but we cannot, unfortunately, abandon our view that in this matter of the Budget we are taking the only line which is consistent with our Liberal faith, and that is the line of Free Trade, and that the Budget, whatever may be said with regard to certain of its details, at all events reposes upon the principle which, as a Party, we have always upheld and which, I trust, we shall never relinquish.<lb/>
The very interesting debate which has taken place I would venture to say has been somewhat discursive in many particulars
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0497"/>
<col>981</col>
because the Budget has been, in some of the speeches, the very last subject which has been considered or discussed. Now, I am going to ask you to allow me to deal for a short time with the Budget, and with the objections which have been raised to it. As I said, this Budget has been drawn on Free Trade principles. Everybody knows that we have to deal with a very great expenditure and I suppose no one will deny that that expenditure must be met in some way or other. I confess that in considerable degree I share the apprehensions which were so ably expressed by Earl Russell last night with regard to the lavish, and, in my opinion, generally wanton expenditure which has taken place in connection with our bloated armaments. I view that with alarm; I might say with quite as much alarm as was expressed this afternoon by Earl Rosebery, who said that eventually they would lead to the bankruptcy of Europe. I regret extremely that it has not been the proud privilege of the people of this country to lead the way in a policy of proper economy in these directions and that we have not been able to maintain the great traditions of the Liberal Party on the subject of economy. But be that as it may, the main question we have to consider now and at all times is how to provide for the financial necessities of the year. I observed that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, in the course of his opening speech, summarised his objections to the Budget as it is drawn under six heads. Now, five of those heads may be really grouped under one. It may be said that they were a general objection to any further taxation of land. Land was already burdened; land, I might almost say, was sacred; land must be subjected to no further taxation. Then there was a sixth objection, namely that these taxes were based upon a Socialistic fallacy.<lb/>
Let me take these taxes more or less <i>seriatim</i>. In the first place, let me explain that while I speak of a Free Trade Budget, I speak of a principle which I conceive to be necessary to Free Trade or to Liberalism, and that is a Budget based upon the principle of equality of sacrifice. That, I conceive to be the foundation of this Budget as it must be of all Liberal Budgets&#x2014;equality of sacrifice. Well, in what respect does this Budget in any way vitiate this principle, and in what other kind of respect is there any suggestion or suspicion of this charge of Socialism? Let us take the Income Tax and the Death Duties. I must remark in connection with

this matter that the noble Viscount who denounced the Budget root and branch, who said that every tax and every proposal in it was equally bad, seems entirely to have forgotten the existence of one distinguished Statesman who, I imagine, is his leader, and that is Mr. Balfour. Mr. Balfour has publicly given his acquiescence to, at all events, two of the Budget's methods of taxation. He has admitted the necessity under the circumstances of the increased Income Tax and of the increased Death Duties. We all know that those duties are already high. We all recognise that the charge upon us is considerable. None of us like to pay increased taxation. I do not suppose that even the richest among us, any more than the poorest, welcome any increased annual charge, but we have to bear in mind the circumstances of the case, and the necessities of the hour; and both those conditions, it seems to me, impose upon us the sacrifice which we are called upon to make, and which are comprised under the increased taxation in the Income Tax and the Death Duties. Those duties proceed upon the very principle which I have ventured to enunciate&#x2014;equality of sacrifice. You have the smaller incomes paying less and the larger incomes, particularly those derived from invested wealth and not from earnings, paying more. Is that an unjust principle upon which to proceed? I confess that the Death Duties are a subject upon which many of us enter with some what mixed feelings, because those who have arrived at my time of life have no expectation of inheriting wealth and therefore it is more a question of what is going to happen with what we possess when we die, and upon that subject I can only say that those persons of the younger generation who happen to have the good fortune of inheriting whatever we may be able to leave them surely have no ground of complaint if they have to pay some contribution to the national requirements in proportion to the sums that they receive.<lb/>
I pass from that to the Licence Duties. The Licence Duties deal with what I imagine must be recognised, and fairly recognised, as one of the great monopolies of the State, a monopoly which has grown up under the &#x00E6;gis of the State and which has grown to proportions which some of us regard with great apprehension and with grave misgivings. That monopoly is the great liquor traffic of which Earl Rosebery, at an earlier period of his career, spoke as threatening to strangle the State unless the State was prepared to strangle it.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0498"/>
<col>983</col>
And he was perfectly right. The liquor traffic has grown up under the protection of the State which has created a vast monopoly and I suppose no one in this House will deny that large fortunes have been made out of it; that immense accretions of capital have been created and have gone into the pockets of those who were so fortunate, if we may use the term, as to be engaged in it in its prosperous period. In that prosperous period no doubt large numbers of those who were engaged in this particular trade thought the opportunity good to transfer their holdings to bodies of shareholders. I much sympathise with those unfortunate shareholders. I regret the position in which they find themselves; but I say with all emphasis that it is no part of the duty of the State to intervene between shareholders, however confiding, and the consequences of their own credulity or folly. It may be perfectly true that loss will fall upon certain people in connection with this matter, but the principle itself is a just one. It is a just principle which says that the State should resume a portion of the wealth which the State too lavishly allowed to be created, and all I can say is that I, as a friend of temperance, will rejoice if the great monopoly has, to a certain extent, to draw in its horns and to further a certain restriction of the opportunities for drinking and for that intemperance which is one of the gravest evils affecting our national life. Does not that increase of Licence Duties also proceed upon the same principle of equality of sacrifice? Does it not also maintain that principle in the proposal that the smaller houses, the less productive houses, should pay the least charge for licences, and that those who have the greatest revenue and which enjoy the greatest profits from this trade should pay the largest Licence Duties? It seems to me that with regard to the Licence Duties, just in the same way as with regard to the Income Tax and Death Duties, the Budget proceeds upon lines which are just, and which, at all events commend themselves to the Liberal Party.<lb/>
Now we come to the Land Taxes. With regard to those taxes it may have been observed by those who had the pleasure of listening to the speech of the noble Viscount, Viscount Milner, that in the course of that speech he gave a sort of timid acquiescence in, a half-hearted approval of, the Increment Duty, but in regard to the Undeveloped Land Tax he said it was a bad tax. He did not
<col>984</col>
even discuss it. With respect to the Increment Duty I would merely remark that the question of the taxation of land values is, I was going to say, almost as old as this House. At all events, it is as old as most of us remember. I had the honour of being for a great many years a member of the House of Commons, and I can hardly recall a single year in all that period when I did not receive representations, when I did not attend deputations, when I did not go to meetings, having reference to this question of the taxation of land values. There was not a year when, even on the part of the most Tory Town Councils and the most Conservative municipalities we did not receive representations all tending to this, that the unearned increment in urban land ought to be subjected to taxation.<lb/>
I must make some excuse to the House if I call attention for one brief moment to the fact that during the course of this debate there has been almost unmeasured denunciation of my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in consequence of the speeches which he made at Limehouse and at Newcastle. I am certainly in no sense an apologist for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is well able to take care of himself. I am only speaking in the interests of what I may call common justice and I ask this House this simple question. What has the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in connection with these land taxes, which has not been said before? I am old enough to remember a meeting, a meeting at which I was present, of the Allotments Association, of which the President at that time was my excellent friend Mr. Jesse Collings. That meeting was addressed by a distinguished Statesman whose continued illness we all deplore and in whose sickness we fully sympathise. The subject discussed on that occasion was this very question of the unearned increment in urban land; and it gave rise to a speech from which, perhaps, the House will permit me to quote an extract. What did Mr. Joseph Chamberlain say on that occasion, in January, 1886, in reference to land taxation? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"What does that mean? It means that at this moment the trade of the country is burdened with an annual tax of &#x00A3;2,000,000, which is the price which commerce pays to landlowners for the privilege of improving their property. I think myself that the time has come when this form of ransom should cease, and that it should no longer be considered one of the rights of property to go on blackmailing the public whenever their wants and necessities require them to enter into a bargain."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0499"/>
<col>985</col>
I do not want for one moment to criticise the language of the right hon. gentleman. On the contrary, I cordially agreed with it at the time, as I cordially agree with it to-day. But all I would ask you is how can you turn and stigmatise the language of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer who, in no one single syllable, as far as I know, has gone beyond the declarations of Mr. Chamberlain, now the friend of hon. members opposite, on that occasion in 1886? It seems to me that in this matter, if noble Lords will excuse me for saying so, there is a great deal of cant. We have to deal, undoubtedly, with a serious situation. We have got to find money and large amounts of money under very exceptional difficulties. We have to find it at a time when, no doubt, trade is bad and when circumstances are unfavourable to increased taxation. But I applaud the courage with which the Government have tackled this difficult dilemma and have endeavoured to deal with it, as I think, on right and proper lines.<lb/>
I know it is said that this Budget is going to do all sorts of terrible things. It is undermining credit; it is driving capital abroad; it is destroying confidence: I heard with great pleasure, although I disagree with every syllable of it, the excellent speech made by the noble Lords Lord Revelstoke, in which he expounded that theory with great ability and, I have no doubt, with the most absolute conviction. But I ask the noble Lord, as I ask all your Lordships, this question. Is it not a fact that quite apart from the considerations which were advanced by the noble Lord, namely the contention that various influences are at work driving capital abroad and so on&#x2014;is it not a fact that the most important consideration was left altogether out of the purview of the noble Lord? Is it not a fact quite apart from every other circumstance that we have, unfortunately, to deal with the situation arising out of the fact that we were engaged not long ago&#x2014;although, happily, the circumstances have so far changed that we have almost forgotten it&#x2014;in a war in South Africa, in which we spent &#x00A3;240,000,000 or &#x00A3;250,000,000?<lb/>
It cannot be supposed that our resources of capital can be depleted by so large a sum as that without its having an effect upon our national credit. One of the principal contentions which was advanced by the noble Lord was that there was a depreciation
<col>986</col>
in British securities. But is it, after all, unreasonable to expect such a depreciation when you have had this exceptional demand upon the national credit? There is also the fact that, in addition to all other matters, we had an Act, the Irish Land Purchase Act, which was passed by the late Conservative Government and with regard to which I have no criticism to offer, which made an enormous demand upon our national credit, which I believe has already absorbed countless millions and which, when it is completely satisfied will, I believe, have required from us no less than &#x00A3;180,000,000 or &#x00A3;190,000,000. In face of that obligation, only partially satisfied, and of the apprehension which is naturally due to the possibilities of further demand in that respect, is it unnatural that there should be a depreciation in British Government securities? When I am told that in the Bank parlour, the sacred precincts of which I do not for one moment suggest I can approach, great apprehension is entertained with regard to the situation of British credit, I may, as a humble investor, be permitted to say that I believe that the apprehensions of that Bank parlour are confined to a very limited circle.<lb/>
I turn now to the last question and, perhaps, in the minds of some noble Lords, the most interesting. This Budget is attacked as being a Socialistic Budget. The noble Marquess who opened the debate has publicly declared his belief that the principles of this Budget are Socialistic. My Lords, we desire to make our situation with regard to this matter absolutely clear. What is meant by "Socialistic"? Of course it may be said that any programme, which embraces the sort of social progress and social reform in which gentlemen of liberal views on both sides of this House and in every other Assembly would be prepared to participate, is Socialism. But when I speak of Socialism I want it to be clearly understood that I speak of what may be called "revolutionary Socialism." By "revolutionary Socialism" I mean that class of Socialism which is identified with the doctrines of Karl Marx, and with what is generally understood as German Socialism. Happily, until this date, that kind of Socialism had but a very small foothold in this country. That was due to the fortunate circumstance that the Liberal Party in this country had always understood the obligation of advancing
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0500"/>
<col>987</col>
with the times; had always felt how necessary it was to push forward social progress and social reform in order to meet the growing demands of the always extending community. The day has come when, unfortunately, we are face to face with this situation, that circumstances are going, I am afraid, to give to that kind of Socialism of which I have spoken a much larger extension in this country. That international Socialism which existed, as I say, in such small and limited circles here could not feed upon a soil which was happily impregnated with the principles of Free Trade, the principles which enabled the most humble of our fellow citizens to obtain all their necessaries of life under the most favourable conditions and at the cheapest rate. The position is now about to be changed. The issue for them is really one as between Fiscal Reform and Free Trade.<lb/>
Fiscal Reform has been represented to us as something very different from Tariff Reform in foreign countries or from Protection as we knew it. We are told it is to be scientific. I have great suspicion of the term "scientific" in connection with this matter. Is there a country in the world where science is so carefully nourished, where science has such widespread application, where science is applied in so many and ingenious forms as in Germany. Germany enjoys a "scientific tariff," and I ask you who are in favour of a policy which I am endeavouring to combat, to cast your eyes over to Germany, and to ask yourselves what is the result of the "scientific tariff" in Germany? Why, the very revolutionary Socialism which you apprehend here has grown in Germany to almost portentous dimensions. The Socialist vote in Germany is growing year by year. It has grown from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 and I am informed on the best authority that it is likely to attain no less a number than 4,000,000 or even 5,000,000 at the next election in Germany. That is Socialism bred upon Protection. I am aware that there are noble Lords opposite who say that there is something to be borrowed from Germany in the sense that there is in Germany an Income Tax which is comprehensive; and I am told that some of the Conservative Free Traders believe that a comprehensive Income Tax without any kind of exclusion would possibly terminate our financial difficulties. In Germany every citizen who earns the sum of 18<i>s</i>. a week pays Income Tax.
<col>988</col>
But what is the situation of the unfortunate German worker? There are 22,000,000 of them&#x2014;I speak of both sexes&#x2014;who earn less than 18<i>s</i>. a week&#x2014;22,000,000 of these unfortunate people earning less than 18<i>s</i>. a week and yet it is suggested that we should cast our eyes over the water! The noble Viscount invites us to take our example from Germany and to introduce into this country a system of Fiscal Reform which means undoubtedly the embarrassment of the poor, because it means making them pay more for all they use, for all they eat; as it would also mean the destruction of the life-blood of our national prosperity and commerce. That is the policy which is recommended to us by noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
"Let us have," the noble Viscount declared this afternoon, "a free hand to try a scientific tariff." I regret that the noble Viscount, even under the possible consequences of future developments, can never be the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the future; but I should think that, even if he were, his task would be a sorry one. To introduce Tariff Reform into this country, and to assume that it would in any way stem the tide of revolutionary Socialism, I believe to be an absolute chimera, and those who entertain it are doomed to disappointment.<lb/>
I have only one further observation to make. The action which is suggested by the noble Marquess, the action which is about to be taken by your Lordships' House is, I assume, one which is supposed to be by those who are about to support it a highly ingenious device for attracting the electors. It is imagined that the electors will say, "Oh, what a democratic House of Lords this is. It has deferred to the judgment of the electors the final verdict upon the Budget." I conceive that there never was a greater illusion than that. It is not your Lordships' function to decide what will be the particular conclusion or the particular points which will be referred to the electors. That has always been, and will be now, the duty and the obligation of the Government of the day and of the Party which is now in power. Do you suppose for one moment that it would be merely the consideration of whether this Budget should be allowed to pass into law or not? Such a situation is impossible.<lb/>
You have raised a grave constitutional question. You have flouted the almost immemorial practice of this House with
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0501"/>
<col>989</col>
regard to finance. Perhaps I may be excused for reminding your Lordships of the immortal words of my great kinsman Lord Chatham, who said that the power of the purse was deposited solely within the control of the Commons. For 200 years that great principle has remained inviolate. For 200 years it has never been seriously assailed. Do you suppose for one moment that when the electors of this country are consulted they will merely give their verdict, "Aye" or "No," upon the question of the Budget. My Lords, they will give their verdict upon another question. They will give their verdict, and rightly give their verdict, upon the question whether the power of the purse is to remain permanently as it should remain, in the hands of the Commons; whether that great privilege, that great possession, which, in the words of Lord Chatham, was essential to our liberty&#x2014;whether that great privilege and that great right is to be taken from them and to be transferred to this House. That will be the question which the electorate will be called upon to decide. Your Lordships cannot make the issues. You cannot propound the particular questions which the electors will be called upon to answer. I say to you, although, perhaps, I have no special claim to speak with so much frankness on this subject, that when that verdict is given it will be given in favour of two objects. It will be given first of all in favour of the principles contained in this Budget. But, above all, it will be given in favour of the commanding principle that the power of the purse, that the great privileges of the Commons, shall no longer rest upon custom, which you have broken, but shall be made certain, shall be secured by an enactment which shall re-establish on a sounder basis the present relations between the two Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
I thank the House for listening to me with the kind consideration it has shown. I can only say that I hope in what I have said I have offended no member of it. At all events I have stated with sincerity and with the warmth of feeling which I entertain with regard to these high constitutional matters, the grave issue which will not be decided by your vote upon this Bill, but which will shortly be decided by the greater vote of the people of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03458"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I
<col>990</col>
wish to speak in support of the Amendment which has been so ably moved by the Leader of the Opposition. If I had any previous doubts on this matter, which I confess I never had, as to the policy of supporting this Amendment, those doubts would have been completely removed after having heard the strong and the forcible arguments of the noble Marquess as to his reasons for submitting this Amendment to your Lordships' House. I feel sure that the noble Marquess will receive the loyal support, not only of the majority of his followers on this side of the House, but of a great many on the other side of the House. No one can reasonably doubt that the advice that the noble Marquess has tended to us on this question, has been dictated by the most disinterested conception of public duty. I think he was perfectly justified when he asked if we passed this Budget what guarantee have we that there will not be included in future Budgets either a Home Rule Bill or a Welsh Disestablishment Bill? As your Lordships are aware, this House has of late been frequently assailed by certain violent members of His Majesty's Government who have been good enough to tell us what is likely to happen if we hesitate to pass this Bill into law. They have told us that such action would involve an appeal to the country and that the result of that appeal might mean the ending or the mending of your Lordships' House. In politics, as in individual life, the right has often to be undertaken with a scorn of consequences. But I believe the electorate generally&#x2014;speaking at any rate, for the county of Kent where I think I know their feelings on this question fairly well&#x2014;will approve the proposed action of your Lordships' House in submitting the entire issue to the popular vote and acting with a single eye to the good of the country and of the Empire. In fact I believe they expect us to take that action. I believe, too, that your Lordships' House will be all the more respected throughout the country for contemptuously disregarding the threats that have been indulged in against us, and that the hope of certain members of His Majesty's Government that by passing this Amendment a great storm of national indignation will be raised against us will be once more rudely disappointed.<lb/>
For I cannot believe for one moment that the country as a whole is likely to quarrel with us for exercising the elementary and indispensable function of a Second Chamber.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0502"/>
<col>991</col>
I am perfectly aware that noble Lords on the other side assert that this House has no such function. I think the noble Marquess clearly disproved that idea. Surely I am justified in asking those noble Lords opposite who hold that view, to tell us what they regard as the chief duty of a Second Chamber in a democratic country. Surely it is to take care that principles such as are involved in this Budget shall not be passed into law without the people of this country having the opportunity of pronouncing their opinion upon them. I contend that the principles involved in this Budget constitute an entirely new departure from orthodox Liberal finance&#x2014;a departure for which no one can truthfully say a mandate was given at the last General Election. Therefore, it appears to me that in taking such a course we shall only be giving the nation the opportunity to decide its own destiny. In the course of this debate many arguments have been brought forward against this measure. To my mind the strongest objections to it are these. First, I believe it is the only occasion when a Budget has been introduced into the House of Commons mainly for the purpose of penalising political opponents and at the same time bribing political supporters of the Government by the incorporation of a Land Bill and a Licensing Bill in this measure.<lb/>
My second objection to the measure is that it has been cunningly devised as a vehicle for Socialistic revolution; for no one can deny that this measure adopts in principle the doctrines of the extreme Socialistic Party, whilst it provides at the same time all the machinery that is necessary for carrying those doctrines into effect at any time hereafter. No doubt the Chancellor of the Exchequer thinks such tactics clever. In my opinion they are far too clever to succeed, for I do not think for one moment that the country is likely to oblige him by helping forward such ingenious tactics in politics. Hitherto, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been regarded as the custodian of the public purse and as holding that office in order to safeguard the financial interests of the country. Apparently that is to be no more. Anyhow, I believe that the country as a whole well remember the services that have been rendered by your Lordships' House in rejecting a few years ago the Home Rule Bill, and I believe they are equally satisfied with us for faithfully
<col>992</col>
dealing with the Licensing Bill and the Education Bill. Most of your Lordships on this side of the House, at any rate, will agree that a Budget always has been, and should be, a financial measure for the purpose of providing the needs of the year and nothing else, a measure which your Lordships' House as a rule passes as a matter of course in the same way as an auditor passes the accounts of a public company. But I maintain that this measure contains a great deal more than that. It not only contains a Licensing Bill but it contains a Land Valuation Bill and a Land Nationalisation Bill as well. There can be little doubt that the two great national problems that this country has to decide at the present moment are national defence and unemployment. The first can only be attained by ensuring that our first line of defence is kept up to the two-Power standard, which the Prime Minister said in the House of Commons on November 19, 1908, meant this&#x2014;" a preponderance of ten per cent. over the combined strength in capital ships of the two largest navies." It is quite certain that this cannot be achieved if we in this country spend on new construction less than one-half of what the two next strongest navies are spending. Is it to be wondered at that many of our Naval officers have constantly been asked by Foreign Naval officers this question, "What is coming to England in letting her Navy drop off as it is and not seeing, or not wanting to see, that Germany is going on by leaps and bounds until in 1911 she will equal you in first-class battleships and cruisers?"<lb/>
It will be in the recollection of your Lordships' House that when this Budget was first introduced we were told that the increased burden of taxation was owing to the increased expenditure on the Navy; but this Budget only provides, or has earmarked for that purpose &#x00A3;3,000,000, which is to be found out of the Sinking Fund, whilst the second contingent of four Dreadnoughts, which we are told are about to be put down, is to be charged to next year's Budget. Therefore, I think no one can say this Budget does anything for national defence.<lb/>
We now come to that other national question of unemployment. I maintain until anybody on the other side can show me to the contrary, that this Budget will increase that evil rather than diminish it. No one, I think, can deny this fact,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0503"/>
<col>993</col>
that in no other great civilised country in the world does unemployment prevail to such an extent as it does in the United Kingdom. What is the reason for that? There can be no reason except that we of all the great countries in the world still continue to persist in that system falsely called Free Trade, which is primarily the cause of the working classes in this country suffering from unfair competition. Lord Curzon, in a very strong and forcible speech on this question the other day, appears to have hit the right nail on the head when he asked, "Are we never to take toll of the foreigner; are all other countries fools because they flourish by declining to follow our example? "<lb/>
It is for this reason that we on this side of the House advocate a change in our fiscal policy by means of a scientific tariff, which does not mean in any sort of way Protection any more than Free Trade means free imports. I would, therefore, like to ask any member of His Majesty's Government in your Lordships' House to tell us how this Budget will be able to cure that disease from which British labour has long been suffering, namely the evil of unemployment. I ask that question because I believe it will have the opposite effect. That is what the noble Duke, the Duke of Marlborough, said last night&#x2014;it will greatly accentuate the disease by the imposition on novel principles of new duties on capital. No one, I think, can deny this point, that it is upon capital and its undiminished security that the working classes must rely for their wages and employment. And as Lord Curzon said in the same speech, with which I fully agree, what the British workman wants at the present time is work. "Where is it," he asks, "in the fiery rhetoric of the Chancellor of the Exchequer?" It is the one thing that is absent. It is primarily for those reasons to which I have alluded that I believe your Lordships' House will gain rather than lose popularity in the country by submitting this portentous measure to the electors. It is for this reason, too, that I shall without the least hesitation have pleasure in supporting the Amendment of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03459"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I take the liberty of addressing you on the Motion before your Lordships I wish to say a few words with, regard to a speech delivered by Lord Weardale. First of all
<col>994</col>
I may say I took that speech as an answer to Lord Milner, who can take very good care of himself. Lord Milner being a Tariff Reformer and Lord Weardale being a Free Trader, I took that speech as being entirely framed on those lines and on those principles. But there was one thing Lord Weardale said in his speech that I wish to call your Lordships' attention to. He said that the great principle of the Liberal Party was economy. Now, we are all perfectly aware that the Liberal Party went to the polls pledged to economy. They gained many votes on that understanding. I will only speak of one measure, and that is the Old Age Pensions Act. I know in my country that is not a very economical measure. I think the Liberal Party have had to pay for the experience of Old Age Pensions as applied to Ireland, from what I read in the papers.<lb/>
Then Lord Weardale went on to talk about the equality of sacrifice, and that motto ran through the whole of his speech&#x2014;"equality of sacrifice." Well, my answer to that is that I think both the poor and the rich are being sacrificed under the Liberal Government's Budget. Lord Weardale said that Tariff Reform will make the poor people of this country pay more for all they use and all they eat. [Hear, hear.] Members say "Hear, hear." All they eat&#x0021; Well, we have heard that before. I wonder whether your Lordships remember the speech Lord Goschen made in this House when the duty of a shilling per quarter was put on wheat. He took that duty when it was attacked and when it was said the poor man would pay more for his food, and he reduced the bag down to loaves and pointed out that it was a fraction of a farthing more which the poor man had to pay for his loaf. What then becomes of that argument? All that is suggested&#x2014;I am not going to make a Tariff Reform speech&#x2014;is that there should be 2<i>s</i>. put on corn. I will pass from that because it is not my business to deal with that question.<lb/>
The Amendment before your Lordships' House is so plain that I venture to say it will be clearly understood by every elector not only in this country but in the country which I come from. The House in adopting the Amendment is adhering to the principle which it has adhered to for many years, that is, that it can refuse to read a second time a Budget and a Finance Bill. And we are fortified in this principle by the precedent
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0504"/>
<col>995</col>
of Parliamentary custom. Now, I allude with all deference to the words of the Lord Chancellor. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Every year all the Estates of the Realm combined to pay homage to the rights of the House of Commons in regard to money Bills. The Crown itself acknowledges their power."</quote>
But may I put it that the Commons, as one of the Estates of the Realm, have, on more than one occasion, admitted the right of the House of Lords to reject or even amend a Money Bill. If I pursue that subject further I should like to quote some words of a former Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, who declared that nothing to be found in Parliamentary journals or the history of Parliamentary proceedings showed that our right to reject Money Bills had been questioned. We had no right whatever to amend a Money Bill, Lord Lyndhurst said. I should like to quote the words of one of the great Leaders of the Liberal Party, Mr. Gladstone, a name that we all in Ireland remember very well indeed. Mr. Gladstone said on May 16, 1861&#x2014;
<quote>"The powers of this House must remain greater on the whole than those of the House of Lords, but I believe that to infringe the privileges of the House of Lords or to cripple the functions of that august Assembly would he as fatal to the balance of the Constitution as would be the loss of the privileges of this House itself."</quote>
Then Mr. Gladstone again, speaking much later, in 1894, said in the House of Commons, addressing the Speaker&#x2014;
<quote>"No doubt, sir, there is a higher authority than the House of Commons; it is the authority of the nation that must in the last resort decide."</quote>
Well, what are the terms of this Motion? The terms of this Motion are that we leave it to the nation to decide whether this Budget is to be accepted by the nation or not. I should like again to address the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and mention some words of his with the greatest respect. He was speaking of the Constitution and the law, and he said according to law we can reject the Budget but according to the Constitution he did not think we could. And he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The difference between what can be done according to law and what can be done in accordance with the Constitution under which we live is notorious and fundamental. The law definitely fixes rules. What would happen if all the Estates of the Realm were to carry out in freedom all the powers that the law entrusts to them? The Crown has enormous powers, which by the Constitution for centuries have not been used."</quote>
But, my Lords, the powers of the House of
<col>996</col>
Lords have really been exercised for centuries, and they have been exercised with effect. I do not think I need pursue that subject any further, but I should like to say something further upon the Motion. The Motion is no actual rejection, as I said before, because the electors will have to decide upon this question. Lord Weardale warned us&#x2014;I have often heard the warning before&#x2014;to the effect that something dreadful would happen if we were to do this. We are not living in the times of 1831 when the whole country was convulsed with revolution in consequence of the Lords not passing the Reform Bill, when Bristol was nearly burnt down and was saved by the pluck and energy of a Captain of Yeomanry. We are not living in those times, and I am not in the least disturbed or frightened by those terrible threats which emanate from noble Lords opposite. In Ireland we are often threatened. We live sometimes in an atmosphere of threats, but I ask what can be fairer, and after all what can be more democratic if we appeal to the sovereign power which is lodged in the collective body of the people?<lb/>
Many of us begin to think that the Government are shrinking from facing the people on this question, and I believe they fear it immensely. And the noble Lord alluded to the speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Well, he made a celebrated speech not far from here, namely down at Limehouse, and he denounced noble Lords, Dukes and other members of this House in no unmeasured terms. Lord Willoughby De Broke gave expression to a word which I thoroughly agree with when he said there was a certain amount, I think he said, of vulgarity in that speech. I do not say the whole speech was in that tone, but there was a certain amount of it. No doubt it suited the Limehouse audience. Let me remind your Lordships of a verse in the Ingoldsby Legends which I will read to you. The Chancellor of the Exchequer practically cursed the Dukes. He said on another occasion, I believe, that they were more expensive than Dreadnoughts. In one of the Ingoldsby Legends, "The Jackdaw of Rheims," the words run thus&#x2014;
<quote>"Never was heard such a terrible curse.</quote>
<quote>But what gave rise to no little surprise,</quote>
<quote>Nobody seemed one penny the worse."</quote>
Well, I think the by-elections are rather straws which show the way the wind blows and indicate to us and make us believe that the voters in the country are beginning rather to grasp the inward meaning of this
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0505"/>
<col>997</col>
somewhat intricate Budget. I think before the writs are issued many noble Lords in this House will endeavour to make them grasp not only the intricate meaning but the inward meaning of many of the intricacies of this Budget.<lb/>
I should like to allude to another matter which the noble Lord opposite made a great point of, that is the Socialistic side in the Budget. He alluded to the Socialism of Karl Marx and the Socialism in Germany. He said because there was Protection in that country Socialism had increased to an enormous extent. I may venture humbly to remark that the Socialistic wedge is being gently tapped in this country. I should like to produce a little evidence to that effect to the supporters of the Government opposite. Mr. Winston Churchill, speaking on September 6, 1909, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Budget was the first conscious attempt on the part of the State to build up a better and more scientific organisation of society for the benefit of the workers of the country."</quote>
That is a very mild form of Socialism. Now we come to what Mr. Keir Hardie said at Saltley, near Birmingham, on September 18, 1909&#x2014;
<quote>"Members of the Labour Party were supporting the Budget knowing it was the first step towards the ideal they had in view, the absorption by the community for the use of the community of all unearned incomes, whether from land or capital."</quote>
I think the wedge was beginning to get another tap there. And then we had Mr. Keir Hardie again, but I won't quote that. But I will quote Mr. Ross Clynes, the Socialist member for North East Manchester. He is reported in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"I think it is pretty well driven home here&#x2014;that ' Ministers as well as the rank and file are now compelled to talk of matters which Socialists had forced to the front, and Mr. Lloyd George's Limehouse speech was famous because all its economic and Socialist items were copied substantially from the speeches of obscure street corner talkers who had been spreading the views of the Labour Party for years. As the policeman says, "from information received," I think it is a long step and a step and a jump in the direction of Socialism pure and simple.'"</quote>
I have only read these extracts in order to prove what the Socialists and the Liberal Party think of the Budget. I think it is quite fair that I have done so. They are supporters of noble Lords opposite and their utterances appear in the public Press from which I have quoted.<lb/>
Now we are told that if we reject this Bill the whole financial provisions of the country
<col>998</col>
will be thrown into confusion. May I remind your Lordships what the noble Marquess said in his speech? I have not the exact words but I know the meaning of them. He said if there was any difficulty on that score he would be quite ready to meet the noble Lords opposite and the Government in passing any measure that would tide over any difficulties of that sort. We are forced to hear that the English Constitution is on the edge of a precipice and that we are about to hurl it over. But those who wish to pass this Budget have in their minds that fear which they choose to call discretion. We lay claim to discretion, too, and it is born in the Amendment before the House. I take it that it is not born of fear but of uprightness. I ask you, "Is this House so out of touch with the national spirit that we are doing something against that spirit?" I do not think so. It will be decided out of this House whether the people will accept the Budget or not, whether the country will accept Socialism as embodied in it and approved of by the Socialist Party, or whether they will adopt bureaucracy by instalment as embodied in this Bill. When I speak of bureaucracy I speak of that army of followers who will be living on good salaries and will be able to exercise on every taxpayer power of a most inquisitorial and despotic character.<lb/>
Now there was something very important the Lord Chancellor said. It has not been alluded to before in this debate and I should like to allude to it. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"In my opinion it is impossible any Liberal Government should ever again bear the heavy burden of office unless it is secured against a repetition of the treatment such as our measures have had to undergo for the last four years."</quote>
Of course, it is a very easy&#x2014;I would not dare to do it&#x2014;to dismiss that most important statement with cheap sarcasm. But what are the measures we have rejected? The Education Bill and the Licensing Bill&#x2014;two very important measures no doubt. But if the country had been behind the Liberal Government on those two questions our "cup," so often mentioned, would have been filled up long ago, and the constitutional issue would not have come now; it would have come then. But it did not come and the country has settled down very quietly to enjoy the Old Age Pensions which were given to it.<lb/>
There was one speech made last night by Lord Russell, who spoke in no
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0506"/>
<col>999</col>
unmeasured terms of the Budget, to to which I will refer. He spoke of the uneconomical policy of the Liberal party&#x2014;the Army was too big, the Navy was too big, and too much money was spent upon them. He said the aristocrats in the Reign of Terror were not afraid of the guillotine but the knife fell none the less, and the action which your Lordships are now taking was, he believed, the beginning of the end of those understandings in the Constitution between the two Houses. He went on to say he would rejoice to see the veto of this House swept away. I am sure the noble Lord would miss his House of Lords. I am sure he would miss coming down and making those clever speeches which we all enjoy and appreciate and listen to, and I might say that in the long and protracted session, kept up by the Liberal Party now, Trafalgar Square or Hyde Park would be a chilly place to speak in if he had not this Chamber. I listened with a great deal of attention to Lord Rosebery's speech. I think we all listened to-day with the very greatest attention to him; but what came across me when I had heard the end of that speech was this&#x2014;I felt it was most inconclusive. I wish the noble Earl was here to listen to what I have to say. [Lord Rosebery here took his seat.] I was saying I always listen with the greatest respect when Lord Rosebery speaks. He lectured your Lordships' House, but the result of that lecture had this effect upon me, that I did not take very careful notes of the lecturer. He denounced the Budget up hill and down dale. He has denounced it before in public; but he said he would not vote for the Amendment before your Lordships' House. I leave my Lord Rosebery there.<lb/>
Perhaps your Lordships will think me somewhat indiscreet if I go on to allude to other speeches, but I must allude to the one made by Lord St. David's. I took particular care to be in the House and listen to every word of it. He dealt largely with finance. He is quite capable of doing so. He also dealt with Protection and Tariff Reform. He said men were kept employed making engines and wagons for South America, and if Tariff Reform came what would become of all that work those men made? What he said with regard to South America was all very well, but he must remember that notwithstanding his efforts in South America there is a great deal of unemployment still in this
<col>1000</col>
country. I have digressed, as an Irishman would say, before I have even got on to the road.<lb/>
I have to put before you the case of Ireland, as it is affected by the Budget. Now the policy which has been carried out with regard to that country in finance is that the tenant has been financed by State aid, under various Land Acts, for the purchase of his farm, and the landlords have been assisted in the same manner, especially by the 1903 Act. The total sums advanced to the tenants have amounted, since the first Land Act was passed, to &#x00A3;62,303,490. I do not see Lord St. David's here to challenge these figures. The capital and interest, I must remind you is being paid back to the uttermost farthing. We are often told, and we feel it very much, that a great deal of English taxpayers' money has been paid over to Ireland without any chance of it coming back. I notice noble Lords are laughing. The truth of the matter is that every penny&#x2014;I am talking quite seriously&#x2014;is paid back, and the Treasury will get its own and get its own over and over again.<lb/>
I wish now to deal with the effect of the Budget on the Irish farmer. You must remember that the Irish farmer has been made a freeholder by State aid. Now you are getting your money back. I speak of the English taxpayer. I am a taxpayer myself as much as anyone else in the House. You are getting your money back by slow degrees, but under this Budget how do you mulct this man, having made him a freeholder? The present duty on the conveyance or transfer on sale of any property is ten per cent. That is increased to twenty per cent. On conveyance on transfers by voluntary disposition the fixed duty is ten per cent. That is increased to twenty per cent. For leases the stamp duties vary according to the rent and the period of the lease. That is doubled. Income Tax does not affect the farmer very much; he is very often not rich enough to pay it. Now we come to the Death Duties. A great many farmers who will have to pay Death Duties will hardly realise what the former Death Duties were. They have had no experience of what the Death Duties were under former Acts. The Death Duties are insidious, far-reaching and unfair. The farmers are ill-prepared to meet the heavy demands for Death Duties. The payment of those Death
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0507"/>
<col>1001</col>
Duties will frequently entail the immediate sale of cattle or other stock at a time when that stock is less ready for market. They may also have to hand over a portion of their lands to the Revenue Commission in payment of the liability under this Budget. Now one cannot conceive anything more outrageous to a class you are creating in that country who have been financed to become peasant proprietors, than that they should, if they cannot pay the Death Duties, have to hand over a portion of their farms, perhaps reducing them to the level of a congested holding. I commend that statement to the noble Earl who had charge of, and so thoroughly well carried out in this House, the Irish Land Bill that we have lately dealt with.<lb/>
There is a fresh valuation to be taken of the whole of the United Kingdom. Every purchasing tenant, whose total assets&#x2014;no allowance being made for duties, money, stock, furniture, and land crops&#x2014;are determined by valuers, will have, if the estimates come to &#x00A3;500 or over, to pay, first a competitive value for his land, and secondly on the capitalised value of the purchase annuity. That is most unjust, and it is extortionate to charge a tenant duty on the competitive value of his farm. The general valuation of the whole of Ireland is prescribed by Clause 26, and the cost will be enormous. But what will touch the Irish farmer, and what he will resent&#x2014;and I think I should feel I was right in telling him to resent it&#x2014;is the sort of inquisitorial questions of the valuers which will have to be answered by him. If he does not answer them he is under a penalty, I think, of &#x00A3;50. We know what Ireland is, at least I do. I think the people who go and ask these questions and search for the information will not have a very pleasant time. And the man who seeks to recover the &#x00A3;50&#x2014;well I pity him if he goes into the district.<lb/>
Now with regard to the Legacy Duties. The Legacy Duties to a brother or sister are raised from the present rate of three per cent. to a duty of five per cent. I am analysing the Bill to a certain extent, my Lords. Other relations under the Bill, except those I have mentioned, are treated as strangers, and a legacy is charged at the rate of ten per cent. Now, let me summarise what the farmers will have to put up with in Ireland. A large body of them who have hitherto paid nothing will
<col>1002</col>
be subject to Death Duties; many others will pay a higher valuation, a higher scale of taxes, and those taxes are a special burden on Irish farmers as compared with English, or Scottish farmers, as the latter, first, are not owners, and, second, have not a saleable interest in their farms. The duty on transfers of land is doubled; whether the duty falls on the buyer or seller is immaterial because a farmer has to pay in all cases. I think I need say no more about that.<lb/>
I may mention incidentally that almost every public body in Ireland has passed resolutions against the Budget and calling upon your Lordships' House to throw it out. That is something from the point of view of a Unionist, as I am, to remember. I do not anticipate that there will be, as we have been asked to believe, a revolution or that the action of your Lordships' House is revolutionary. I may be singular in my opinions; but I think Mr. John Bull will eat his Christmas dinner and kiss his wife when the time comes, and spend as merry a Christmas as the times will allow. And when the time arrives he will proceed to indulge in a General Election. What the result of that will be none can tell. Many prophecies have been made, but I am not going to prophesy. Speaking for myself and my fellow countrymen I hope we shall go back to Ireland with a little Land Bill peeping out of our pockets. I wish I had the latest edition of it. I give my vote for this Amendment on the ground that it is clear and comprehensible and eminently suited to the circumstances in which your Lordships' House finds itself. We have been forced into it by the action of His Majesty's Government. I do not fear the result. I do not think noble Lords whom I have had the honour of addressing, and who have listened to me with patience, fear the result either.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03460"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Lord Weardale, in a speech which was full of vigour and enthusiasm, called attention to a point which I think was well worthy of notice. He pointed out that in the attack all down the line which has been made upon the Budget noble Lords, in their anxiety and eagerness to denounce the Budget from every point of view, seemed to have forgotten that there is such a person in existence as Mr. Arthur Balfour, and also
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0508"/>
<col>1003</col>
the fact that he is the recognised leader of the policy of His Majesty's Opposition. As far as we understand the responsible attitude of the Leader of the Opposition it is this&#x2014;he seems to have no very great objection to the Income Tax, the Super Tax, or the additional Death Duties. He thinks they are legitimate and irresistible, of course provided the financial difficulty is sufficient to justify them. And I think he takes credit&#x2014;and justly takes credit&#x2014;for the fact that in the Commons' House of Parliament there was latterly no serious opposition and no serious divisions taken against those Taxes. Very well; the objection on principle seems to be whittled down to the Liquor and the Land Taxes. As regards the Liquor Taxes I am not qualified to speak, and I shall not detain your Lordships one moment with them. They were ably explained and defended last night by noble Lords on this side of the House, and that leaves us solely and entirely with the land.<lb/>
Well, the attitude of noble Lords opposite is clear and distinct. We do not cavil and we do not quarrel with it. It seems to me they say to us, "If you put a sacrilegious hand on the land, that is Socialism pure and simple, which we mean to resist to the utmost of our power." As regards land, of course we know that land is divided into two sections. There is the urban land and the agricultural land. The question of the urban land was so well dealt with last night by Lord Pentland and Earl Beauchamp that it is unnecessary for me to detain your Lordships a single moment in going over any of the old ground again. May I say a few words&#x2014;I promise they will be very few&#x2014;simply on the question of agricultural land? It is with that the office I have the honour to hold is so closely connected. I will first deal with the burdens which speakers in the debate during the last three nights have alluded to as having been placed by the Budget on the agricultural industry.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be permitted to take as one instance the remarks of a member of Parliament whom everybody holds in the highest respect and esteem&#x2014;I mean Mr. Walter Long. Mr. Long, who is a fair, honourable, and upright political opponent, gave it as his deliberate opinion in the Commons' House of Parliament that the Budget was especially destructive to land, and that its general effect would be to
<col>1004</col>
depreciate land as a security. I do not think he is alone in that opinion. Noble Lords on the opposite side of the House have expressed the same opinion themselves. He gave several concrete instances of the difficulties under which landowners are at present placed, and thereby implied that it was very unfair to put any extra burdens upon people who were already in a very difficult and delicate condition. He gave a concrete instance. I will name two. He said that in an estate of &#x00A3;900 a year, the owner was extremely fortunate if he could get &#x00A3;400 to put into his pocket. In an estate of &#x00A3;10,000 a year the utmost that the owner could rely upon would be about &#x00A3;4,000. That is to say, the working expenses of management and the burdens on an agricultural estate would come to something like sixty per cent. of the gross income. And some other people have gone even further than that. A great authority on agricultural matters, Mr. Pretyman, and the Duke of Montrose, have gone so far as to say that the charges would come up to seventy-five, almost eighty per cent.; and ruinous balance sheets were published in the daily Press some time ago telling the same unfortunate and miserable tale. But I maintain&#x2014;and I think I can prove&#x2014;that though this may be the result of the management of estates in this country, as they are at present, it cannot possibly be considered that these returns are fair returns of the real value of land. I cannot help suspecting that noble Lords who are landowners are aware of this, and that may have something to do with the extreme and violent opposition to which has been subjected the Government proposal for the valuation of land at the expense of the State.<lb/>
May I take a concrete instance? I should like to refer to a book that was published in the year 1897 by the Duke of Bedford, and I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the Duke of Bedford is one of the best, if not the best, of all the good landlords in England. In his book, which he was rash enough to write, he calls attention to an estate called the Thorney Estate, in Cambridgeshire. It is some of the finest land in England&#x2014;land which was reclaimed when the great Bedford level was reclaimed by the Duke's great ancestor, the Earl of Bedford. It is practically about 23,000 acres&#x2014;one of the finest estates in England. There is no house on the estate, no mansion, no game;
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0509"/>
<col>1005</col>
there is no upkeep of gardens, or upkeep of any description. He described it as an estate which did not pay its way, which was a source of perpetual expense, and which was practically unsaleable, and <i>per se</i> insolvent on the points of income and expenditure. We have it from him that in 1895 there was a deficit; it brought in nothing&#x2014;23,000 acres of land brought in nothing, but there was a deficit of &#x00A3;441 upon it. Income Tax, which then was at 8<i>d</i>., we are told was paid on the estate, and that was &#x00A3;160 a year. In 1897, as your Lordships are aware, the country was fortunate enough to be governed by a glorious Conservative Government, and that Government lasted until 1905, when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Government came in. We have it on the authority of my noble friend Lord Onslow that, though agriculture was at its lowest ebb, so little notice was taken by the Conservative Government of the day that only six hours of the time of the House of Commons were devoted to agricultural questions. That was in six years. It was either five hours in six years or six hours in five years, I am not quite certain which. Evidently agriculture under a Conservative Government seemed almost so hopeless as to be hardly worth talking about. In 1905, ten years afterwards, the present Liberal Government came into power, and, as I had the honour of saying in this House some time ago, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman at once took up the land question in earnest.<lb/>
We have been in office now for four years, and in this, the fourth year, a Budget has been introduced which, if we are to believe one-hundredth part of what we are told, is going to bring the most utter ruin and distress on the country that the mind of man can possibly conceive A most amazing thing has happened. We have been in office, as I have said, four years. In this Budget year, in this disastrous year when securities were falling to nothing, when there was no confidence, when nobody would buy and when securities were going out as ballast to different countries; in this year of catastrophe and woe and sorrow a most amazing thing happened. The noble Duke put this unsaleable estate of Thorney into market. I bid for it at once on behalf of the Crown. I suppose I shall be told that is putting in the thin end of the wedge for the nationalisation of land. Well, I bid for that property at once. I was very courteously
<col>1006</col>
treated, but my offer was received with the contempt it deserved. In this year I had the estate valued by the Crown valuer. I offered for this unsaleable property the fair market value that was put upon it, and my offer was not listened to for one single moment. And that estate in this year of woe, that unsaleable estate, was sold for three-quarters of a million sterling. That is the most amazing thing that can possibly be conceived. Just think what that means! Three-quarters of a million sterling at four per cent. means &#x00A3;30,000 a year. This estate, which, under a Conservative Government, was unsaleable and produced a deficit of &#x00A3;441 a year, under a Liberal Government has been sold and brings in to its fortunate owner an increase of income of &#x00A3;30,000 a year. Everybody knows that the Income Tax at 1<i>s</i>. on three-quarters of a million is &#x00A3;1,500 a year, to that &#x00A3;1,500 a year Income Tax is paid on that unsaleable estate instead of &#x00A3;160 as it was in 1895. It of course goes to the payment of the Old Age Pensions and that line of battleships which everybody is of opinion is necessary for the defence of the country. Yet we are told in the face of this by Mr. Walter Long that the Budget has depreciated land as a security; and not only that, we have been told this afternoon by no less a person than an ex-Liberal Prime Minister of England that this Budget blocked up every channel of enterprise and has entirely destroyed the confidence of the country.<lb/>
I dare say I shall be told "Oh, this is another attack on the Dukes." It is nothing of the kind. It is simply a statement of fact. And it is not only in this individual instance that there is a rise in the value of land. Far from it, we all know that several very large estates have been sold lately. We all know that the value of land is rising and rents are rising. I was told by a friend of mine who has a large estate in Dorsetshire that if he had a farm to let now there were twenty applications for it, and farms let at &#x00A3;300 a year will fetch from &#x00A3;400 to &#x00A3;420 a year. There is a great demand for farms, and in Essex the value of land has advanced from twenty-five to forty per cent. in the last three years. I will give one instance, and one instance only. In 1904, 380 acres were bought for &#x00A3;3,600. The county council to-day have offered &#x00A3;6,000 for that land, and the offer has been refused. The county council wanted it for small holdings, and the owner asked &#x00A3;8,000. Probably it will go to arbitration,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0510"/>
<col>1007</col>
and some arrangement will be made, probably between the two prices.<lb/>
Then, as for land having gone down, look at the demand there is for land all over England as regards small holdings. This is all in your Lordships' knowledge. It shows that land is going up. I am perfectly certain that in a House the members of which we are told own from one-third to one-fifth of the land of England that is a very important thing for a Minister of Agriculture to be able to say. Over a million has been spent by county councils ill the last sixteen months in buying agricultural land, and rents are going up all round. Well, I suppose from the merriment these facts have been met with in this House noble Lords opposite think I am making Party capital out of this rise in land. I suppose they would say, "No doubt land is going up, but what has that to do with you; what on earth have you and your Government had to do with this rise in land?" I suppose it will be said, "We have had better seasons and there is general improvement all round." Better seasons&#x0021; I should like my friend Lord Onslow, when he meets the Farmers' Club next week, to say we have had better seasons. [Cries of 'Better prices."] We have had two bad harvests. The prices of sheep was never so low.</membercontribution></p>

That is out of the question. No sensible man would try to argue that. I don't want to put the thing too high in any way, but I do say&#x2014;and I am positive I am speaking the actual truth&#x2014;that there is more confidence in agricultural land and in farming all round on account of the land policy of His Majesty's Government. You deny it, but we do not take any credit for this. You must remember that nothing we can do in this House, nothing that those who sit on this side of the House can do, can be without the gracious permission of your Lordships' House, so that everything we do on this side of course is through your
<col>1008</col>
gracious permission. As men of honour and principle you surely would not, in the interests of the country, allow us to pass measures which you think detrimental to the good of the country.<lb/>
As I am challenged on this I am sure the House, which is always so good-natured to me, will allow me for a moment to state my case. Look at the Land Tenure Bill. It was entirely through your kindness we were enabled to get that Bill&#x2014;the Farmers' Charter Bill&#x2014;through. What does that give to the farmers? For the first time it gives the farmers security against eviction for religious, social, sporting or political reasons. Then, as regards small holdings, what have you allowed us to do? You have allowed us for the first time to have an impartial, practical, fair, and inexpensive Land Court for the determination of the rent and the price of land which is compulsorily acquired by local bodies, against which there is no appeal. That is an immense advance for good as we think, and it is entirely owing to your Lordships' permission that that great advance was allowed to be put on the Statute Book. Then as to the Housing Bill. I acknowledge your Lordships were not very much pleased with that Bill, but you have allowed it to pass. In it the same principle is allowed as regards rural houses; and the compulsory purchase of land has been recognised, in spite of the vigorous protest of a minority in Ireland.<lb/>
Perhaps your Lordships may think you have gone too far. Perhaps you think we want pulling up a bit, and that may be the object of what you are doing at the present moment. I must say you have temporarily knocked on the head the Development Grant I had the honour of introducing in this House, and you are knocking on the head the benefits to agriculture which would be secured by the Budget. But although Liberal legislation has been most severely handled by your Lordships' House as regards education and temperance and other matters, I have to offer my sincere and grateful thanks to noble Lords opposite for the way in which agricultural Bills have been treated. I have had the honour to introduce in this House fifteen Agricultural Bills, and fourteen of those Bills have been added to the Statute Book, and if it had not been for an unfortunate misunderstanding and interference I think I should have carried the Hops Bill through this House and the other
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0511"/>
<col>1009</col>
House as well, and then every single one of the Hills I had in three years introduced would have been passed into law.<lb/>
I hope I am not detaining the House too long. May I for one moment point out what the Budget does for agriculture, this Budget which is going to ruin it? There is no additional duty on earned incomes under &#x00A3;2,000 a year, and I should think there are very few of your Lordships' tenants who return profits at that sum. What have we done for your Lordships? Landlords' allowances are increased from twelve and a-half to twenty-five per cent., and that can be spent on repairs, insurance, management and maintenance. Maintenance, as your Lordships know, includes replacement, and replacement is a word in the Bill which means rebuilding farmhouses, cottages and buildings, putting up fences, &amp;c, and that is a direct incentive for landowners to rebuild the cottages on their estates and so to avoid patching up those miserable insanitary hovels which even under certain circumstances on the best and most generously managed estates, still unfortunately exist, and which are found to be so untenantable and so insanitary that they have to be pulled down by the order of the local authority. Well, there is the matter of the Super Tax&#x2014;&#x00A3;600,000; that goes to road improvement. There are the Death Duties. For the first time, under Clause 56, they can be paid in land. Instead of having to raise money on the estate you can pay in kind&#x2014;pay in land. Timber is only chargeable when sold. As regards the Land Taxes I need not take up one moment of your Lordships' time, because last night my noble friend Lord Beauchamp pointed out that none of those taxes apply to agricultural land at all. The relief of rates by the grant of half the Land Taxes and the Mineral Rights Duties amounts to a quarter of a million this year and probably would go on increasing.<lb/>
When the deficit was first discussed in public the whole of the Liberal Party, aye, and the Labour Party as well, were unanimous on one point. They said "If it is wrong to tax food&#x2014;and every single one of us agrees that it is a wicked and a cruel wrong to tax the food of the people&#x2014;it is equally wrong to tax the land that grows that food." The Chancellor of the Exchequer was determined on that point, the Cabinet was unanimous on that point, and therefore the Budget was drawn on
<col>1010</col>
lines as favourable as possible to the landlords, to the tenant farmers, and to the small holders. What did the Chancellor of the Exchequer say on the 9th of June to the agricultural industry? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I want &#x00A3;16,000,000 from you. I estimate to get by extra Death Duties &#x00A3;480,000; in extra Income Tax I estimate to get &#x00A3;280,000, and with the new Super Tax in addition &#x00A3;120,000. I think that you&#x2014;that is the agricultural interest&#x2014;ought to contribute to the new taxes &#x00A3;880,000, but <i>per contra</i>&#x2014;as the bankers say&#x2014;I shall relieve you by giving on the other hand a relief to the Road Tax&#x2014;that is for road improvements&#x2014;&#x00A3;600,000 and for the Agricultural Development Grant &#x00A3;250,000; so that if you deduct the &#x00A3;850,000 from &#x00A3;880,000 you will find the extra taxation you will have to pay practically as an interest is &#x00A3;30,000."</quote>
Well, but in the last days of June Mr. Lloyd-George went further, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"There are provisions in the Budget which will safeguard the agricultural interest, and I say if those provisions are not sufficiently strong I am prepared to accept any Amendment which will make that perfectly clear."</quote>
The House of Commons took him at his word&#x2014;a Liberal Minister's pledge is his word and bond&#x2014;and the land clauses were debated for thirty-five days in the House of Commons. There was no guillotine, and there was very little of the closure. This, I think, hardly bears out my noble friend Lord Rosebery's statement that measures were shot into this House with as little inquiry as possible. Both sides, the great Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, the agriculturists on both sides, gave every assistance, and on the 30th of September the following concessions were announced as the result of deliberations. Mr. Lloyd-George reduced the extra Death Duties from &#x00A3;480,000 to &#x00A3;450,000. He then wiped out at once the whole of the additional Income Tax of 2<i>d</i>. in the pound, which came, as you remember, to &#x00A3;280,000, by giving relief to agricultural landlords under Schedule A; and to such a liberal extent did he do this that when it works out it will be found that he positively gave the agricultural landlords of this country a bonus of &#x00A3;95,000 in addition. These are Treasury figures, absolutely correct. He also reduced the Super Tax from &#x00A3;120,000 to &#x00A3;78,000, and therefore your Lordships will see that the total reduction brings down the additional taxation on the agricultural interest for national purposes from &#x00A3;880,000, as it was in June, to &#x00A3;443,000.<lb/>
But this is not all. Your Lordships will remember that he promised to assist the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0512"/>
<col>1011</col>
agricultural interest by the Road Grant and the Development Grant&#x2014;that is, by &#x00A3;850,000. The agricultural interest at the present moment under the proposed Budget is to pay in extra taxes &#x00A3;443,000. Take &#x00A3;443,000 from &#x00A3;850,000 which is given by the Government, and the agricultural interest in this year comes out &#x00A3;407,000 on the right side, although we had to raise &#x00A3;16,000,000 for "Dreadnoughts" and Old Age Pensions. Yet we are told&#x2014;solemnly told by Mr. Walter Long, who no doubt believes every word he says, that the Budget is especially destructive to land and landed interest&#x0021; I leave the case there. I have nothing more to say, good or indifferent. I leave the case there for the public to judge it on its merits. These figures are Treasury figures. They cannot be shaken, and they are perfectly accurate.<lb/>
In conclusion I should like to say I can perfectly understand&#x2014;anybody can perfectly understand&#x2014;the objection to this vindictive Budget, as you may like to call it, of the vested interests, of the millionaires, of the brewers, of the urban landlords, and of the mine owners. A tax is disagreeable to everybody, and I can quite understand that even vested interests object to these taxes, and will do everything they possibly can to put the burden on other shoulders. But when the agricultural interest and the farmers realise the position that is being thrown away by the rejection of this Budget; when they realise this position&#x2014;and the farmers are a hard-headed lot of men&#x2014;they will not allow themselves to be led away by the unreasonable fears and sophistries of Mr. Long and his friends. They will see with us that our proposals in the Budget&#x2014;all the proposals in the Budget&#x2014;are just and fair, and especially just and fair towards the great national industry which I have the honour to represent. And I feel certain that the agricultural industry will not support noble Lords opposite, when it knows the real state of the case, in your attempt, by destroying the people's Budget, to precipitate a national crisis the gravity of which it is impossible to over-estimate, and the consequences of which it is impossible to foretell or to foresee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03464"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are always delighted with the breezy optimism of the President of the Board of Agriculture, not the less because that optimism takes the form of a confident
<col>1012</col>
belief in the omnipotent powers for good of the Liberal Party and of the Liberal Government. The noble Earl has produced figures to your Lordships by which he has striven to show that the result of the Budget would be relief to the landowners. He has told your Lordships that the value of land was advancing by leaps and bounds, notwithstanding the fact that the harvest has not been particularly good. One or two of my noble friends asked him whether he had any information as to the effect of prices upon the value of land, but the noble Earl did not tell us how far it was the effect of the undoubted rise in the price of agricultural produce. He was content to say that he had passed fourteen out of fifteen Bills that he had introduced to Parliament, and he seemed to rest upon that foundation the increasing prosperity of agriculture. I remember some years ago when Her late Majesty Queen Victoria took part in a review of the troops on their return from the Egyptian Campaign, there was an exceptionally dense fog, but just as Her Majesty drove up to the saluting point the fog lifted in a marvellous manner, and everybody said it was due to the exertions of the Liberal Government. The noble Lord has paid the compliment to noble Lords sitting on this side of the House that we have assisted him by piloting his measures through Parliament. I think there was a vein of irony running through his remarks; they sounded like the sentiments of those careful people who do not attribute everything to themselves, but who remark, when anything happens to their satisfaction, that it was through the mercy of Providence and the oversight of the devil. The noble Lord produced some figures by which he hoped to show that the result of the Budget would be a relief to the landowners of this country. I am at a loss to see how that is to be the result, if that particular form of investment has to pay Income Tax, possibly Super Tax, increased Death Duties, increased Succession Duties, Increment Value, Undeveloped Land Duty, and Reversion Duty. It seems to me impossible to see how, under those circumstances, the Budget is going to be a relief.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03466"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: The landlords of this country are the owners of land of different kinds and will all have to bear these taxes or some of them. It is
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0513"/>
<col>1013</col>
no answer to say because there are no extra burdens put on agricultural land that landowners as a class will not have to bear additional burdens. Of course they will. Is it not reasonable to suppose that if there are opportunities of transferring the burden from landlords to tenants an endeavour will be made to do so? Those who will feel the burden more than any others in the course of a very short time would be the tenant farmers and small holders in whom the noble Earl is so greatly interested. He said nothing about the valuation proposals contained in the Budget. If there is to be no taxation levied upon agricultural land, why in the name of fortune should the Government want to have it valued at all? I want to know why it should not be quite sufficient for the purposes of the Government that a declaration should be made by a land owner that his land is agricultural land not exceeding &#x00A3;50 an acre in value, and that he should then enjoy exemption from valuation. This valuation will be a very severe and onerous tax. The Government now propose that the valuation should be made by Government valuers. But these young gentlemen receiving &#x00A3;500 a year will not have their valuations accepted by every landowner. It will be necessary to employ other valuers to test the decisions arrived at by the government valuers. I will not pursue further the question of the land taxes because the hour is late, and it is a subject with which many are more competent to deal than myself.<lb/>
I should like to refer to another aspect of the question&#x2014;I mean the constitutional aspect. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack commands the respect and admiration of all members of this House, and therefore I am very glad that we are able to accept wholly and unreservedly the declaration he made on the first evening of the debate. The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, said that the noble and learned Lord had on a previous occasion declared that this House had a perfect right to reject a Money Bill. If I heard the noble and learned Lord aright it was exactly what he repeated on the opening night, but he accompanied it by a further declaration that we must look also, and even more, to custom, usage, and convention. Lord Rosebery has said that we are governed more in this country by custom than by law. That is perfectly true, but who was the first to break through
<col>1014</col>
this custom which has been hitherto honourably observed? I venture to say it was the Government. Custom forbade your Lordships to alter a Money Bill, but it also forbade the House of Commons to put into a Money Bill anything but the provisions for the current expenditure of the year. But what has happened this year? The Government have put into the Finance Bill a Valuation Bill, which is not going to bring in any revenue, and a Licensing Bill, or, at any rate, vindictive legislation, which has for its object the extermination of the publican. If one party therefore, breaks through a well-understood practice I do not think it lies in their mouths to make complaint when the noble Marquess asks your Lordships to differ from the procedure which has been followed in former years.<lb/>
Now what is the issue that lies before us? It is not a question affecting the interpretation of the Constitution, neither is it whether indirect taxation should be substituted for direct taxation. The issue really amounts to a challenge on the part of noble Lords opposite that this House has no right to determine when there shall be a General Election. This has been said on several previous occasions. It was said when your Lordships threw out the Education Bill, but we have it on the authority of one of the leaders of the Nonconformist party&#x2014;Sir Robert Perks&#x2014;that they never wanted that Bill, and that it was perfectly distasteful to them. No General Election took place at our dictation then. Your Lordships also threw out the Licensing Bill. That Bill may have died either in Berkeley-square or in this House, but it died "unwept, unhonoured, and unsung," and it cannot be said that your Lordships dictated a General Election then. Now this Finance Bill embodies the principle of both of those measures, in addition to the Supplies of the year. The duty of this House is a very delicate and a very difficult one. A General Election takes place but very seldom, and it is difficult to know what the country thinks of many measures put before it by the Government. Your Lordships are rather in the position of thought-readers. You have to judge as best you can whether the country is in sympathy or not with the measures placed before this House. I do not believe for a moment that the country was in sympathy with the Government either in respect of the Licensing or Education
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0514"/>
<col>1015</col>
Bills. Why did not they put it to the test? The test was applied in 1895 when your Lordships rejected the Home Rule Bill, and on that occasion your Lordships proved to be very accurate thought-readers and to have accurately interpreted the opinion of the country.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite used language which I will not describe as minatory, but it was calculated to cause you to pause before taking a step further. We have been told that things cannot be as they were, and that no quarter will be given. The Secretary for Scotland yesterday said that there was a raging, tearing propaganda in the country. My Lords, there is a raging, tearing propaganda going on in the country against your Lordships' House. But what is the penalty to be meted out which may be "altogether disproportionate to our offence?" Is it that there will be a reform of this House? We have had a Committee sitting which agreed that reform was desirable. Is it that there should be some Referendum to the people other than that of a General Election? Lord Rosebery has said that he, for one, would welcome some such proposition. The Committee expressed regret that it was not within the terms of their reference. Or is it a proposal that there shall be but one Chamber and that the Second Chamber shall be swept away altogether? If that is the proposal noble Lords opposite are going to put before the country, I hope they will present it without delay, for I am satisfied that, whatever may be the views of this country about the Budget or the constitution of your Lordships' House, there cannot be two opinions that this country will not stand a single Chamber. The proposal made by the late Prime Minister really amounted to a claim that, however old a Parliament may be, it must represent in all things the will of the people. That is a preposterous position to take up. It is not the view of the great Statesmen of the past. Burke said "the virtue, spirit, and essence of the House of Commons consisted in its being the express image of the nation." Was the House of Commons of 1895 the "express image of the nation"? I think not. The intention of that resolution is that when once a General Election is over the interests of the country are to be handed over to the Ministers for the time being and no control is to be held over them by another House of Parliament.<lb/>
I am not one of those who minimise
<col>1016</col>
the gravity of the step to be taken in throwing out this Finance Bill, but I venture to say that that step is not so grave a one as would be the demand that in a Finance Bill may be embodied matters which are not concerned with the provision of Supplies necessary for the year. This House does not set up any claim to control the <i>personnel</i> of the Ministry of the Crown. It does not initiate and it does not claim to alter Finance Bills. But it does claim to stand between the people and rash and vast changes, whether made under cover of a Finance Bill or in any other way&#x2014;changes that may destroy the slowly-built-up fabric of our national credit, which may drive the accumulated savings of the people to other lands to provide employment for foreigners instead of for Englishmen, and which are designed to establish a system of land nationalisation that may corrupt the whole system of Government and debase the people by making them dependent on those whom they have elected, instead of upon energy and enterprise. It is because we feel that no other course is open to us that most of those sitting on this side of the House will give our vote for the Amendment of the noble Marquess; and we believe that we shall receive the support of the country in maintaining the right of this House to oppose changes which we believe to be detrimental to the country, until such time as the people shall, if they so will, endorse the action of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03467"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GLANTAWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this question is such an important one that it cannot be treated too lightly, and I will venture to detain your Lordships for a few minutes even at this late hour. This Bill bristles with a number of obligations in the shape of new taxes. Taxes at all times are very objectionable, for whatever purpose they are needed. The great need in this instance has been the large expenditure made on the Navy and the enormous expense we have incurred in Old Age Pensions. Our expenses are increasing very rapidly year by year. They are stated this year at 165 millions, and the estimated revenue at 148 millions, which means that there is a deficit of about seventeen millions to be met. When we enter into these obligations the next duty that faces us is to provide funds with which to meet them, and to my mind the manner in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has met them is a perfectly fair one.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0515"/>
<col>1017</col>
Old age pensions are popular on both sides of the House. The necessity of making provision for the aged poor has been discussed in the country for a number of years. It was advocated by Mr. Chamberlain, whose absence from the other House we all deplore, and especially the cause of it; he was about the first to introduce this great question, but following upon that he introduced the question of Tariff Reform. Tariff Reform, according to Mr. Chamberlain's view, is the only remedy by which the country can meet all the obligations they have incurred. That question at the time created a great sensation on account of the personality of the man who brought it forward. Had it been advocated by any less notable person than Mr. Chamberlain the country as a whole would have pooh-poohed it. The best definition of Mr. Chamberlain's policy is, I think, given in the <i>Daily Mail Year Book</i> for 1907, and there it is given in a short space. Mr. Chamberlain endeavoured to show that from his point of view the duties he proposed to impose were such as would not cause inconvenience to any sections of the community, yet on the whole they would not affect the working classes more than to the extent of 2<i>d</i>. per annum. The question was fully discussed throughout the country, and Mr. Chamberlain, as you are aware, made very able speeches; he selected certain trades and illustrated them as dying trades, and as trades that would be driven to other countries because other countries levied heavy duties upon our produce and dumped their materials into this country to our detriment free of duty. As a matter of fact, almost every industry pointed out by Mr. Chamberlain as a dying industry revived as soon as it was so selected. Then there is another remarkable little table given in the book to which I have referred, and I should like to call the attention of your Lordships to it. It shows that in the twenty years from 1880 to 1900 the cost of food fell from 120 to 101, and the cost of clothing fell from 168 to 98. On the other hand, rent in London rose from eighty-seven to 100 per cent.; rent in other large towns increased from eighty-five to 100 per cent., and rent in Great Britain, excluding London, rose from seventy-nine to 100 per cent. These items show that the advantages derived from cheap food were counterbalanced by the great increase in rent. I have quoted these figures because the <i>Daily Mail</i> has been a strong advocate of Tariff Reform throughout.<lb/>
<col>1018</col>
In the excellent debates we have had on the Finance Bill it is to be noted that those who object to the taxes do not suggest how the revenue is to be increased so as to meet the obligations. We have been told that Tariff Reform is the only alternative. I have been a Free Trader ever since I understood anything of Free trade. I have followed this question very closely, and have given a great deal of time to it. I have tried to look at it from an impartial point of view, especially when strong cases are made out that some industries are affected by the dumping on these shores of materials from other countres at a cheaper rate than we can produce them. Tariff Reformers tell us that it is not their intention to levy a tax on raw material. But we have to recognise that what is a manufactured article in one particular instance would be a raw material for other purposes. There is no country in the world that dumps so large a quantity of goods as we do, because we are a manufacturing nation, and without demands from other nations for goods, either of a raw or manufactured nature, it would be impossible for us to carry on our manufactures and give employment to the people in the way we do at present.<lb/>
We are frequently referred to America and Germany. It is well known that the number of unemployed in both of those countries has been far greater than in this country, and that the cost of living in both countries is very much higher. I have had several letters from persons who were in my employ before they went to America, imploring me to advance the money to let them return to the Old Country. During the last two years in America the number of men out of employment has been between fifty and seventy-five per cent. greater than in this country. Trade, however, is reviving there now. The financial disturbances which occurred two years ago were of a very far-reaching nature, their ramifications seriously affected every European nation; they affected American trade very much more seriously than anything has affected trade in our country. I feel confident that we should not derive benefit if we adopted Tariff Reform; this country has been so prosperous during the last fifty years under Free Trade that I think the adoption of Tariff Reform would be most detrimental and dangerous.<lb/>
Leaving that on one side, I have noticed since the present Government came into power the great difficulty of passing Bills
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0516"/>
<col>1019</col>
through your Lordships' House. Whatever has been proposed has been criticised, frequently unduly, from a purely Party point of view, and not upon its merits. Take, for instance, many of the remarks made in this debate. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has endeavoured to meet the wishes of a large number of deputations that have waited upon him representing the different trades of the country, and especially the agricultural interest, and they have been met in such a way that now the Chancellor of the Exchequer is charged with having brought in a Bill that he had not fully considered. He has made concessions in order to meet the requirements of the different trades. I have given the question close attention, and the proposals are such as I can very heartily endorse. I have attended some of the meetings of bankers in the City where very strong views have been expressed upon certain questions, especially with regard to the Stamp Duties. These duties have been modified in such a way that I think now they may be considered in every respect satisfactory.<lb/>
I was very glad to hear the strong speech made by my noble friend Lord St. David's, who has had a large experience of the employment of capital in foreign countries and has been largely connected with the shipping trade. We have nothing to fear in this Budget from the transfer of British capital to other countries. No money will be driven away unless it can be proved that investors will get a better return. I listened with close attention to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech when he introduced his Budget. I did not quite agree with some of the proposals put forward at that time, especially with regard to the tax upon ungotten minerals. I think the tax that is now put upon minerals is a fair one. Some mineral property owners act very fairly towards their lessees, but there are others who do not meet their lessees as they should do. I was sorry to hear the uncomplimentary references that have been made about Dukes. We have a Duke in our neighbourhood who owns a large mineral property. I have had to do with him both in buying land for public purposes, and also in my private capacity. I must give him and his agents the credit for having met every case in a most liberal and business-like manner. There was a large colliery in the neighbourhood owned by the Duke of Beaufort, and those who took the colliery spent a large amount
<col>1020</col>
of money upon it. The colliery was unremunerative for a number of years, and the royalty was 9<i>d</i>. per ton. Representations were made to the agent, and the Duke of Beaufort very generously reduced the royalty to one-half, and from that time the colliery has been successful and has given employment to a large number of people. That is an example by a noble Duke which many other lessors of minerals might well follow.<lb/>
The tax on royalties is a very small one, and I think it ought to have been very much larger, especially when we consider that when a colliery is sunk in a district the value of the surface land, which was not previously worth more than 5<i>s</i>. or 6<i>s</i>. per acre, is advanced at once to &#x00A3;4 or &#x00A3;5 per acre. The royalty owner contributes nothing to the rates and taxes of the district but pockets all the profits, and the only contribution he at present makes is to the Income Tax. On the other hand, the lessees and the men who work in the collieries have to build their own houses; they have to pay a very high ground rent; they spend money on building cottages; they have short leases; they have to effect sanitary reforms, and to go to the cost of getting water to supply their houses; and at the end the landlord has the full benefit of the whole expenditure and the poor lessees are sent empty away. To my mind that is iniquitous. I think that the amount now claimed from the royalty owner is a small one, and I cannot help thinking that when the principle is debated you must put it under the head of what is frequently termed "the thin end of the wedge." I have no doubt that at present the amount charged on royalties is small, and not fair to those who work the minerals. I had intended to refer to other questions of great importance, but many of them have been debated. Therefore, I will not delay your Lordships longer but will conclude by saying that I support the Budget most heartily.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03488">Debate on the Amendment moved by the Marquess of Lansdowne to the Motion that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup> <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03489"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret very much that indisposition prevents my noble friend Lord Curzon being here this afternoon to continue the debate, but I hope he will have an opportunity of speaking before the debate closes. It is impossible to overstate the importance as well as the great interest of this debate. It is manifest to any one who has followed its course that every speaker who has hitherto addressed the House has been deeply impressed with the sense of his responsibility. Certain things have become perfectly plain. I have not found in any part of the House a serious effort made to question the absolute right of your Lordships to proceed to vote for the Amendment moved by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. No one who is alive to the Parliamentary and political history of the country has questioned the impropriety of an effort to overpower your Lordships by the process called "tacking" Bills. The quotations made by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition were amply sufficient to prove the constitutional propriety of his action and of his objections to tacking, but they were only a selection from the consensus of opinion among all great lawyers and all great Statesmen. You cannot find a single leading writer on the political history of England that does not readily admit what cannot be challenged&#x2014;the clear right of this House to act as in its discretion it may think right in reference to the rejection of a Budget Bill, and also the clear right of this House not to have its judgment interfered with by the process known as "tacking" on other Bills.<lb/>
The only effort I have heard made in this debate to question these most obvious facts was made, or partly made, by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, but he did not seek to question what had been said by Lord Spencer and Lord Ripon a few years ago. He did not call in question a single word of those statements. All he said was that he admitted the technical right of this House, but that it was unconstitutional to reject the Budget; and when my noble friend Lord Salisbury, in his most interesting speech, gave a quotation from a speech of the noble
<col>1024</col>
and learned Lord which appeared in its terms entirely to admit the contention, the noble and learned Lord said that that sentence must not be taken in connection with the wider proposition, but was to be narrowed down and confined solely to the particular Bill of which he was speaking. Be it so. I have too great a respect for my noble and learned friend not to accept readily any reason he gives for any sentence he may use, but I must say that I do not understand what he means by saying this Amendment is unconstitutional unless, as my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury pointed out, it is a phrase that is used to cover the impossibility of finding any other convenient word.<lb/>
What is meant by saying that it is unconstitutional? I do not know. It is a commonplace in our Constitution that this House has the right contended for. Is not the non-exercise of this power in itself a proof of the moderation, the prudence, the caution, the forbearance with which this House acts in reference to its strict powers? I use it as a proof that this House is ever jealous to recognise and support the privileges of the House of Commons. I had the honour of sitting for many years in the other House and would be the last to say a word in disparagement of its privileges, indeed this House has uniformly shown a desire not to run counter to but to assent to those privileges. But this Bill is an absolutely new departure, the like of which is not to be found in any previous Budget&#x2014;it is an absolutely new departure in the history of Budgets, and in its purposes and in its attempted policies it far transcends the scope of any ordinary Budget. It presents a variety of Bills tacked on to a Finance Bill, whose sole purpose should be the provision of revenue for the year. This Bill seeks to go far outside that scope and object. The obligation is before the Government of finding means to meet the needs which have been accumulating within the last year, and if ever there was an occasion when it would have been wise, in view of those needs, to keep to constitutional lines that would not challenge dissent, that occasion was this year. This is not a pure and simple Budget; it is nothing of the kind. I am not going to weary your Lordships by attempting to wade through the intricacies of this complicated and strange production. I shall confine myself to a few plain topics.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0519"/>
<col>1025</col>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;a man of great ability, of some humour, and with great power of statement&#x2014;said that there was never a Budget framed more deliberately. I am prepared to believe that if it gives pleasure to anybody. Certainly there never was a Budget which had been changed more violently and more rapidly. There never was a scheme of finance so deliberately framed and so deliberately abandoned. When he came to unfold his views on the Land Clauses the Chancellor of the Exchequer appeared to have an attack of Dukes on the brain. He could see and think of nothing but Dukes. There are not a great many Dukes. To look at they are not very unlike other men. Some of them are rich, some of them are not at all so rich, and why it should give special pleasure to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to go out of his way to drag a Duke into every clause and every speech passes my comprehension. The Undeveloped Land Tax&#x2014;a very ambitious and far-reaching tax&#x2014;does not primarily affect Dukes, or millionaires, or great landowners. They are not a numerous class, but there are hundreds of thousands of small proprietors, and it would have been reasonable in considering taxation to remember that you may be making a tremendous onslaught upon those who can ill afford any additions to their burdens. Would it not have been wise to insert in that clause some words of protection and reasonable consideration for the building and kindred trades? Would it not have been well to bear in mind what we see at the street corners in London&#x2014;the large numbers of unemployed&#x2014;and to realise that thousands of workmen have been cast out of employment by the wreck of the building trade owing to this Budget? How the inclusion of such a tax in an ordinary Budget can be defended I cannot understand.<lb/>
Nor can I understand the inclusion in a Bill intended to provide for the finance of the year of a proposal for setting up all over England a scheme of valuation which is to last for all time at an expense which transcends for the year all the gain that is to come out of it. I was greatly struck some time ago in reading the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>, a very able and much respected Liberal journal, to find the statement that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Budget must not order land to be valued which it does not propose to tax. It is hopeless
<col>1026</col>
to expect to get a final and complete system of valuation out of a Budget for one year."</quote>
To graft that proposal on to a Finance Bill is "tacking" of the grossest kind, to which this House has uniformly objected. It was sought to be done, as my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, in a separate Bill but a short time ago, and that Bill having failed to pass, it is now attempted to graft a great new separate department upon the bureaucracy of the nation, and to do it under cover of a Finance Bill. This, as I have said, is "tacking" of the gravest kind. The same remark may be made in reference to the extraordinary Licence Duties. The licensing question was sought to be dealt with in a Bill last year. That Bill gave great dissatisfaction. The Bill did not pass. But now the Bill has reappeared in practically a worse form in the Budget. That, again, is an example of the unconstitutional practice of "tacking." It is impossible to defend it. In the other House it was charged to be either an act of revenge or an effort to please extreme temperance reformers. If the Government go outside the ordinary methods of a Budget Bill, then they provoke and challenge criticism.<lb/>
I had the honour of sitting in the House of Commons with Mr. Gladstone, as had also the noble Viscount opposite, Lord Morley. In common with other of his opponents I always had the greatest respect for his commanding powers of speech and his great statesmanship, and I read a quotation that greatly struck me in a paper recently from a speech by Mr. Gladstone in 1861. Mr. Gladstone said on that occasion&#x2014;
<quote>"If the House of Commons attempted to abuse the finance forms for legislative purposes, the Peers might find it wise and just to fall back upon an assertion of the whole breadth of their privileges."</quote>
Can any one doubt that Mr. Gladstone would never have been a party to this Budget? I do not believe he would have listened to a single proposition in it. He was a very great Chancellor of the Exchequer, he was a great master of figures and finance, but he was also a great purist as to Budget Bills, and you cannot point to a single financial speech made by Mr. Gladstone or a single Budget for which he was responsible either as Chancellor of the Exchequer or Prime Minister that did not keep within
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0520"/>
<col>1027</col>
lines that were perfectly capable of defence. It shows, had Mr. Gladstone been a Peer in this House, the kind of criticism he would have passed on those financiers who have so terribly fallen away from the pure lessons of honourable finance. Mr. Haldane, the Secretary of State for War, a man whom it is impossible not to speak of at all events with seriousness, and whose military position no doubt caused him to recognise that caution was required, said lately, in reference to what is expected to take place, that the Government may have a great victory but may have a great defeat. I was amused to see that the right hon. gentleman called on his numerous friends at a luncheon to act as the stern Romans acted when Hannibal was almost at the gates of Rome. Whether he meant to convey that the noble Marquess who moved this Amendment was in the position of that Great General or not I do not know, but whereas Hannibal did not have many friends within the lines of his opponents, I am very sure that the noble Marquess has many hearty well-wishers within the ranks of the supporters of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
I have not heard every speech delivered in this debate, but I have had the pleasure of listening to a great many. I do not think that any speeches that I have heard for a long time in your Lordships' House have so impressed me as those of Lord Revelstoke, Lord Avebury, and Lord Milner. I do not profess great acquaintance with the topic they discussed, but it was impossible for anybody not to be tremendously influenced by what they said. They are all men of great ability, great power of expression, vast experience, and immense knowledge of the topic, and they all spoke each from his own point of view of the feeling of unrest and insecurity which has everywhere been caused by this Budget. Consols have fallen; prices have tumbled down; a deadly blow has been given to trade and commerce, and there has been a flight of millions&#x2014;an appalling number of millions sterling&#x2014;from England to a more secure haven in other parts of the world. That is an immense fact. The Prime Minister said, with apparently a light heart&#x2014;although a man sometimes uses light words when his heart is heavy enough&#x2014;
<quote>"We have Bent millions of British capital to the uttermost parts of the earth."</quote>
<col>1028</col>
I suppose he thought that was a thing that could be accepted and cheered. What does it mean? British capital has gone to the uttermost parts of the earth, with great advantage, I have no doubt, to the development of civilization and to make legitimate profit. If it went there for an honest and legitimate purpose, it is well; but if it went there because it had no security at home, if it was compelled to go abroad to find a safe outlet, that is a matter full of grave importance to which we should give very serious thought.<lb/>
I cannot close my remarks without a reference to the country to which I belong. The Irish are very clever, very intelligent, and generally know where their interests are. I do not believe that there is a man, woman, or child in Ireland at the present minute in favour of this Budget. My noble friend Lord Donoughmore the other night, in a closely-reasoned and admirable speech, showed that in a way which left no possible room for doubt. Is not that a circumstance that should be borne in mind? I do not think that you will find any great enthusiasm for it in England, in Scotland, or even in Wales, except perhaps out of a sense of personal loyalty to a Welsh Chancellor of the Exchequer; but speaking for Ireland, which is well informed as to its own interests and wants, I do not believe that any one is in favour of it. It is my pleasure to read Irish newspapers, not always of my own way of thinking, and I read in nearly every one of them now resolutions of different public bodies, all of whom are against the Budget and deploring that their Members had not acted more as they wished them to act in distinctly opposing it. That is a circumstance I do not dwell upon, but I think it is one that should not be lost sight of.<lb/>
I quite admit that wealth should bear its full share in meeting the national wants. No one questions that. It is quite right that those who are wealthy should pay a much larger proportion of taxes to meet the needs of the nation than those who are much poorer. No one denies that. I know a good many rich men, and have never heard any of them express any dissatisfaction at having to bear their legitimate burden. There is, however, reason in everything. The moment that you admit the train of reasoning that you have only to rob
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0521"/>
<col>1029</col>
the rich to relieve the poor it is quite possible that you may drive millions away from the country by your action, but, if you do so, you will necessarily increase the unemployed by thousands. It is easy enough by means of a Budget Bill to take capital from the capitalists of your own country and to apply it when levied as taxes as part of the income of the nation. But is that business? This is not a Budget pure and simple. It embodies many Bills and many programmes, and the House of Lords has a light to be sure that the nation knows that it is an entirely new departure. Would your Lordsips be justified in giving assent to this strange production without being sure that it was accompanied by the sanction of the nation?<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, yesterday made a speech such as we have heard him make before. It was able, forcible, and witty, particularly at the beginning and in the middle. He denounced in a way that none of us on this Bench could have done every item in the Budget. Our language is chaste to moderation compared with what he said of it. He had not a good word to say about any part of it. As to its framers, I will not say he denounced them, but I think he uttered a silent prayer and thanked God he was not like any of them. There was nothing very new in the early part of the noble Earl's speech. He had said a great deal of it before in Glasgow and he had prepared us for his Glasgow speech by a letter in which he denounced the whole Budget as a revolution. Then he made the Glasgow speech. He could not go much stronger. He stuck to the word "revolutionary," proving it up to the hilt, and he said last night that he adhered to every word of the Glasgow speech. I had the pleasure of reading the Glasgow speech. I did so with great interest, because it is always pleasant to read a vigorous&#x2014;shall I say?&#x2014;onslaught, or a free, conscientious denunciation of your political opponents; and I gathered from reading that speech, being only a plain, ordinary man, that the noble Earl earnestly hoped&#x2014;he did not say he would lead the charge&#x2014;that there would be brave and true men in the country who would do their best to throw out this Budget. Yesterday, not having said a word in advance indicating that he had receded from the Glasgow speech, and saying, indeed, that he did not recede from
<col>1030</col>
it, when he came to apply it we were not so clear as to the clearness of his mind. The conclusion was not at all the same as the beginning or the middle of his speech. At the close he did not like the Budget or its framers a bit more. He still thought the Budget revolutionary, but he was not absolutely sure if he were in the position of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition that he would not for this occasion only pass the Bill and wait for a better occasion to try his hand. As an ordinary man I do not think that that was a solution that gave great guidance to those who were listening. If it is an unprecedented Budget like the Budget we have before us; if it is revolutionary; if it contains all the bad taxes that this Budget does, one would have thought that the logical consequence was that with this unwonted, abnormal, unclean thing, violating in "tacking" every constitutional principle over and over again, before it now, if the House of Lords was ever to act, he would have supported a motion as prudent and as wise as that of my noble friend, and would have declined to be responsible for the passing of the Bill until satisfied that assent was given to it by the people.<lb/>
If the House of Lords is prepared in silence to pass this Budget, so unusual in its conception, so enormously out of harmony with all previous action, so opposed to every Budget that Mr. Gladstone framed, so startling in its possibilities, so far-reaching in its intentions, surely people would ask, What is the use of the House of Lords having the strongest opinions about a Bill if, when the time comes for action, it does nothing? What are we waiting for? If the House of Lords does not act now, will it ever act? I am as much impressed as any one with the magnitude of the issues. I feel as much as any one the seriousness of the debate in which we are engaged, and I feel the great responsibility which rests on every member of your Lordships' House. Every one in going through life has to face and assume, and not shrink and run away from, responsibilities. If you feel that you have something before you which should not be presented as it has been; if you entertain a strong vigorous judgment in reference to it; if you feel that it is opposed to all principle and to all precedent, that according to your light and your conscience you would not be justified
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0522"/>
<col>1031</col>
in passing it without the sanction of the nation, surely, my Lords, that is hardly the time to wait for something worse in order that you may then begin to do your duty. I concur with the Amendment of my noble friend the noble Marquess, and I ask myself whether, in Mr. Gladstone's words, the occasion has not arisen for a wise and just falling back upon the assertion of the whole breadth of our privileges.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03490"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will agree with the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down in regretting the absence of Lord Curzon from the House to-day, and no one more heartily wishes than I do that he may be able to be present early next week to take that distinguished part in the debates in this Chamber which he has done already on many previous occasions. I also find myself in agreement with the noble and learned Lord as to the importance of the subject which we are discussing to-night and in the fact that the issues with which we have to deal are very complicated, for they concern not only the merits of the legislative proposals of the Government but touch also the constitutional powers of this House. But I am not able to find myself in concurrence with him as to the practical wisdom of the course which is recommended.<lb/>
I agree with the noble and learned Lord that in many respects this Finance Bill is an unfair one. I think, with him, that it introduces novel principles, and introduces them in not altogether a fair way. I agree with him that the Government have not much reason to congratulate themselves either as to the form in which it is presented to us, the history of their proposals, or their method of dealing with the problems which they have raised. There have been, since this so-called "well-prepared" Budget first saw the light, many changes of front, neither small nor unimportant. Of the first 700 lines of the Bill, I believe 530 have been altered. There were originally seventy-four clauses, and some twenty-three more have been added which contain something like 5,000 words more. It will not do for the noble Lord opposite (Lord St. David's), who spoke last night, to say that all these changes were made as concessions to the opponents of the Government. They were made on account of the fact that many of the proposals that were in the Bill when it was first introduced could not stand criticism. They were bound to die in the light
<col>1032</col>
of the common-sense of those who had their attention attracted to them. This is true as regards proposals concerning minerals, as regards the exemption of agricultural land from the increment duty, and many of the exemptions of dwelling-houses.<lb/>
The most striking changes of front have been made with regard to valuation, with regard to the substitution of a tax on mineral royalties for a tax on ungotten minerals, and also as regards agricultural land. The Government are fond of taking credit to themselves that agricultural land is to escape the additional burdens imposed by this Bill. I think the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture was very clear on that point last night. Looking at the provisions of the Bill, I think it is a fact that the increment tax would not be laid on agricultural land as we generally know it, and I admit also that there are some concessions to the owners of agricultural land in the Bill. But very little account is taken of the severity of the burden which agricultural land is bearing at the present time. It bears an enormous proportion of the burden of local administration, and, in addition, there are six matters in which the burden on agricultural land will be increased by this Bill if it passes. There will be the Increment Value Duty at the rate of twenty per cent. on the difference between the value of the land on April 30, 1909, and when it comes to be sold. There is the difference between the original site value and the reversionary value of leases. There is the Undeveloped Land Duty, where it applies, on capital site value. There will be the Mineral Rights Duty, which, if not absolutely a tax on agricultural land is on the owners of that class of property. There will be the increased Death Duties, which apply all round, and there will be increased Stamp Duties on the conveyance of leases, an increase of about 100 per cent., except on conveyances where the consideration is not over &#x00A3;500.<lb/>
Another objection which I entertain to this Bill is that it levies taxes which are not necessary for the service of the year, and it does not seem to me to be any answer to say that the State will be put in possession of funds for future expenditure. In my humble opinion, this aggravates the change that is made, because it tends to make the Executive more and more independent of the control of Parliament. If I object to some of the contents of this Bill, I object still more to
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0523"/>
<col>1033</col>
the tone and temper of some of the speeches by which it has been recommended. I have no great experience of elections but I am led to believe that the use of rotten eggs in their coarser form is largely being abandoned. But there seems to me a considerable increase in the output of what I shall venture to describe as rhetorical rotten eggs, and I do not think they add either to tile amenity or to the interest of public life.<lb/>
We are asked, for the first time, to look at the origin of property. We are asked almost in the very words, to levy a fine on those who are wicked enough to possess land of any kind. In some cases credit is taken for not confiscating the whole of what is described as national property, and I venture to say that the arguments used in support of these propositions are such as to strike at the security of property and the principle of private ownership in land. I frankly admit that the Government are not responsible for the wild exaggerations of all their supporters, but some of themselves are not free from blame in this matter. I ventured some weeks ago to bring to the notice of the House, to the notice of those who sit on the Government Bench opposite, the sort of arguments which are used by the Lord Advocate in the country. I called attention to the fact that he said that&#x2014;
<quote>"these taxes involve a principle capable of far-reaching application. What was that principle? it was this, that the land of the country, the land, that is, distinct from the buildings erected on it, the land distinct from the improvements made upon it, in truth belongs to the nation."</quote>
I asked the noble Earl who leads the House with so much courtesy whether these arguments represented the views of His Majesty's Government, but I was told, as, perhaps, was right and proper, that the Government had no time to deal with abstract discussions of the kind. One would not care so much, perhaps, for what was said by the wilder spirits who are irresponsible members of the Party opposite. But I think it is hardly fair&#x2014;indeed, it is most unreasonable, if I may say so&#x2014;that when those who hold high positions in the Government use arguments of that kind we should not know whether or not they represent the opinion of the Government as a whole. I do not want to go too far, but I go to this length, that in my humble opinion reticence of that kind is not creditable to those of the Government, if there are any, who disagree with these arguments. If they represent the opinions of the Government they should be openly
<col>1034</col>
avowed; if they do not represent the views of the Government then we have a right to know that fact for our comfort and our security. At any rate, these are novel arguments and new in the months of responsible Statesmen.<lb/>
If I had to appeal to any one who <i>par excellence</i> was a Radical, and was also an honest man, I should name John Bright, and when this sort of argument was brought to his notice be said:&#x2014;
<quote>"If you think to relieve the nation by robbing the landowners you admit that any class may be robbed if the nation or the poor require relief."</quote>
Sir W. Harcourt said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am content to assume that a man's right to his land depends upon the same principle as your right to the coat on your back&#x2014;that you have paid for it."</quote>
and he went on in homely style to say,
<quote>"If you want to reform the land laws do not begin by ballyragging the landowners."</quote>
The language is not mine, but I think I might say, if you want to be fair to an unwritten Constitution, do not begin by ballyragging the House of Lords. I have one other quotation, and it has the merit of bringing in the opinion of Mr. Gladstone, as repeated with approval by a member of the present Government. I regret that Lord Wolverhampton is not present to-night. Speaking to his constituents less than two years ago, he was discussing matters affecting Socialism and the appropriation of land as part of that doctrine, and he said he would have nothing to do with any such scheme. He reminded his audience of what he once heard Mr. Gladstone say. There was a conversation, not on Socialism as a whole, but on the nationalisation of land, and, according to Lord Wolverhampton&#x2014;
<quote>"the old gentleman, in his quiet stern way, listened for a long time and then broke out suddenly and said ' Do you mean to pay for it or do you not? If you mean to pay for it it is folly; if you do not mean to pay for it it is robbery.'"</quote>
I want to know before this debate closes whether those on the Ministerial Bench agree with those statements of men who have been colleagues of some of them and whose memory is honoured not only in their own Party but throughout the nation.<lb/>
It has been abundantly admitted by everybody during this debate that we should all contribute to the money which is required according to our ability. It is
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0524"/>
<col>1035</col>
almost a commonplace that the ownership of land is not an adequate test, taken by itself, of ability to pay. Land is already heavily burdened, and the complication of this Bill is such that it is absolutely impossible to estimate how much is added to those burdens. To some extent I stand in a peculiar position. I am responsible for a scheme for making owners of urban land contribute more than they do now to the bearing of public burdens. To that scheme I absolutely adhere. It was arrived at after five years of careful inquiry, during some part of which I had the assistance of Lord Milner as a colleague before he was taken to those greater and more arduous duties in which he has made his name. The opinions which I then ventured to express were not lightly formed. I knew quite well that they would not go the whole length to please those who are described as in favour of the taxation of land values. I did not expect to find that the carefully guarded and I would almost say conservative scheme for which I made myself responsible was to be quoted in support of the wild theories and ridiculous proposals now enshrined in the Bill before the House. What I ventured to suggest&#x2014;I shall not go into it in detail&#x2014;was this, that where it could be proved that increase of value came in any way from public expenditure, special rating should be put on to recompense for that advantage. The Lord Steward, who also is not present, mentioned the Thames Embankment as an illustration in support of the proposals of this Bill. That is quite contrary to fact. The land and buildings along the Thames Embankment derive their increased value quite as much from public expenditure as from what is called unearned increment, and they are one of the most conspicuous instances in which, I think, local authorities might be allowed to derive more benefit from their expenditure than they have done. In recommending that class of scheme we carefully, in a paragraph printed in the forefront of our report, guarded ourselves against being quoted in favour of those wild theories of depriving owners of all or any portion of their unearned increment which are a feature of this Bill. It is not fair to any one who takes part in public life and is appointed to serve on a Royal Commission that what he says in that capacity should be quoted one wit beyond what it will bear by fair and real quotation; and I think no one has suffered more than I have done by being quoted
<col>1036</col>
in support of theories which I have not only not adhered to, but have carefully guarded myself against.<lb/>
As far as land is concerned, in this Bill we have a departure in valuation of the most serious kind. All that is proposed in the matter of valuation will be based on the purest hypothesis, when it is not based on absolute conjecture. The present system of valuation is easy to understand; it is arranged on definite principles; it has worked with extreme smoothness, at all events as far as I know it in Scotland; it is under the jurisdiction of the Law Courts; and it is a most serious departure to uproot that system and put it into the hands of a body of Commissioners without giving them most precise and careful directions. I go so far as to say that the Land Clauses of this Budget are a disgrace if for no other reason than that they are hardly intelligible. You have twelve different kinds of values, including increment value, site value, principal value, gross value, full site value, total value, assessable site value, value for agricultural purposes, original site value, and original total value. Some of these expressions are defined, some are not. One of them is defined and is never used again in any other part of the Bill. Site value in Clause 2 has a different meaning from site value in Clauses 25 and 27. I will ask your Lordships to look at the different subsections of Clause 25, and it really would not be a bad puzzle for an evening in a country house to get a dozen commonsense men to sit down and see if they could really agree on an understanding of that clause as printed in the Bill.<lb/>
Throughout the whole of the first part of the Bill there are special traps and pitfalls for Scottish lawyers. English expressions are used which have no well-defined meaning in Scottish law, and which, if they are to be used in Scotland, ought to be interpreted or specifically applied. I suppose the Lord Advocate was too busy elsewhere to attend to this particular part of his work. I will give one or two examples. Under Clause 14, subsection 5, the gravest doubts exist whether the legal interpretation will have the effect of giving the benefit which I know is intended in the case of Scottish estates which are mortgaged. It is one of the great advantages held out to owners of land to induce them
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0525"/>
<col>1037</col>
to accept the Bill that their incomes will be considered in respect of the mortgages which are upon their estates; but I am informed by more than one legal friend that as the Bill now stands, the gravest doubt exists whether any of your Lordships who own Scottish land would get the benefit of that clause if it were passed into law. Even where an attempt is made, as in Clause 42, to have special application to Scotland, it is doubtful whether Scottish circumstances are met Land is said not to include certain things, but my legal friends express the gravest doubt whether those definitions will work out satisfactorily. Such a conundrum as this arises. Does the upper flat of one of the large buildings now so common in our towns fall within the definition of land? Has the owner of an upper flat any right of property in the site value? Has the owner any right in the <i>solum</i> of the ground, or only a right of support for the building which is erected? Either way, injustice will be done. If the proprietor has no right in the <i>solum</i> of the ground, how can the valuation be applied to his case? He will get off too easily as compared with the owners of other parts of the building. In the other case surely there is a more obvious injustice, because the reason assigned for putting on this tax is that the increase of value, a part of which you want to take, comes not from the exertions of the owner, but from the presence of the community for what it is worth, and the presence of the community does as much to increase the value of one part of the house as that of another.<lb/>
I have scores of similar instances, but I am not going through them. But there is one thing I want to point out. If your Lordships at your leisure will look at Clause 23, subsection (2), you will find a most curious provision. Undeveloped Land Duty is not laid on minerals, but under the subsection to which I have referred minerals are treated as if they had no value as minerals&#x2014;these are the words of the Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"unless the proprietor of the minerals in his return furnished to the Commissioners, specifies the nature of the minerals and his estimate of their capital value."</quote>
That is a suggestion that the proprietor should put a value on his minerals. Why should he do so? Is it for the purpose of assessing increment when the full value of his minerals is obtained? If so, it is
<col>1038</col>
possible that a future development of the Undeveloped Land Duty will come upon him unawares. After all the care which is said to have been devoted to it, the Bill is not free from difficulty, and I believe there would not be one, but a dozen amending Bills required, and some appeals to the Law Court, before a working scheme could be arranged.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I desire to turn to the constitutional side of the question which is before us to-night. After all it is the more important. I agree with the noble and learned Lord, if I may humbly say so, that no one has challenged the abstract right of this House to take the course which the noble Marquess has proposed. But, my Lords, the point is two-fold. It is not only a matter of constitutional practice, but your Lordships must consider what will be the effect upon the usage which has grown up uninterrupted for a great many years. It is a commonplace amongst us that our Constitution is an unwritten one. No appeal to documents is conclusive. It is all a matter of custom, of practice, of precedent, and I am glad that it is so. But the precedents which are so freely quoted do not always fit the altered circumstances in which we now find ourselves. It is absolutely true that this House has never, in so many words, abandoned its control over finance, but it is also equally true that long usage has made the House of Commons supreme in two matters. It is admittedly supreme in its control of the Government of the day and in its control of financial matters. These two things go together and they cannot be separated. But if the other House is supreme in these matters there are limitations to its supremacy. It is supreme only for the time of its life. We may not like to admit that practically the other House is supreme in these matters. I am not saying that it is a perfect Constitution. I am not saying that it might not be improved if you were going in for a written Constitution, if such a thing were possible; but I am arguing from the facts as they appear to me and as I believe they, in essence and in truth, are admitted by every constitutional lawyer.<lb/>
But it is said:&#x2014;"Oh yes, the House of Commons is supreme, but the people are supreme over both Houses of Parliament, and the motion of the noble Marquess is in effect a referendum upon finance." I venture to say, and I say it with some confidence,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0526"/>
<col>1039</col>
that whatever may be the advantages and recommendations of a referendum it is impossible as a matter of practice in financial matters. Finance differs from all other legislation in this respect. If a Bill is rejected either by a vote of this House or by disagreement between the two Houses the <i>status quo</i> which existed before the Bill was proposed survives and remains. It is not so in finance. If you are to establish a system whereby this House or any other authority had the right of establishing a referendum as it is called&#x2014;a reference to the people in matters of finance&#x2014;you would spoil and destroy the control of the other House of Parliament over the Government, and you would make, I venture to say, perhaps the most momentous change in the Constitution, as it has grown up, which has been made in the whole history of that Constitution. Take it how you like, if you pass this Resolution, if you make it a precedent&#x2014;I care not with what safeguard you accompany it, whether you say it is only to be done on extreme occasions or by any other safeguard&#x2014;you have made a change in the practice and in the Constitution which will prevent things going on as they have gone on up to the present time.<lb/>
My Lords, if you win, the victory can at most be a temporary one. If you lose you have altered and prejudiced the position, the power, the prestige, the usefulness of this House, which I believe every one of you honours and desires to serve as heartily and as thoroughly as I do myself. If you win you are but beginning a conflict. Should I say beginning a conflict? You are re-making a conflict which has gone on from year to year and from century to century until the House of Commons has attained the position which I suggest to you it enjoys by usage at the present time. In an unwritten Constitution such as ours perhaps a contest of this kind at some time or another was inevitable. For some time&#x2014;I think for some years&#x2014;most careful observers have seen indications that it was coming. If I may venture to say so, I think in some respects the claims of both Houses of Parliament have been put too high by their respective admirers and their supporters. I am equally against usurpation by this House of the rights and privileges of the other House of Parliament. I agree that neither is supreme over the other, and if we are to work along in the future as we have done in the past there must be a
<col>1040</col>
very considerable amount of give and take and compromise.<lb/>
I have noticed that three somewhat important changes have been growing in our public life for some years. Party organisation has been made more and more perfect. Part either of the advantages or the penalties of that perfection is that with more or less certainty it is crushing out the independence of those who are returned to sit and vote in the other House of Parliament. We have also had an increase of appeal to that most pernicious doctrine which is called the doctrine of the mandate. It is the pride of our Parliament that those who are sent, whether it be to this House or the other, are not delegates, but representatives. They are intended to act upon their mature judgment. Partly the growth of Party organisation, partly the pressure of this pernicious doctrine of mandate is changing that. It is making men more and more into delegates and less and less into representatives. If I may venture to speak of it with respect, the other House of Parliament has changed its procedure. What is known as the guillotine is more and more resorted to. I throw no stone. Both sides have been responsible for it. The Government of which I had the honour to be a member introduced it and increased it. If you take these three things together you will find that the tyranny of the Party majority, the difficulty of dissenting from the proposals of those who are really your leaders, is being greatly increased without that most odious charge which can be brought against a man in public life that he is a traitor to what he has promised or to those with whom he desires to act.<lb/>
This is illustrated very well in the pages of a very able periodical which I sometimes read. It is very much in the interests of noble Lords opposite and their Party, and its present management is evidently high in the favour of the Government, because the editor was made a knight the other day. I refer to the periodical known as the <i>British Weekly</i>. Here is a most instructive sentence which appeared in the issue of the <i>British Weekly</i> last August:&#x2014;
<quote>"It must surely be obvious that there would never be a sufficient number of voters enthusiastic enough about any one reform to carry it in the teeth of the formidable opposition which would make itself felt. When the people vote at an election they vote for a number of reforms, both social and political. The man who cares for one may be quite indifferent about another."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0527"/>
<col>1041</col>
What about the mandate when yon consider these arguments? In effect it comes to this, that you are to have no Second Chamber, you are to have no referendum, because it will interfere with the power of the party organisation to get the legislation out of Parliament whether by a system of log-rolling between different sections or otherwise, and that the particular question shall not be referred distinctly and straightly to the people. In other words, they are not to have the legislation that they want; they are to take what the party managers give them.<lb/>
Then comes the question of what I called give and take. Can any one say, looking back four or five years, that there was a distinct mandate given to the present Government at the last General Election to pass everything which they have suggested to this House precisely in the form in which they have proposed it and in no other? After all, it must be a matter of conjecture whether this or that particular Bill is or is not in the form which the people would most desire. I venture to say that in this matter noble Lords opposite have tried us in the House very hard. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, who has a way of letting little bits of the Radical cat out of the Radical bag occasionally, told us plainly the difficulties of the Government in this matter some time ago. When a certain agriculture holdings Bill was taken up he accepted some Amendments in this House, but when it came back from the other place he told us in effect that, although he was in favour of them and thought them reasonable, and the Government were in favour of them, some of their supporters in the other House of Parliament were such terrible fellows that he could not get their consent, and we should have to give way. Having regard to the consideration I have put before you, there never was a time in the history of this country when, in my humble opinion, a Second Chamber, strong, trusted, and, as it must be in the nature of the case, somewhat Conservative, was more necessary than it is at present.<lb/>
I turn to my own friends and say: Are you wise at this stage, in these circumstances, to make a new claim&#x2014;for it is a new claim which you are making in the Resolution which is before the House to-night? I know quite well what many
<col>1042</col>
of you are thinking, that in matters of strategy attack is often the best defence. I know well when I look round the House and see the faces of people with the immense majority of whom I am proud to claim personal friendship&#x2014;a friendship which I hope I shall never forfeit&#x2014;that the immense majority of you are taking the course which you are proposing to take in what I believe to be a spirit of loyalty to the interests for which you stand, for no self-seeking or selfish purpose of your own. I venture to say, if you will allow me, that to some extent you have been put in a false position. You have been urged to take this course by those in the public Press and elsewhere who, in my opinion, are not the wisest friends of this House, and it is from an honourable feeling that you cannot betray those interests which I have mentioned that you will vote, as I am afraid you are going to vote, for the Resolution which is before you to-night. It is almost an insult for me even to say that I know from personal consultation, as well as from his own high character, that the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House has put down this Motion on the Paper from an absolute sense of duty, and because he thinks it the right and proper course. I am no out and out supporter of this Bill. I do not like its scheme of finance; I do not admire its contents, its form, or its history; I dislike still more the arguments of some of those who support it. In many respects it is not just, it is not fair as between man and man. For the first time our finance is being founded upon class hatred and class jealousy. I say also that its principles could not be permanent without, in my opinion, fatal injury to the best interests of the country. Nevertheless, I do not agree to the wisdom of stopping it in the way and by the method which is proposed.<lb/>
I object to the tactics which combine the defence of a Second Chamber with taxation of some of the prime necessaries of food of the people of this country. I do not want to introduce more elements of division than it is necessary to do. The noble Viscount who spoke late last night said he would raise from thirteen to fifteen millions by a system of tariffs. The noble Lord who is to follow me is the presiding genius of the Tariff Reform League. If either of them will tell me how that amount of revenue can be raised by any of their systems, I will promise to give
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0528"/>
<col>1043</col>
the most careful and earnest consideration to the matter. If they will add to their favour by explaining how they are to get that revenue, as some of them say, by taxing the foreigner, I shall be still more obliged.<lb/>
While I say that I am open to argument, I am not going to have my course diverted either by abuse or ridicule, and still less by coercion. Not very long ago an anecdote was told as illustrating the position of that body to which I am proud to belong, the Unionist Free Traders, which so aptly describes the position in which I find myself to-night that I hope your Lordships will pardon me if I repeat it. The story goes that a negro evangelist who had not, perhaps, thoroughly mastered the principles he set himself to expound announced that in life there were only two paths, one leading to death and the other to damnation. One of his audience said, "In that case this nigger will have to take to the woods." My Lords, I propose to take to the woods.<ob/><lb/>
Will you let me say as a last word that I think noble Lords on this side who are acting with a light heart and without, perhaps, fully studying the gravity of the decision which they are to give, but which I have endeavoured, however feebly, to put before them, are really walking into a trap which has been set for them by those who are not their friends. There never was, in my humble opinion, a time when it was more necessary to make a great effort to combine all those who are described as moderate men. Your action to-night will make that course difficult. You are going, if I may humbly say so to you, to offend the deeper conservative instincts of the country, and that feeling may be reflected at the polls. I think I understand, if I understand I honour, your opinion; I honour the action you take, believing it to be due to conscientious motives; you feel you must fulfil the expectations of your friends, that you will be thought traitors to them if you act otherwise, that you will be betraying them for the sake of saving your own skins, as I have heard it put, and no more odious charge can be brought against any body of men. As I have said, I understand, I even honour, your action. I would like to join you if I could, but my judgment is that it is a false step, alike in the interests of the country and of the House in which I have spent the whole of my political life.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1044</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03491"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find myself unable to follow the masterly analysis of some of the worst faults of this Budget which has been made by the noble Lord who has just sat down. I shall be equally unable to follow him in his masterly inactivity when the Division bell rings. The House will have listened with interest to the review he gave of recent developments in both Houses and in the relations between those two Houses. The House will feel that there has been a difference in legislation of recent years, that there has been a consolidation of Parties, that there has been a tendency to make the power of the caucus more great, that there has been a tendency to make the power of the Government greater and the power of the House of Commons as such less. For those very reasons, and because the use of the closure attendant upon those reasons has changed the situation in the House of Commons, it is now more than ever important that this House should exist as a sound revising Chamber.<lb/>
It is not, as I understand, a consideration of the details of the taxes imposed by this Budget that has induced the noble Marquess to put this motion upon the Paper. It is the collective effect of the whole system of taxation which is involved in the Bill. Practically the measure is all aimed at one class; it aims at what is vulgarly called "taxing the rich." That the rich should pay their share and more than their share is a principle which no man in this country denies. Indeed, the Secretary for Scotland showed that the working man would be paying an increased tax of 2<i>d</i>. on an income of 30<i>s</i>. a week, whereas the man with an income of &#x00A3;5,000 a year would be paying 5<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;. That no doubt is proof that the rich man is to pay more under the present Budget. No defender of this Budget, so far as I am aware, has produced any proof to show that rich men are not now paying their full share of the taxation of this country. The taxation collected in the last ten years shows an increase of seventeen millions, and out of that increase direct taxation, which is practically taxation upon the wealthier part of the population, is represented by thirteen and a-half millions, or eighty per cent. During the last seventeen years the Income Tax, which is practically paid in its entirety by the wealthier classes, has increased from 6<i>d</i>. on unearned incomes to 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. Is not this proof that the increased taxation which
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0529"/>
<col>1045</col>
has been imposed for the necessities of the State within recent years has been borne in full proportion by the richer classes? Not one syllable of proof has been brought forward by supporters of the Budget to show that the rich do not pay.<lb/>
Even if what are known as the rich are to pay under this Budget an increased share of taxation, the poor man does not escape taxation under this so-called "poor man's Budget." His whisky and tobacco are taxed, and his necessity of employment is more severely taxed than anything else in the Budget. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack admitted&#x2014;I believe it is the first time that any defender of the Budget has admitted it&#x2014;that this tax on capital must tend to produce unemployment. But the Budget has been placed before us a "poor man's Budget." But these taxes on capital, it is now admitted, are going to help to tax the poor man's necessity&#x2014;namely, employment. Every Party in the State admits that the question of unemployment is one that needs remedying in one shape or another. No one can doubt that unemployment will be aggravated by the export of capital, so that neither the rich nor the poor escape the financial insecurity caused by the Government's proposals. Upon both of them falls the financial insecurity caused by the lack of credit which is inspired by these proposals, and the poor feel it more because the rich man, after all, has the power to invest his capital abroad, whereas the workman, whose capital lies in his labour, has a greater difficulty in finding an opening for it abroad. In the interests of both classes we should maintain as great a reserve of capital as possible for the time of stress and struggle. But with Consols down to eighty-two, the Income Tax standing at an admittedly extremely high figure&#x2014;a higher figure than the Prime Minister thought too high two years ago&#x2014;and a great raid being made on the Sinking Fund, likely to extend in the future, the possible reserve of taxation is already heavily drawn upon. In what position, therefore, would the rich and the poor be, in the event of a crisis, in finding the money necessary to finance the State?<lb/>
The defence of the Budget is, after all, that the necessary money must be got. Why is it necessary? There are other sources of taxation open. Other countries have for years found large sums of money
<col>1046</col>
from the taxation of imports. Countries with a far smaller volume of imports than we have raise several millions a year. Germany obtains &#x00A3;7,000,000 a year from import duties on manufactured goods, and the United States obtain &#x00A3;38,000,000 from import duties on manufactured goods. It is argued that this state of things would be impossible here. All sorts of arguments are used, and it is said that the cost of collecting the duties on imports into this country would be from twenty-five to thirty per cent. I do not know why. Why should that be so when the cost of collection in Germany is a little over two per cent. and in the United States a little over three per cent.? We are at this moment collecting in Customs duties &#x00A3;31,000,000 every year. We already have in existence at every port in this country Customs' officers whose duty it is to watch every ship for the smallest evasion of our Customs laws. I submit that a small extension of the Customs staff already engaged would enable the authorities to undertake the additional work.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham stated, in the course of the debate, that it would be impossible to bring such a tariff into operation under three years; but not so very long ago a Unionist Government imposed a duty upon corn&#x2014;a new import duty&#x2014;which was imposed at once, the revenue from which in the first year was over two millions. The point is that that duty was imposed at once without any difficulty whatever. I have made a study of the literature issued by the Cobden Club and of other publications of the Free Trade party. This literature as well as the speeches and letters of distinguished Free Traders argue that it is impossible to raise more than an infinitesimal sum by the imposition of import duties. But when it was in the interest of Free Traders a few years ago to show that every penny got by import duties was going to be a burden on the trade of the country, they were anxious to show that a large sum could be raised by import duties, and the Cobden Club not so many years ago proved conclusively that we could raise seventeen millions by means of Tariff Reform, while a member of this House who is a great financial authority&#x2014;Lord Eversley&#x2014;made a calculation about the same time pointing out that under Tariff Reform you might raise twenty millions a year for the necessities of the nation. It may be to the advantage of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0530"/>
<col>1047</col>
Free Traders now, when the question of revenue is to the front, to try and show that the sums obtainable would be small, but the amounts which I have quoted&#x2014;they are not my estimates and I do not endorse them&#x2014;show that in the opinion of men who have made a careful study of the question it is possible and practicable to raise large sums from the imposition of import duties; and as other countries do tax us, so it is reasonable that we should endeavour to tax the foreigner.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite laugh as a rule when the question of taxing the foreigner is mentioned, and the notion that we can tax the foreigner is ridiculed as uneconomic and is looked upon as nothing more nor less, in the words of Mr. Churchill, than "a gull." But no less an economic authority than John Stuart Mill has written:&#x2014;
<quote>"A country cannot be exported to renounce the power of taxing foreigners nnless foreigners will practice the same forbearance."</quote>
So that the principle is admitted to be possible. There are no doubt many who believe that it is impossible for us to raise this money; there are also a number who, while admitting that it is possible under Tariff Reform to raise a large sum of money for the needs of the State, yet find so many objections to the method of raising this taxation that they are unable to support it. I venture to say that in the proposals which His Majesty's Government have laid before us in the present Budget practically every one of the objections which can be urged against Tariff Reform will be found to exist in an aggravated form. It has been alleged, for example, that Tariff Reform involves the extended taxation of food; but at this present moment this country raises more per head in taxation on ordinary articles of consumption&#x2014;food, drink, and tobacco&#x2014;than any other country in the world. It raises twice as much as Germany, nearly twice as much as the United States of America per head of population, and this burden on the ordinary articles of consumption, already great, is increased by the burdens thrown upon them by the present Budget. I do not pretend that drink and tobacco are necessities of life; but that they are ordinary articles of consumption nobody will deny, and the burden upon them is increased and aggravated by a Budget which is intended to be opposed to a system which it is
<col>1048</col>
alleged would place burdens on food and ordinary articles of consumption. It is said that under a system of moderate duties you would have to tax raw material, and notwithstanding all the denials of Tariff Reformers, that statement is persisted in.<lb/>
But, my Lords, under the Budget, by the duties on minerals you are proposing to cast a burden on raw material which everybody is agreed must ultimately fall upon coal, the most necessary of all raw materials for our industries. In placing these duties upon land, even though the burden cast immediately upon agricultural land may not be great, you are placing a duty upon the most necessary of all raw materials, Not only in the case of agricultural land, but in the case of undeveloped land you are placing a duty which will increase the cost to those who are anxious to develop land for industrial purposes. I have had put before me the case of a large landowner, not a member of your Lordships' House, but a business Company, the Trafford Park Estate. That Company acquired a large area of land for something over &#x00A3;900,000, and spent a quarter of a million in developing it as a purely industrial speculation on the soundest possible lines, and in the course of the debate in another place it was undertaken that that expenditure made by this Company upon the development of this property should be a development which would result in their not being charged increment duty. But in the Budget as you find it now, the provisions and exemptions made ostensibly to benefit that company have, as a matter of fact, not benefited them in the very least, because the exemption is only granted to those who made roads and sewers, and the expenditure by this company has been made on railway sidings and other similar undertakings. I mention the details of this undertaking to show that some of these land taxes in their natural incidence are not burdens on undeveloped land, but upon the development of land, and as such are a tax upon one of the most necessary raw materials of this country.<lb/>
I would ask those who think that under a system of tariffs we should be invaded by a mass of corruption which it is alleged exists in the administration of Tariff Reform countries, to remember the danger of which this is one example indulged in that is involved by the present Government creating literally hundreds of new posts
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0531"/>
<col>1049</col>
entirely at the discretion of a Minister temporarily in charge of an Office. I say not a word about the Ministers who have to make these appointments at the present moment under the Development Bill and the Labour Exchanges Bill and the various Agricultural Acts which this Government have passed; but I do say that it has been one of the greatest glories of this country that they have established their Civil Service by means of a competitive examination system, which is the best of all possible systems, and I deprecate the system which has grown up of late years of creating appointments which are entirely at the discretion of Ministers temporarily in charge of Departments. In this Budget there was included a proposal to take the whole of the Old Sinking Fund, and to apply that for different purposes at the disposal of the Government of the day. I think we all see that the tendency under the present Government has been, now that the control of the House of Commons is getting so much less than it was over the Government of the country, to create what was after all an oligarchical bureaucracy in the hands of different Departments, and to place more and more at their disposal the various appointments and the expenditure of national funds. That is a system which seems to me to tend more and more dangerously towards the corrupting of our political life than any system of Tariff Reform possibly could do. If it is alleged that Trusts are a dangerous feature behind Tariffs, I say that under your present system of driving capital abroad in increasing quantities day by day, you are perhaps not creating Trusts in your own country, but you are feeding plentifully foreign Trusts who have your own markets to exploit with the products of your own finances, and under your system you are encouraging perhaps not Trusts in this country, which might be benefiting perhaps in some ways England, but you are encouraging the development of Trusts in other countries which only use the British market to prey in.<lb/>
I have already remarked that unemployment is definitely created and encouraged by this Budget. In that connection I remember a remark which was used by Mr. Gladstone, when he said that you ought, in considering your system of taxation, to operate on those articles which provide the maximum of employment for the people of the country. The Government
<col>1050</col>
by this Budget is operating heavily upon capital, which is precisely that article which does provide and could provide employment for the people of this country if only it was allowed and encouraged to be invested in the development of home industries. So, my Lords, under this Budget, which is paraded as a Poor Man's Budget, and the antithesis of Tariff Reform, and which does not contain the evils which it is alleged Tariff Reform contains, there are in reality more evils than there possibly could be under any system of Tariff Reform. On the staple articles of consumption you are imposing heavy burdens, and on the raw material of industry. In the memory of Cobden you are placing burdens day by day on production which his reforms were meant to lessen, and in the memory of Gladstone you are operating on those very articles which tend to produce the maximum of unemployment in this country. It may be, my Lords, that Tariff Reform is not the only alternative to this Budget, but I am quite certain it is the only practical alternative; and I am quite certain that it is the only alternative that you have the least chance of carrying. In this respect, many of the members of your Lordships' House are in close contact with the opinion of the people of the country, and I am sure you will be certain that it is the only alternative that has the least chance, and the only one which they will ever consider.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not minimise the seriousness of the step which this House will take if it votes and carries the Amendment of the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House, but this I am certain that if this House were to take the advice given us by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, we should then justly earn the opprobrium of being regarded as a party House. It may possibly be in the interests of the Conservative Party to allow this Budget to pass because it may be that within a short time, if the Budget were in operation, the Government responsible for it would be hurled from office as the noble Earl more than once suggested that they would. But, my Lords, this House will not consider whether it is to the advantage of Party, or to the possible advantage of a Party in determining what its proper course of action should be. If we were an annex of the Carlton Club, we might consider the advantages derived from the passing or non-passing of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0532"/>
<col>1051</col>
Budget, but your Lordships' House considers no question of Party advantage, and I agree that your Lordships would be right in saying that you would give the authority which alone can decide this matter the opportunity of deciding for themselves in regard to it. Notwithstanding what noble Lords opposite have said and may say, this issue was not created by your Lordships' House. It was created by no section of the State, except by the Government in power, who only a year ago announced that at the next election the dominant issue was going to be the House of Lords, thus carrying out the various announcements made by the former Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. When the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, made his eloquent speech at Glasgow, it was known to him, as well as to everybody else, that the present Prime Minister had declared that the dominant issue at the next election was to be the House of Lords. If there be an issue, therefore, it is not the seeking of this House, but of the present Government who have taken this means of forcing it to a conclusion.<lb/>
I am but a young member of your Lordships' House, and I have the greatest hesitation in saying one word upon the constitutional principle, or on the constitutional power of the House, but there is no Member who values his seat here more than I do, or who would more willingly retain his privileges in this House than I would. But I would not value this seat, I would not care for its privileges if I did not feel that the House was going to act up to its duty as a Second Chamber in this matter, because of the scarcely veiled threats of the other side, even if it were certain that it was going to lose its power for ever. I remember the late Lord Goschen saying in this House that to propose a change in the tariffs was to gamble with the food of the people. But my Lords, this Government is gambling with their very existence. Upon the financial naval and military stability absolutely depends the existence of this Island Power, and it is upon that that this Government is gambling. It is for us, therefore, by passing the Resolution which the noble Marquess has moved to say that we trust the people to vote for themselves and that they must trust us with the power which is ours as a Second Chamber, to see that it is used for the
<col>1052</col>
benefit of the nation, and that on a chance majority of four years ago we cannot surrender the people to the tyranny of modern Liberal bureaucracy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03492"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we always listen with the greatest interest and attention to the noble Viscount who has just spoken. He stands at the head of a very powerful political body in this country in whose programme and movements we are, of course, very much interested, and we always listen to the noble Viscount in the hope that we may learn something of what the policy of the Tariff Reform League may be. I must say, however, that at the end of his speech we are not much wiser than we were before. The noble Viscount quoted a chance remark of a great Free Trader on the question of taxing the foreigner, but he carefully refrained from telling us how it was to be done. That is a question, my Lords, which has got to be discussed, and which has got to be discussed openly, and if the noble Viscount and those who think with him wish to obtain the following of the country, the sooner they tell us, in view of the election that is at hand, and the clearer they make it to us how this is to be done the better chances they will have of success.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount went on to discuss not the question of the Budget itself but the question that has arisen over the action which your Lordships are taking, and, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Balfour, said, that is for the moment the more important question of the two. My Lords, this Budget will now go to the arbitrament of the country, and the justice or the injustice of the taxes which it imposes will be discussed by the people who are going to pay them. But there is one question, and it is a very great and important one indeed, which has not yet been fully put in all its bearings before the country. I too, like Lord Ridley, am a very young Member, an even younger member of your Lordships' House than he, and I am grateful, as an evitable fate has made me a member of this House, that I should have been lucky enough to become a member of it at a period, what one may call a culminating period perhaps, but certainly a critical period, and one which can only be described as an era of great change in the position which
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0533"/>
<col>1053</col>
this House occupies in the political machinery of the country.<lb/>
The remark has often been passed by Liberals, and the question has come up from time to time during many years, that something must be done in order to deal with the House of Lords. Of recent years that cry has become more and more insistent. The reason of it is not very far to find. You have only to look at the list of the measures which have been sent up to this House by Conservative Governments and by Liberal Governments to see the reason why this cry is becoming more insistent. It is becoming more insistent, my Lords, and the reason is in the fact that every successive Liberal Administration find that a larger proportion of their Bills are rejected and killed by this House. I was going through the list to-day. During the three Liberal Parliaments which preceded the present one eleven Liberal Bills were killed by your Lordships' House. During the four years of this Parliament, seven Liberal Bills have been killed by your Lordships' House, or to be more accurate, will have been killed by next Tuesday night. Of those seven Bills, three of them&#x2014;the Education Bill, the Licensing Bill of last year, and this present Finance Bill&#x2014;represent the main work of three out of our four sessions of Parliament, and were the three biggest Bills which this Government has been responsible for. When you realise that in the period covered by the last four Liberal Parliaments not one single Conservative measure of any kind has been rejected by this House, you are brought face to face with the fact that there has been a frank abandonment by the House of Lords of its ancient position as a revising Chamber, and that it now stands in the political arena as a competing body with the House of Commons on Party lines.<lb/>
My Lords, how does that work? The noble Marquess, rd Salisbury, said last night that when this House differs from the House of Commons on any measure that the House of Commons sends up to it, that measure should be submitted to the considered judgment of those who are our masters. That is a very sound maxim, my Lords, but if you are to follow that it would mean that the General Election before us now would have been the third General Election since this Parliament came into power four years ago, and that under a system of that kind you are going to have Septennial Parliaments for the Conservative
<col>1054</col>
Party and Annual Parliaments for the Liberal Party. Lord Onslow's statement last night that this country will not stand a Single Chamber Legislation was cheered by noble Lords opposite, but I do not know whether noble Lords opposite realise that at this moment we are governed by the most insidious form of Single Chamber Legislature. When the Conservative Party are in power there is very little of the House of Lords and when the Liberal Party are in power there is very little of the House of Commons. What is the result of this? The result seems to me to be as clear and as certain as that night follows day, that when any Liberal Prime Minister takes office he will have to ensure that he has not merely, as heretofore, a majority in the House of Commons, but that he must have a majority in both Houses of Parliament, or, at any rate, that the present power of the House of Lords, acting as it does on Party lines, must be so curtailed that the work of Parliament can go forward. My Lords, when you consider the methods by which this, the final act in a long stage of acts, has been reached, I think it shows that the position as it stands at the present moment is an impossible one.<lb/>
Let us look at the history of finance as it has been carried on during this present year. Noble Lords opposite connected themselves with the demand for a very great increase of expenditure at the beginning of this year. When preparations were made for that expenditure, when the sums which Parliament would have to vote in due course were marshalled together, and when they were presented to Parliament ear-marked for separate purposes, as they are in the Appropriation Act&#x2014;when that Bill came up to your Lordships' House your Lordships were perfectly aware of the methods which were proposed for raising the money which was required by the Appropriation Act&#x2014;I think that under those circumstances, knowing the means by which that money was to be found, it would have been better, had your Lordships decided to stop the ordinary financial working of Parliament by dealing with the Appropriation Bill. But you allowed the Appropriation Bill to pass and thereby pledged the Government to the expenditure of money which you now refuse to allow them to find. What was done in the case of the Appropriation Act was done in an even more aggravated
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0534"/>
<col>1055</col>
form in the case of the Development Bill, because the Development Bill, which is now an Act, depends for the money which is to be spent under it entirely upon the Finance Bill which is before your Lordships' House at the present time. Those two Bills have been passed and that money is therefore pledged, and now your Lordships step in and veto the finding of this money. Had this House wished to protest against and to stop the present financial methods which have been followed by this Government; had they wished to arrest them because they thought it a matter of some danger to the country, surely they could have taken earlier steps and left the issue a good deal simpler and clearer than it is at the present moment.<lb/>
When one considers all the obvious and inevitable consequences of the attitude which the House of Lords has taken up on the most important political questions of the day, and when on the top of that one considers the way in which the House has conducted this last stage with regard to the finance of the country, it is not for me to ask your Lordships to pause and consider the seriousness of it. And for this reason: because I think I should be insulting your Lordships if I assumed that your Lordships must yourselves have realised clearly that this step which you are going to take at the end of this debate is just as much an incentive to revolution as was, for instance, the levying of ship money. I would like to put to you the financial position created by the killing of the Budget as it appears to one who represents in this House one of the great spending departments of the State. An absolutely impossible situation is created thereby from the point of view of conducting the Governmental administration in this country, and I must say that the position created by your Lordships' action seems to me to preclude, when we do come to a settlement, the setting of it again on existing lines. The Army Estimates were passed at the beginning of last April but they represented the work of the War Office and of the Treasury dating back very many months previous to that. It was about a year ago that those Estimates were settled and that the policy of the War Office for the coming year was thrashed out, item by item, and was finally decided upon. It was at that time that the actual sum which was to be spent was fixed. My Lords, at the beginning of the
<col>1056</col>
financial year, when the House of Commons passed its financial resolutions, the War Office began spending that money which was voted in the Estimates, and the Exchequer began to collect it by means of the Budget resolutions. It is only on the certainty that those resolutions have hitherto provided that the money you are spending on your great services, the money agreed to in the Estimates passed in the Autumn previous to the year in which the Budget is introduced, will be raised, that the policy of the great Government Departments can be settled. At the present day probably something like half, or possibly more than half, the money that was voted in the Army Estimates has been already spent, and if any uncertainty arises with regard to the finding of the money, as uncertainty is bound to rise in view of the attitude of your Lordships, not only will that uncertainty paralize the whole of the work of the great Departments, but will make it impossible for any man in charge of a Department to carry it on. Suppose the Government were to refuse to go to the country, what position will your Lordships find yourselves in then? This House has rendered the action of the House of Commons in financial affairs perfectly futile.<lb/>
The House of Commons is now helpless. On the other hand what can the House of Lords do? It seems to me that you are forced into this position if you are going to allow this House to absolutely nullify the work of the House of Commons in matters of finance, that the obvious and the only corollary to that proposal is that you should allow this House to make use of some part at any rate of those powers of which it has deprived the House of Commons. By this breach of the custom of the Constitution you find yourselves face to face with what is frankly and openly an illegal and an unconstitutional position, and the logical conclusion is that it ought, if it is possible, to itself initiate a money Bill. That is the position your Lordships are in at the present time. I quite agree, as regards the War Office, that means will have to be found for legalising the collecting of the money that has already been spent but I repeat unless you have a certainty that the machinery which has always worked so well and which has now in these matters been brought down to a very fine point of organisation, is not to be interfered with, you will destroy all
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0535"/>
<col>1057</col>
confidence in those Government offices where the money is spent and all possibility of their working out and practising anything like a continuous or an economical policy.<lb/>
My Lords, in all this debate I have felt that the most impressive of many impressive speeches and which but for one or two omissions in it, has been the most powerful indictment against this Budget, was the brilliant speech of Lord Revelstoke on the first day of this debate. I know Lord Revelstoke said that he only appreached this question from the point of view of the City and the attitude that the City took towards it. I hope, my Lords, that if what from my point of view struck me as omissions were simply omissions because he did not want to cover the ground too widely, that the noble Lord will put me right. The City, my Lords, represents a part, and a most important part, of the great fabric which we call British commerce. It is, if one may so express it, one end of that great machine. It is the end at which all problems tend to become to a certain extent de-humanised. Those problems which at the other end of the machine are problems of flesh and blood, at his end of the machine are problems of gold and silver. A great many of the questions which effect what I call the other end of the machine, which are to a great extent social questions and which have a very important bearing on the working of the other end, are questions which cannot enter into a place like the City, and I think one is always inclined to ask oneself whether the City does or does not take an interest in what you may broadly call social problems, and how far they allow things of that kind to enter their calculations.<lb/>
I do not think I misconstrue what the noble Lord stated when I say his opinion was that the feeling in the City was that they would like to go back to the days before the Government took office. That was the point of view from which he looked at it as being far preferable to the position in which it is at the present day. If that is so, if the City thinks that this country, as it was in the days immediately preceding the advent of this Government, was in a safe condition and one suitable for the development of industry and enterprise, then, my Lords, all one can say is that the City does not consider social problems.
<col>1058</col>
Because in so far as you were building up any great enterprise in those days in this country which involved the expenditure of large sums of money, you were raising an edifice on a base in which there were fissures, and those fissures were getting a little bit wider every day. The fissures I refer to, that we were faced with then, were a decreasing birth-rate, a deteriorating national physique, a growing state of discontent due to the fact that little or nothing was being done for unemployment in the way of organising the labour market, that great hardships were being borne in consequence, and that there was nothing in front of the workers of this country beyond a penniless and hopeless old age. Further than that, my Lords, no social reformer can get away from the fact that there was also growing and becoming more serious every day the effects of what we regard as the great vested monopolies, the Land and the Liquor trade. There is another thing that I thought the City would have taken great notice of because I think it is a thing which affects them most of all, and that is that in the ten years preceding the year 1905 there was probably the greatest growth of Socialism that this country has ever seen simply due to the fact, in my opinion, that there existed those great growing evils amongst us, and that nothing was being done to cope with them.<lb/>
My Lords, that was the position at that time. What was it due to? I believe it was due to totally insufficient attempts having been made to try and combat, by every scientific means possible, the hopelessly unnatural conditions which have existed in this country for over 100 years, ever since the date of what is called the industrial revolution, and that those evils, the crowding into towns, and all the other evils that we know of, were allowed to grow unchecked and were coming so rapidly to a head and had reached so great a size that nothing would meet them. And nothing will meet them now, because after all they by no means are reformed yet, except the application of a surgeon's knife; and there is no question that a great deal of difficult work and a great deal of social upheaval and a certain amount of uneasiness and of unrest must be the result of the operation. My Lords, I think that is, putting it in as few sentences as one can, the position broadly with regard to what I may call social
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0536"/>
<col>1059</col>
reform at the present day. One could not help feeling all through the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Revelstoke&#x2014;I hope I am not misconstruing him in any way&#x2014;that although these social conditions were plain for everybody to see, this great dehumanised money-making machine asking for its toll of money or mead of human labour, and all those things which go to make up trade, was regardless of and even prepared to thwart, because that is the position it occupies at the present day, social reform if social reform tends to decrease those supplies which it requires.<lb/>
It seems to me if that is the true attitude of the City, that it is a thing which is capable of doing infinite harm; and above all it is a machine which will grind out a far larger number of Socialists than anything this Government can do. My Lords, I do not believe that is the position of the City at all in this matter. One knows it is not, and therefore one feels this, that when the City realises that this Government are not Socialists but are Social Reformers who are trying to wipe off some of the arrears of the last 100 years in the way of reform which previous Governments have left behind them&#x2014;I hope that there will be, and I think one ought to feel a certain amount of confidence in feeling that there will be, a revival of confidence on the part of the City and that they will realise that after all what we are striving for is to make that base upon which all their interests, all the labours and the industry which they create depends, as sound as it possibly can be made. Surely my Lords, that is a thing, when it is realised, as I think it will be realised very shortly, towards which the City as well as every other part of the community will co-operate and help. The noble Lord said that a great deal of the money which is being invested by the City was being invested abroad. I do not know how far people who have money to invest take it to the City and insist on the City investing it for them in exactly what they themselves want, or how far they are prepared to take the advice of the City as to how it should be invested. It is pretty certain that both things happen and that the general attitude of the City is responsible to a great extent for a percentage&#x2014;I cannot say more than that because I have not the remotest idea of what the percentage is, of how that money is invested. We all know that the knowledge, acumen, and foresight of the City in
<col>1060</col>
all matters connected with its work is very great; and when you say that, you give it credit for a knowledge which covers a very large field. But, I do not think it covers everything in a world where no one is infallible, and there undoubtedly are a number of things which do not come within the purview of the City. I do not think they are anymore infallible than the rest of mankind, and one of the things on which I would question their infallibility is in their inability to conjecture the outcome of what this extraordinarily complicated and difficult political situation is going to be, because when the noble Lord tells us the view of the City on the political situation, that political situation being the speeches of the members of His Majesty's Government they might be right or they may be wrong, but I do not suppose they are any more right or any more wrong than the rest of us.<lb/>
My experience of these things is very limited but I know of one instance, which although quite outside the present case is perhaps on all fours with it, of how far the City was right or wrong in forming an opinion. It is with regard to the South African war. In those days I was a journalist and used to follow those things more closely than I do now, and I can only say that the information one got in the City was very much less trustworthy than that which came from any other source. So much so that it became a common saying if you wanted to know what was not going on in South Africa you must go and ask the City. Following up this, I was looking up old files of <i>The Times</i> the other day and I saw that on the eve of Colenso Consols were rushing up because the City thought that Ladysmith was relieved, and the same thing happened&#x2014;Consols were going up&#x2014;on the night when our troops were pouring down the sides of Spion Kop and the Boers on the summit of it. Again, when the day came that the Boers decided to accept peace at Vereeniging, Consols were two points lower than they were on the day before. To talk about the City packing up its stocks and shares and bonds and sending them abroad as ballast, because they have read into some sentence of a speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer a kind of savage Socialism, which does not exist in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's breast, recalls, I must say, to a certain extent the not very pleasing spectacle of the City rejoicing on the eve of British defeats, and depressing Consols on the eve of a great British victory.<lb/>

<col>1061</col>
Now my Lords, I return for one moment to the subject on which I began my speech, and particularly with regard to the question which is before your Lordships' House. The policy which has been followed by the Opposition in this House has been a perfectly plain one. I do not think its best friend could call it a democratic one; and therefore, my Lords, when we suddenly see that the opinion of the country is going to betaken on this question, it is at any rate a change from what the steady trend of policy, about which I spoke earlier in my speech, has been. My Lords, what is the question that is going to be pat before the country next January? The question is not going to be whether we do or whether we do not want to raise an extra seventeen millions in taxation. That is a point which has been settled. Whichever Party comes in, we are committed to the expenditure of money. The question which is going to be asked the country at the next election is, whether we wish to raise it by Free Trade methods, as exemplified in the present Budget, or by that alternative method which the noble Marquess mentioned in his speech, that is to say the method of Tariff Reform? My Lords, the importance of the step which is being taken in order to be in a position to place this matter before the country we are all agreed upon. Therefore, I should have thought that the obvious corollary of that is that the country should be put in a position in which they really can form a judgment on this question; and there is only one way in which a judgment on this question can be arrived at, that is by putting the two alternatives boldly before them.<lb/>
The noble Marquess suggested the other night that my noble friend the Leader of the House might have in his box a complete scheme for dealing with this perfectly unprecedented position which has arisen. Is it too much to suggest that the noble Marquess might have in his box a document that he has had seven years to prepare, that is to say a Tariff Reform Budget? I do not wish to ask an impossibility, and I would not ask the opposite Party to produce the Budget which it proposes to bring in if it is returned to office; but I think the country has a right to demand to know something of the broad line of the alternative you are going to ask them to vote upon. Is food going to be taxed or not? We have been told that
<col>1062</col>
food is not going to be taxed and that the cost of living is not going to be increased, but that imported manufactures are going to be taxed for the purposes of revenue and for improving the conditions of employment in this country. My Lords, I do say this, when you have taken up the position you have taken up at the present time, when you say you are prepared to go the length that you are going, when you say you are prepared to overthrow the fabric of the Constitution in order that you may obtain the judgment of the people, it is cant if you do all that and say all that, and at the same time prevent the people from having that information without which it is impossible for them to form a judgment.<lb/>
You cannot get away from the fact, my Lords, that you are at one and the same moment upsetting the existing order of things on the one hand and holding back the information from the country so as to prevent them from forming a fair and a just judgment of the position, on the other. I admit, my Lords, that the tactical advantages of the situation lie with you. Our position is exposed, and you do not have to expose a single gun on your position. But, my Lords, I do not think the country cares for that, and I believe that unless you are prepared to give the country the opportunity of forming a judgment in the only way in which it can be done, by laying your alternative proposals before them, the country will agree with us in thinking that the democratic, attitude you have taken up with regard to this matter of refusing to pass the Finance Bill until the country has had an opportunity of pronouncing judgment upon it first, is not a genuine one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03493"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after a strenuous fight lasting for over six months a difficult and complicated Budget has been produced by the other House. That Budget, of course, has been radically altered since it was first introduced into the House of Commons, and to my mind the most important clause in the whole of the Budget, I mean the clause annexing the Sinking Fund and taking it for development purposes, has been entirely dropped. We have had also the Licensing Clauses and the Land Clauses tacked on to this Budget. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, to whose speeches we always listen with so much respect and with so much interest
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0538"/>
<col>1063</col>
said the other night that he thought the Licensing Clauses had not been tacked on to the Budget. With your Lordships' permission I should just like for one moment to argue that question from a commonsense point of view and not from a political point of view, because I feel that they are not always the same. What are the facts with regard to the Licensing Clauses?<lb/>
It will be in your Lordships' memory that last year a Licensing Bill was brought in in the House of Commons; it was passed there by a large majority; it was sent up to your Lordships' House and it was rejected by your Lordships by an equally large majority. After it had been rejected we began to hear for the first time threats and mutterings uttered by people in high places in the Liberal Party that the last state of the Licensing Bill would be worse than the first; and then suddenly, for some reason or other, the Liberals seemed to have discovered that those great Licensing Clauses, which surely were important enough to be included in a Bill by themselves, were not important enough for a separate Bill, but should be added to the next Budget. What is the common-sense of the question? Is it not this, that the House of Commons thought with their big majority of 300 that they would be able after being defeated on the Licensing Bill in a straight fight, to tack these clauses on to the Finance Bill and to press them through your Lordship's House. That is why I think, looking at it from a common-sense point of view we are entitled to say that the Licensing Clauses at any rate were tacked on to the Budget.<lb/>
Now, the Commons have thought it reasonable to say to your Lordships' House: "Here is this Budget Bill, pass it unaltered, or take the consequences." So far as human actions are concerned, no man can tell what the consequences may be. The consequences of any action men may take are in the lap of the gods. For my own part, having to choose, as I have to choose, between this Budget and the rejection of the Budget I unhesitatingly say that I am in favour of the rejection of the Budget, and I must take the consequences of that action. The country no doubt will be flooded with a considerable deal of violent eloquence. We cannot wonder at that because, after all, the leaders of the Liberal Party have indulged in violent invective, and in those circumstances Under- 
<col>1064</col>
Secretaries of course follow Secretaries of State, and those who are anxious to get into Parliament and those who are in Parliament follow in the wake of the Under-Secretaries. I have two quotations here which I think will interest the House if the House is good enough to allow me to read them. One of them will certainly make the House laugh and give us an opportunity of congratulating the Liberal Party on what is evidently a very valuable recruit. It was William Pitt who said "Where men complain without cause, they complain without temper." The first quotation I want to read to your Lordships is one from an address issued by Mr. Masterman, an Under-Secretary of State, to his constituents. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"The difficulty all through in carrying out the will of the people expressed at the last election has been the insolent opposition of the House of Lords to all reform."</quote>
The next quotation is a very laughable one, and funnily enough was made in a speech addressed to a meeting of ladies in one of the Yorkshire constituencies. I will not mention the names, although I have them before me if necessary.
<quote>"They would fight and beat the House of Lords. They would go to the gilded Chamber and ram the Budget down the Lords' gilded throats even if it gave them pain and produced a cataclysm in their gilded shirt fronts."</quote>
I congratulate the opposite party upon possessing a gentleman who is evidently a very valuable recruit, in Yorkshire at any rate. Let us look at the tendency of Radical finance in the past so that we may, if possible, arrive at what the minds of their leaders may be in the future with regard to finance. I noticed that in 1906 they took a shilling off coal, which realised two and a half millions sterling. In 1906 they took a penny off tea, which represented one million and a quarter sterling, and in 1908 they did what I think was a very extraordinary thing from a financial point of view&#x2014;they took off half the sugar duty, which amounted to no less than three millions. This was extraordinary, because they were face to face with this position. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had to find eight millions for Old Age Pensions, three millions for Dreadnoughts, and four millions for what I call fancy legislation, such as the Development Fund, money for roads, and land valuation. So that they had to find altogether fifteen millions of money, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer began by taking three millions off the sugar tax. I
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0539"/>
<col>1065</col>
think that was bad finance, and showed a desire to make it as difficult as possible in the future to find the money that was necessary to carry on the business of the nation. To my mind there would have been no difficulty, if only ordinary prudence had been exercised, but there seems to have been a desire to make vast changes all at once. I cannot help feeling that in the history of a nation, for after all the life of a nation is long, if you have to make large changes the proper policy is to spread them over a series of years. If you make them all at once, it will lead to inevitable unrest, especially in regard to finance. The next point I desire to refer to is with regard to land taxation. I allude to it because I think, judging by a quotation I am going to read to you from a speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on August the 18th last, the right hon. gentleman has departed from the ways of previous great masters of finance, who, in the past, first sat down to calculate what the financial needs of the nation would be during the coming year, and then tried to find a way of meeting those needs, each separate year standing on its own basis.<lb/>
What Mr. Lloyd George said on August 18 was as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"We have budgeted as regards the Land Tax for &#x00A3;675,000 this year. We are going to have the money. Next year I venture to say it will be double that amount, and it will grow from year to year until it will amount to millions a year."</quote>
So you see he went altogether outside the boundary of one year, and seemed to have in his mind millions and millions of money which would come to him out of land in years to come. So far as I understand the position of land during late years it is very bad policy and very bad finance to say that you are going to get millions and millions of money out of land whether it is agricultural land or urban land, because I verily believe that if any man in either of these Houses of Parliament thirty years ago had invested his money in either agricultural or in urban land, and had left it until this day, he would have done quite as well by investing his money in Consols. Now we come to a very interesting tax indeed, and it is interesting because it can be applied in such novel ways&#x2014;the increment duty on site values. It will be in your Lordships' minds that this is a very one-sided proposal, because the valuation of sites is to be made every five years,
<col>1066</col>
and if the value has gone up in the meantime the Government are going to get twenty per cent. of the increase, whereas if the value has fallen the individual owner has to find the money himself. That seems to be grossly unfair. As has been said, why should land alone be singled out for this increment tax? That is where the gravity of this policy comes in, and the policy of extending this increment duty to what I should call the general business affairs of life has already been mooted, because on the 24th of September last no less a person than the Home Secretary said this&#x2014;it is very interesting and may be very far reaching&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not see at all why at some future time when more money is wanted the principle of the unearned increment should not be applied to other forms of property as well as property in land."</quote>
Now, does the country realise the gravity of a statement of that sort? Let us take one or two ordinary transactions in life. A stockbroker goes into the Stock Market, and buys &#x00A3;100 Consols at the price of eighty-five. He waits until Consols go up, and when the next valuation comes round they may be at ninety-five. He has to pay, under this new Budget, twenty per cent. of that increase to the Government. If on the other hand, however, they fall to seventy-five, the stockbroker has to bear the loss himself. Take another case. A man goes into the Wheat Market, and buys wheat at 40<i>s</i>. a quarter. Wheat goes up to, say, 45<i>s</i>., and the buyer would have to pay part of that increase to the Government, but if it falls to 35<i>s</i>., he has to bear the loss himself. It is obvious that no dealings of that sort would be undertaken if the increment duty is placed on anything but land. A trader is willing enough in the ordinary course of trade to say "I will take an even chance if it goes up or down," but he is not willing to play with loaded dice. If you apply the increment principle to the business affairs of everyday life, I say without hesitation that it will mean ruin to the business of this country.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, we come to what I can only describe as these amazing increases in the liquor licences. No trade could bear such increases as we have in this Budget. Messrs. Buxton and Whitbread wrote to <i>The Times</i> to say that their increases in taxes under this Budget would mean that they would have to pay no less
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0540"/>
<col>1067</col>
than &#x00A3;104,000. It has been already pointed out in this debate that their dividend amounted to &#x00A3;61,000 and therefore the whole of the ordinary dividend would be swept away, and they would be &#x00A3;50,000 short to pay the interest on their Preference Shares and Debentures. As I said before, when I spoke in this House on the Licensing question, this means the ruin of very many innocent shareholders. On-licences are worse treated than anything else under the Budget, because no less than half the yearly value of licensed premises is put on as a tax. For instance, a man who now owns a house worth &#x00A3;400 a year pays &#x00A3;40 in taxation. Under the new Budget he will pay &#x00A3;200 a year. I have some figures here that are rather interesting, and are quite new. They refer to a city which I know something about&#x2014;the City of Leeds. I only had them sent to me the other day to show the enormous increase in licence fees in a city like Leeds. The first set of figures refers to on-licenced houses owned by brewers. The present duty is &#x00A3;9,172, and the proposed duty is &#x00A3;27,460. On-beer houses, that ought to be specially well treated by reason of their strong position under the 1869 Act, pay now &#x00A3;1,216, but they will pay under the new Budget &#x00A3;10,561. There are 105 ale-houses not owned by brewers, and they pay now &#x00A3;3,450, but they will pay &#x00A3;11,844. Ninety-one beer-houses now pay &#x00A3;336, but they will pay &#x00A3;3,333. I think, my Lords, I am justified in saying that these increases are really amazing. As regards hotels, that are so very necessary to our comfort, and to the comfort of our foreign friends, who come to us, the increase of taxation is large, but I allow at once that there are rebates made as regards that taxation if the amount of liquor sold in those hotels bears a small proportion to the food and bedrooms which are provided for their customers. But we must not forget that the site tax comes in with regard to the big hotels in London, and if the site value of a large hotel like, for instance, the Hotel Cecil goes up, the hotel has to face that. I call these clauses very revengeful clauses. They bring in no revenue, and we know quite well that education and temperance, if let alone, are doing all and more than is necessary to bring the liquor trade into a proper condition. It seems to me that the country or, at any rate, the House of Commons does not recognise the gravity of smashing a big trade like this all at once.<lb/>
<col>1068</col>
I come now to a very interesting question indeed, I mean the question of Death Duties. Under this new Bill, the incidence of these duties is as certain as death, and is as capricious as death itself. The most interesting figures and the newest figures I have come across lately were the figures given us in the most interesting speech delivered by the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp. He told us what I had not known before, how much it is necessary for a man who is fifty years old to pay in insurance if he wants to guard himself and his estate against (1) Income Tax, (2) Super Tax, and (3) Death Duties. Those figures were full of interest, and if I can put them before your Lordships in a clear way I think you will see that the new duties are very large indeed. I doubt if there is any country in the world at the present time that puts such a large taxation on estates as will be put on large estates in this country under this Bill. The noble Earl gave us instances of estates worth &#x00A3;50,000 and &#x00A3;100,000, and half a million and one million pounds. Let us take the case of a man who is aged fifty, and who is the owner of a million either in property or in money. He, we may suppose, is a family man, and he has a very earnest and proper desire to leave the property that he received from his father without any reduction. Now what has he got to do under the old Budget? It would cost him an insurance of &#x00A3;5,600 a year. Under the new Budget it would cost him &#x00A3;9,000 a year. He is going to get three per cent. for his money, which comes to &#x00A3;30,000 a year, and he has to pay one-third of that, or in round figures &#x00A3;10,000 a year to the Government, or rather to the Insurance Company to enable him to leave to his successor the money unimpaired. Take 30,000 sovereigns a year, and out of every sovereign, for all time, he will have to pay 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. to the Government of this country, and not only will he have to pay it, but his son will have to follow it up, and his grandson and his great grandson. All of them will have to pay 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; to the Government to enable them to maintain their estate intact. If the head of the family happens to have more than one son, God knows what he will do to keep his estate intact. He cannot do it, and I say advisedly that unless there are most prudent generations of men coming on one after the other, these tremendous Death Duties, because they are nothing else, will ruin every estate
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0541"/>
<col>1069</col>
in this country. As I said, these figures are very interesting, and they brought home to my mind what I never thoroughly realised before, the enormous propositions made by the Government with regard to these new Death Duties.<lb/>
Let us now consider for a moment the Super Tax. That is perhaps a reasonable tax from some points of view. I would not say it is not; I think it is, but it is inquisitorial, and it is a very difficult tax to understand. I notice with some degree of amusement, and perhaps a little alarm, that the penalty for a wilful mis-statement is six months imprisonment with hard labour. I think there can be no doubt that the Budget itself, the speeches made by those of high official position&#x2014;the hen-roost men&#x2014;and the threats made especially against one of the greatest trades in this country&#x2014;I refer to the railway trade, in which there is no less than &#x00A3;1,200,000,000 of capital employed&#x2014;have thoroughly unsettled the financial mind of the country. There is no doubt that all these things are frightening capital out of the country. I see that. I have means of judging that, and I have no doubt at all that it is so. It is not for me to say whether it is wise for people to be frightened, or to think that they can get in a foreign country five per cent. as safely as they can get four percent. in this country. Perhaps greediness has had some little to do with the flight of capital from this country, but I am convinced that the great and the dominant reason is due to a feeling of fear. It is not for me to give advice. It would not be right for me to give advice to the great British public, for whose opinion I have the greatest respect, and who are in the long run generally in the right. My first set of statistics has been used already. I think it was Lord St. David's who said these figures were not to be relied upon, but I think upon the whole they can be relied upon. Of course, they do not give the money raised in England privately for English things, but as some noble Lord said speaking earlier to-day, they give the general tendency of the investments now going on. In the last nine months &#x00A3;155,000,000 capital has been raised&#x2014;&#x00A3;86,000,000 of it for foreign loans, &#x00A3;53,000 for Colonial loans, and &#x00A3;16,000,000 only have been raised for things in England. Then again, we see Consols and other gilt-edged stocks at the lowest price they have touched since 1880. Enormous
<col>1070</col>
losses have had to be paid owing to the continuous fall in the very best class of Stocks.<lb/>
There is another fairly sure sign of the flight of capital from this country at the present time. It is a sign that has not been alluded to by any speaker in your House up to the present, but I think I am right in my conclusion that it is owing to capital leaving this country. I mean the gold famine that at this moment is reigning in the City. It is not a credit famine, for money there is in plenty, but it is what is called a gold famine. Have we been buying more cotton, or more wheat, or more wool? Certainly not, but we have to find a great deal of gold for foreign countries, and that is evidently because we have been buying largely of foreign loans, much more heavily than before, and that has given foreign countries, especially countries in South America, a power over our gold market they have never had before. We have been buying their loans, and they have decided that they would be paid in gold. The result has been that there has been a gold famine in this country during the last few weeks, and it is more difficult and more expensive than ever to get credit in our markets just now.<lb/>
In the last nine months British and Indian stocks have fallen from &#x00A3;763,000,000 to &#x00A3;753,000,000, a fall of &#x00A3;10,000,000 in the last nine months. Now what of foreign stocks of the like class in the last nine months? They have gone up from &#x00A3;813,000,000 to &#x00A3;826,000,000, so that while our British and Indian stocks have gone down within the last nine months &#x00A3;10,000,000, foreign stocks have gone up no less than &#x00A3;13,000,000. The Prime Minister, in the argument that he used in the House of Commons, rather hailed the flight of capital to foreign countries because, he said, and said with a certain amount of truth, that we in this country would get the interest from these investments, and that those foreign countries who took our money would spend a good deal of it in buying articles from this country. There is a certain amount of truth in that, but it is not the whole truth, because evidently the most important thing of all is that sufficient capital should be left in this country to enable us to look after our own industries and our own businesses. That is a very vital thing, to keep sufficient
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0542"/>
<col>1071</col>
capital in this country for all our needs; but that is not what we are doing at the present moment. There are two trades suffering very much just now, namely the building trade and the railway trade. The building trade, I apprehend, is not suffering from want of capital so much as from fear of the Land Clauses of the Budget. I allow that, and I cannot use it as an argument, but I can use this as an argument for all it is worth, and that is that at the present moment if any of the large and important railway companies of this country want to borrow money, not on their ordinary stocks&#x2014;investors may reasonably be frightened of ordinary stocks&#x2014;but on their preference and debenture stocks, they would have to pay more for their loans than they have had to pay since 1878. That shows very conclusively that capital is scarcer than it used to be in our own home markets.<lb/>
What the nation wants at this moment more than anything else is employment for its men, not charitable employment, but regular employment, and a rest for some years, if I may say so without disrespect, from the meddling and muddling of Parliament. I say, my Lords, go to the people. Consult the people. Do not go to a four-year-old House of Commons that has ceased to represent the people, if any inference we can get from recent by-elections is to be drawn. I do not think, and I never have thought, there is any need for revolution, either financially or in any other way. Of course, the ways of Governments and of Government officials are very difficult to understand, but where a &#x00A3;50,000,000 deficit is going to arise I cannot understand, except in one particular. We know quite well that the great bulk of the Income Tax of the country falls to be collected between December 31st and March 31st. Now there is one grave danger, and only one, and that is, if we do not pass a Budget Bill before the 31st March, we should lose, perhaps, &#x00A3;30,000,000 or &#x00A3;35,000,000 of Income Tax. But if we do pass a Budget Bill before the 31st March, I do not see myself that there will be any great need for borrowing very much money. I am sure there will not be this need unless the great Liberal Party are, may I say with all respect, foolish enough to try and bring about financial chaos because, forsooth, after being in power for four years they find it necessary to consult the people of
<col>1072</col>
this country. Surely a big party like the Liberal Party will never think that that is good policy or good tactics. For all the reasons that I have been so kindly allowed to put before your Lordships, I feel sure the right course is being pursued when we say that we shall support the Amendment of the noble Marquess, the Leader of the Opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03494"><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I commence I should like to express in common with your Lordships my regret that we have been deprived to-night of a speech from one of the most distinguished members of this House, Lord Curzon. I have had the pleasure of knowing him more years than I like to remember, and I shall always remember with some pride that I had the privilege of following him in the House of Commons, and endeavouring to answer him in the very first speech he made there, and in the very first speech which I made. The noble Lord who has just sat down will, I am sure, not think I am guilty of any discourtesy if I do not follow him in his very interesting speech. He is a great authority on financial matters. I am not an authority on such matters, and I do not intend to-night to refer to matters of finance. I must confess, although I think I may say I have taken part in almost all the great debates in this House for the last fifteen years, and although I have had twenty-five years of political life in one House or the other, I never rose to speak in any debate with a deeper sense of responsibility than I do on this occasion, a responsibility which attaches itself to the voice and vote of even so humble a member of your House as I am. I have followed this debate with great attention. I have listened to and admired the very admirable and statesmanlike speeches that have been made, but&#x2014;and I say it without, I am sure, at all wishing to give any offence&#x2014;when I have listened to the witty and somewhat light-hearted remarks of this noble Lord or that noble Lord, I have rather wondered whether this House in its entirety thoroughly appreciates the enormous gravity of the question which is before us, and which has been raised by the Amendment of the noble Marquess opposite.<lb/>
I have often in the past, as most of those I see around me have, been present when great Bills have been sent up from the other House, and I have often heard it remarked on those occasions by authorities on both sides, that in discussing these Bills which
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0543"/>
<col>1073</col>
have received so much attention from the other House, and in the papers before they come to us, we seem to be speaking as it were in a sort of atmosphere of unreality. Everything that ought to be said had been said, and all that remained for us to do was to repeat the wise and party sayings and clothe them with the best eloquence which was at our disposal. My Lords, that is not the case here to-night. We are debating a subject which has not yet been debated in the other House. We are debating the proposition of the noble Marquess opposite. The fundamental question which we are debating to-night is that of the Leader of the Opposition. I am not going to discuss the Budget. After very nearly a whole year's discussion in another place, after the multitudinous speeches that have been made upon it and the myriad of leading articles that have appeared in the newspapers about it, I do not think any noble Lord is anxious that I should go over these arguments again. But if there is such a noble Lord, I would remind him that I see in the Press we are shortly to have the benefit of another book on the subject, the author of which is no less a person than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. I do not want to minimise for a moment the responsibility of any vote that I am going to give with regard to the Budget, but I say without hesitation that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, the Budget was doomed and dead when the noble Marquess first tabled his Amendment and announced it to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
What then, my Lords, is our position? We are called upon to endorse or not to endorse an accomplished fact, as far as we sitting here are concerned. And what is that fact? That fact is the refusal of all Supplies to the Services of the country&#x2014;Supplies which have been voted by overwhelming majorities in the other House, and, of course, on the authority of the chosen Ministers of the Crown. That is surely a very serious position, the seriousness of which is, I am certain, acknowledged by noble Lords opposite as much as by myself. But perhaps noble Lords would add, and it is possible that I should agree, that in any certainly most exceptional case, a case which seemed to be not even dreamt of, almost a nightmare, circumstances might arise in which it would be the duty of a Second Chamber at all risks and under all conditions, to take the extreme course that I have spoken of; but surely my Lords, they
<col>1074</col>
would add at the same time, that this course could only be taken when the financial propositions of which I have dreamt constituted a vital and a permanent danger to the existence of the State. I will say at once, speaking honestly as an independent and a somewhat moderate member of the Liberal Party, that when the Budget was first brought in, there were provisions in it that have been in many eases most beneficially amended. There were provisions which if I had had a seat in the House which has the power of amendment, I should have done my best as a private member to alter or to delete.<lb/>
But, my Lords, this House has no power of amendment. I was rather surprised when I heard the noble Lord who last spoke say that the Commons could not send up a Bill which we were not to amend in any way. The noble Lord perhaps does not know that this House has no power of amendment. It has been relinquished by this House. It has been admitted by all authorities, and if you want us to mention the reason for it you will know perfectly well that when we pass an Amendment touching financial matters, and the Speaker rules it out of order on his own authority, we accept his ruling and we withdraw our Amendment. The noble Lord says this House has the power of amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03495"><member>SEVERAL NOBLE LORDS</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03496"><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: Well, someone else will probably point out where I am wrong. I say that this House has no power of amendment. The astute Statesmen who in 1860 for the first time sent up to this House the money Bills <i>en bloc</i> instead of sending them up Bill by Bill as they had done in the past, knew very well what they were about. In my humble opinion that revolution&#x2014;for in some ways it was a revolution in the relations of the two Houses&#x2014;removed from this House for ever practically the financial control which they had assumed in the past, except in the violent and extreme cases to which I have referred. I say that without hesitation, and moreover, I say that the situation which was then created in 1860 has been assented to, and been acquiesced in by all parties in the State, because since 1860 there have been many Conservative Governments in power, and many distinguished Conservative Chancellors of the Exchequer, and yet with their
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0544"/>
<col>1075</col>
majority in the other House they have never tried to reverse that practice which was instituted in 1860 of sending up these Financial Bills, and which in my opinion took away from this House its financial control.<lb/>
If I might make a homely illustration as to this action of taking away our financial control, I would ask you to consider what a surgeon would think if he was called in to operate upon a patient and was told that the only operation he could perform was to cut off his head. I do not think that that surgeon would consider that he was put in thorough surgical control of the full body of the patient. Yet that is our position with regard to Money Bills. I have heard it said, and I think somewhat loosely said, that there was a close analogy between the veto of the Crown, and the power which your Lordships have of rejecting Money Bills. In my humble opinion there is no analogy at all. In a Constitutional Monarchy the Sovereign acts by the advice of his Ministers who command a majority in another place, and it is perfectly obvious that if they bring in their Bills and pass them with their own majority, they will not advise the Sovereign to use his power of veto upon them. If I may be allowed to indulge in imagination for a moment, it does bring in some analogy as regards the position in which we are placed. I ask you to imagine, if it were possible, that a Ministry having a majority in another place, introduces some rather disputed measure. It passes the Lower House and the Upper House, and then at that moment the Ministry falls, but having known by the usual means, by the Press and by meetings, that the opinion of the country was against this measure which had received the assent of Parliament but not the assent of the Sovereign, the Prime Minister would take upon himself to advise the Sovereign to use his veto. I ask to be allowed to put that forward as an illustration, because the noble Marquess stands somewhat in the position of that Minister. He is advising your Lordships to use the veto which you had in your hands, but on what sole condition alone would a responsible Minister advise the Sovereign to take such a step? On one condition alone&#x2014;that he was quite certain that he had behind him the voice of the people, and that at the ensuing election the steps he had advocated would be endorsed by the electorate of this country.<lb/>
In taking the action which you are
<col>1076</col>
going to take, are you quite sure that you have behind you the voice of the people? If you have not, have you considered in what position you are placing this House, and what dangers you are raising for the Constitution? I have heard it said that if you had taken another course you would not have shown courage. No one on this or the other side of the House would accuse either the noble Marquess or his friends opposite of want of courage, but if I am not presumptuous I would venture to say that courageous as their action may be, they would have shown a greater and a higher courage if they had resisted the impetuous enthusiasm of their followers, and the daily diatribes of their Press, and had reverted to the calm, patient, prudent course which has characterised this House in all its great quarrels with the House of Commons since the days of the Duke of Wellington and Catholic Emancipation down to the passing of the Disestablishment Bill for Ireland. I think if they had taken that course they would have taken the wiser course; for if their action is not now confirmed by the country I think they will do great harm to the authority of this House, and if they have rushed into it not knowing what is going to happen, they have gone perilously near, if they have not actually attained, to the position of gambling with the Constitution of the country. If I sat on the other side of the House, and if I thought all the bad things of the Budget that every speaker, responsible or irresponsible, has laid to its charge during the course of this debate, I could not follow the noble Marquess into the Lobby, for I feel that it may be the action he has taken will not only arouse great political difficulties in the Constitution, but it may, under very conceivable circumstances, be a very serious danger to the Empire itself.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03498"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am unwilling to give a silent vote on this occasion. Having had for many years the honour of a seat in this House, as well as having been for several years in the other House of Parliament, I feel that it is of serious importance the vote a member has to give, but he must have perfectly good reasons for the vote he is prepared to give. I do not propose at the present moment to embark on the whole question
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0545"/>
<col>1077</col>
of the constitutional rules of this House for that has been freely discussed before. What I take exception to, however, is the remark made by Lord Burghclere just before the House adjourned that this House had no power whatever to amend any Money Bill. I believe when any tax is put on perfectly separate from any other, it is competent that this House should have the power of amending that tax as it pleases. But there are in this Budget several matters of contention and injustice, most of which have been alluded to.<lb/>
There are two points to which I should like to direct your Lordships' special attention because in them is started the idea of tracing the source from which the income comes. I allude, in the first place, to the question of Royalties on Minerals. A royalty unfortunately is frequently called rent whereas really it is payment on capital. The owner sells absolutely the mineral, coal, iron, clay or whatever it may be, at so much a ton to the purchaser, and on that he has paid for many years, and now pays, his Income Tax. At the present moment that amounts to 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in the pound. Under this new Budget, if it became law, he would have to pay practically another shilling Income Tax on that same article, and if the amount it produced happened to bring him within the scope of the Super Tax he would practically have to pay 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in the pound Income Tax&#x2014;really that is what it comes to&#x2014;on one source of his income. I would ask your Lordships and the country is that a fair method of taxation?<lb/>
But to my mind the most dangerous point in the Budget is the question how far the present Government has mixed up Imperial and Local Taxation? It is proposed that one-half the money collected from a certain number of taxes should go towards the relief of rates. Up to the present time the ratepayers have always known that the money they contributed to the rates was spent on their locality and was of use to that locality. They could see for themselves what was the benefit, and locally elected bodies have had the power of criticising and checking the expenditure and seeing that the rates to which they themselves contributed were properly expended. As I gather from the present Budget the money that is disposed to the rates will not go back to the locality, or at all events the amount it has subscribed
<col>1078</col>
will not. Take the case of ratepayers in the Midland counties. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer should so choose their money might be spent on afforestation in Scotland, or in Devonshire, or anywhere else. As a rule ratepayers all over the country feel that whatever they contribute to the rates should be locally applied and locally spent. I believe that clause was put in with the view of bribing municipalities to accept these terms, but I ask your Lordships does it not lend itself to still greater danger in the future? There may be these sums at the disposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and which he may give to any locality he likes to prefer. I have no wish to make any remarks about any future Chancellor of the Exchequer, but we all know there is such a thing as political pressure, and I have grave doubts myself&#x2014;I don't know whether it is put in the Bill&#x2014;whether that money so disposed is under the control of Parliament at all. I think that is a very important question, that there should be large sums of money which the Chancellor of the Exchequer may have at his disposal to suit different localities according to their different complexion, possibly without the control of Parliament.<lb/>
I now come to the more serious question, that is with regard to the vote this House is going to give early next week. No member can approach it without feeling a sense of the gravity of the vote he has to give, but at the same time we must look at the various remarks that are made about your Lordships' House by speakers on the other side. We have had several violent communications and threats of extreme measures possibly through His Majesty's Government; but there is one statement which appeared in Tuesday's papers from a speech by the First Lord of the Admiralty in which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They were going to teach the House of Lords their last final lesson. It was their duty to bow to the will of the country."</quote>
I take it by the vote we are going to give we wish to find out what is the will of the country, and I do not see on what ground, considering the terms of the Amendment of the noble Marquess, Mr. McKenna has any right to object to the course that is being taken. What your Lordships' House propose to do is to test whether the will of the country is in favour of this Budget or not. I think myself that is not an unreasonable line for your Lordships'
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0546"/>
<col>1079</col>
House to take. We have had various stories told us with regard to the Budget&#x2014;how far it would benefit different classes and different people; but nobody on the other side of the House has yet ventured to get up and say it would seriously diminish the great evil of unemployment. There is no doubt the additional taxes they are putting on agricultural land must naturally decrease employment in agricultural districts. I do not take the cheerful view which the Minister of Agriculture took last night, because after all is said and done he cannot prove to your Lordships' House that by putting additional taxes on the land, no matter in what form, it will conduce to agricultural employment in the country.<lb/>
What is the advice which is given to your Lordships' House? I regret the speech of my noble friend below the Gangway, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, because he disapproved of the Budget but he did not drive it to its logical conclusion, that is that it must be submitted to the will of the country. I hope and trust your Lordships' House will not be induced to follow his advice, because it has not always proved successful in the past. I would say with regard to the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery, that it strikes me the advice he gave is hardly worthy of his great position and his great oratorical powers which we all acknowledge and admire. What does it come to? He disapproves of the Budget in every possible way. He said it would bring, practically, disaster and ruin on the country, yet he advised your Lordships' House to let it pass; so that the country may suffer for six months from it and possibly thereby eject from power the authors of the Budget. It does not seem to me a worthy position for your Lordships' House to occupy&#x2014;that you should let the people of this country suffer injury and ruin when you believe and know in your own hearts it will bring upon them both these disasters.<lb/>
We are the only Second Chamber at present, and I do not believe for a moment that the country wishes to have an uncontrolled House of Commons. The country looks to the Second Chamber to save it from having all these measures thrust upon it which in your Lordships' thoroughly determined opinion will bring disaster upon it. I hold, therefore, without any hesitation that we shall be false to our duty
<col>1080</col>
as the Second Chamber of the country if we do not give the people the chance of passing their opinion on what we honestly believe&#x2014;and I feel sure many noble Lords on the other side who may vote the other way believe&#x2014;is fraught with grave risk and danger to the country. We must do our duty as a Second Chamber. We are driven to it. It is not our seeking. We are driven to it by the action of His Majesty's Government, and I feel it is our bounden duty to give the country an opportunity of recording its opinion on a Budget which all of us who vote with the noble Marquess, believe to be fraught with such danger and ruin to the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03499"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the speech of the most rev. Primate last night it may seem to your Lordships somewhat rash on the part of a rural Bishop like myself who can claim no special influence in the House to take part in this Debate. The most rev. Primate, as will be remembered, with his unfailing consideration for his brother Bishops, and his unfailing courtesy, allowed it to be assumed that we should all retain our individual liberty in the matter, yet he informed the House that he and his Grace the Archbishop of York and the majority of his brother Bishops had deliberately decided to take no part in this debate or in the division, presumably leaving to Caesar the things that are C&#x00E6;sar's. I cannot but feel some reluctance in stepping aside from that decision, but my reluctance to do so was much lessened by the reason that was given. The main reason given by his Grace was that they understood the division on this great question on this critical occasion would be a division on strictly party lines. I hold it is a very great misfortune if, on a very critical constitutional occasion like this, it should even be understood that the division was going to be on party lines.<lb/>
I desire, therefore, for myself and the two or three others who may act as I do, to say that on this and such like matters we owe no party allegiance. We give our vote on one side or the other and we speak according to our convictions as independent members of this House, and because of the function which we feel we are called to discharge as having the honour of membership in this great Assembly. If his Grace had been here
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0547"/>
<col>1081</col>
I might have ventured on a suggestion, and that is that it would be perfectly easy for the two Archbishops and all my brother Bishops who agree with their view, to prove conclusively on this occasion that the division was not on party lines if they would simply join my brother of Birmingham and myself that we may all go into the same lobby in support of the Budget. I desire your indulgence for a few minutes because of what I conceive to be the function of a Bishop here on such an occasion. If we who are Bishops have any special function at all in this House I venture to think that it is that we may speak and vote here on behalf of the multitudinous poor whenever occasion arises&#x2014;a part of the population which is very numerous and which is not largely represented in this place. I hold that one of the chief functions of a Bishop here is to be, according to his reasonable convictions, the advocate and the procurator of those poorer classes whom he represents more especially than any other member of the House.<lb/>
It is for this reason that I desire to say a few words explaining why I give my support to this Budget, and more particularly why on this occasion of constitutional crisis&#x2014;for I think I may venture so to call it&#x2014;I deeply deplore the dangerous revolutionary course which your Lordships are invited to take. I support this Budget for a very simple reason; because as was very well stated a few days ago by one whom I consider our greatest living political economist in England, it is a Social Welfare Budget and based on sound finance. In spite of all I have heard from the other side during this long debate I am still convinced that this is the right view of the Budget, that it is a Social Welfare Budget and based on sound finance. At any rate as an old student of political economy I am well content to take my stand on the verdict of Professor Marshall in this matter.<lb/>
But, on the other hand, what does it really mean to reject this Bill? Unless I am mistaken it will do a good deal towards letting loose and stirring up and stimulating the dangerous spirit of revolution in the masses of our people. And none can pay any attention to European history without seeing that there is a danger wherever you artificially stimulate, as you will be doing on this occasion, that spirit of revolution, of angry revolution, whether it be dormant or not already. As your Lordships know
<col>1082</col>
very well, with the spread of education everywhere our life inevitably becomes more democratic. You cannot expect an educated democracy and their leaders to remain content with the survivals which represent the present constitution of our society. You must recognize that in connection with this growing intelligence and knowledge there is a growing sense of impatience, and a democracy under those circumstances, if you rouse its spirit of revolt and stimulate it by such opposition as you are giving, may become very dangerous. That is what I dread as one of the results of this action. That is why I wish this Budget to be passed in the usual way, as a protection and safeguard against the spirit of revolution, and that is why I would make an appeal to your Lordships on the Opposition Benches, if the opinion of such a person as myself were likely to be of any avail.<lb/>
Well then, I give a very hearty support to this Budget as a Budget of Social Welfare based on sound finance, but I have freely to confess while doing so that I cannot do it without a word of protest. I feel that the Chancellor of the Exchequer deserves the very highest credit for his Budget, given the necessity for it, but I am inclined to protest against the alleged necessity for all this immense expenditure year by year. Our bloated Estimates, and not ours only, but the bloated estimates for military armaments all over Europe&#x2014;why, on any dispassionate consideration in the twentieth century of Christian history, such competitive instruments for destructive purposes area discredit to European civilization, and more than that, they are a continual menace to European peace; and, as we know very well, they are a constant hindrance to all social progress and reform. But your Lordships who oppose this Budget cannot join me in this protest because you and your friends are more responsible than the Government for these bloated Estimates.<lb/>
And yet I do not entirely acquit His Majesty's Government from some blame in this matter. Four years ago many of our hopes were raised about peace, retrenchment, and reform, and we had some very noble utterances, one in particular by the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in which he asked what nobler r&#x00F4;le could our country have than to place herself at the head of a League of Peace so that arbitration might succeed the competitive armaments. He said he looked for this at the fitting
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0548"/>
<col>1083</col>
time. We are waiting, a good many of us, hoping to see that fitting time; but in the meanwhile I personally should like to hear our leading Statesmen on both sides declaring their earnest desire for this happier time in more articulate terms than they are in the habit of using.<lb/>
Turning for one moment to the Budget itself, as I have listened to this Debate it has been borne in upon my mind that your objections to it are mainly three. Your Lordships, not all I am happy to think, but many of your Lordships oppose it because you desire Tariff Reform. Many again oppose it because they object to the Land Taxes and Land Valuation; and Land Valuation necessarily follows the taxes. Your third objection is because you take the side of the Liquor Traffic in this matter. Well, I will not presume to enter into details on all these matters; I will only ask your indulgence while I say a word on each of them. As to Tariff Reform I am old enough to remember what men called "the hungry forties" in the North country where I was brought up. It is engraven in my memory what a dismal and wretched time it was for the poorer people in this country, and not only for the labouring classes but for the farmers and many others. I desire not to see again anything like that. If a majority of the electors of England were as old as I am and had the same memories of that dismal and wretched time, there would be no Tariff Reform. But I venture to say with regard to Tariff Reform, which is but a new name for the old Protection, that it is a gamble with the necessaries of life. I would challenge any noble Lords opposite to say that there are not two fundamental objections to it. One of these objections is that while no doubt it will make many of the rich richer&#x2014;the gospel of the millionaire&#x2014;yet it will sink the poor into deeper poverty. All experience shows that when you look into it. And the other objection is this, as experience again teaches us if we choose to read contemporary history, it will honeycomb our political life with intrigue and corruption from which it is now happily free.<lb/>
I pass from Tariff Reform to the Land Taxes and Valuation. I cannot but feel that all through this discussion there has been an endeavour in many directions to confuse the issue. This Budget as I understand it&#x2014;I say this with all deference&#x2014;will be of benefit to agriculture in the long run. Purely agricultural land will gain by
<col>1084</col>
it. Our farmers should recognise that and so should landlords. And with regard to urban land, who is there who really dares to assert that the greater part of the increment on such land is not the real property of the community? In my own city only yesterday we had to buy an acre of land for a boys' school, and after much difficulty we obtained an acre of land for &#x00A3;1,200&#x2014;a small city, remember. And on turning to the rate book what do we find? That acre of land has been hitherto valued, as I am informed, for rating purposes, at about &#x00A3;6. Is it not reasonable that the rate-paying community which has added to the increment of that land by industry, by enterprise, by sacrifice, should have a fair share of that increment? I venture to think it is hardly decent for owners of such land to stand up in either House of Parliament and oppose this tax.<lb/>
I turn for one moment to the Liquor Taxes. Now the liquor trade is a dangerous trade and it is doing a good deal to debauch the population of England. It has far too long enjoyed a very cheap monopoly from the State, having an annual licence at almost a peppercorn rent in many cases. And now, forsooth, we are told by the friends of the Liquor Trade&#x2014;and your Lordships by your action, I am afraid, are supporting it; I am surprised it should be so&#x2014;that we ought not to raise the rent, that it ought not to be introduced into an annual Budget. Is there any one who will seriously say to us, as we have been told outside, that taxes which are accepted as just and reasonable in New York and Massachusetts, or one of our Colonies, are nothing short of spoliation and iniquity here at home? The noble Earl, the late Prime Minister, a few years ago uttered a prophecy which has become famous, that if we did not take care this trade&#x2014;and many members of it are constantly reminding us that their trade is their politics&#x2014;would throttle the community. I begin to fear that this prophecy is being fulfilled.<lb/>
My Lords, I have done, and I will conclude with one word of respectful appeal. I believe, as I said before, that this much abused Budget is really a protection and safeguard against the upraising and the stimulating of an angry revolutionary spirit in the masses of the people, while on the other hand the noble Marquess's motion, what is it? It is revolutionary in its essence, and in its consequences it will be no less revolutionary. I can hardly believe that its origin is really
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0549"/>
<col>1085</col>
to be traced to the mind of the noble Marquess himself. Admiring, as we have had so many occasions to do, his high political instinct, his dispassionate approach to all the great questions of State, I cannot believe that the origin of this movement was in that mind, nursed in such noble historical and constitutional traditions. I am inclined to believe that people outside are right who say we must look to another quarter for its origin, and that the remarkable man, the highly distinguished man, who is now your guide, philosopher and friend in this matter, but was not always so, had a good deal to do with the origin of this motion. [Cries of, "Name."] I think the record of the history of later years in England has proved to the hilt that that highly distinguished man has been revolutionary in spirit at every stage of his career, and that being so your Lordships in your constitutional position, as I venture to think, could hardly take a more unsafe guide. Several speakers have urged on the noble Marquess the desirability of pressing through this motion uncaring consequences, none more so than the noble Viscount, Lord Milner. But it is not the first time, I think you might do well to remember, that the noble Viscount has pressed for strong measures on the noble Marquess and his friends. Let us hope that this advice will prove less disastrous than the advice given on that other occasion. In this House we are too apt to forget the people of England outside, but can any of us really imagine that the people of England will forget, that they are so degenerate as to forget, the great historical struggles for their fundamental liberties, and above all for the liberty and the power of the purse which cost so much and which we have long held so dear? Can you imagine that these people at the present time are at all likely to forget, or are in any degree likely to surrender these fundamental liberties under the thin disguise, the very thin disguise, of such a phrase as this Amendment?<lb/>
No, my Lords, you may send this Budget to the country; but, living among the people, having grown up among the people and come out from among them, I have some knowledge of their fundamental feelings and ideas; and my belief is that the answer will come back to your Lordships in very plain English, and I fear it may come in tome form which you may regret. The answer will come, I think, something like this&#x2014;
<col>1086</col>
<quote>"Never again, never again, in this country shall the fundamental liberties of the people be endangered by any privileged class."</quote>
It is not the answer I fear when I regard with something like dread your Lordships' action, or proposed action. It is not the answer that I fear so much as the storm and the tumult and the class antagonisms and the strife and the bitterness for which you are making yourselves responsible to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03500"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the question of the right of your Lordships' House to reject this measure has been dealt with and I wish to allude to the remarks made by the Lord Chancellor in this connection. He said that constitutionally we were wrong to do so, and he referred to the constitutional aspect and the legal, saying the constitutional point of view was more elastic and less rigid than that of the law. Now, as far as I can gather he wishes to claim that the constitutional situation should be made rigid in respect of our action, while in regard to the Government there should be allowed full elasticity. Well, after that very telling quotation of Lord Salisbury last evening, I do not think it necessary to have any better authority for our rights in this matter than that of the Lord Chancellor himself, but I think the feature of the evening's debate has been the declaration of Lord Balfour of Burleigh for whose judgment and experience I, like every other Member of the House, have the most profound respect. He drew an alarming picture of what would happen if the Amendment now before your Lordships' House is acted upon. These views have been supported by the speech of the right rev. Prelate just delivered. I confess I do not share their alarms in the slightest. We were told the other evening, by Lord Russell, that time after time your Lordships' House had thwarted the will of the people of the country. I think that statement in itself goes to disprove the idea that when we had rejected measures from the other House we had done so against the will of the people, but that we had correctly interpreted what were the wishes of the people. It would be perfectly impossible for a House constituted as this House is time after time, year after year, to impose a barrier to the wishes of the people. In some indirect way we do really represent in some degree what are the wishes of the people.<lb/>
I believe that during the last quarter of a century the feeling of the public towards
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0550"/>
<col>1087</col>
your Lordships' House has grown favourably. Since the last great Franchise Act, whenever we have ventured to oppose any important measure coming from the other House, we have always been threatened, but I consider that if Mr. Gladstone with all his power, prestige and authority failed in his attack upon this House, I do not think it will be the present Government who will bring the walls of this House about our ears. I believe this, too, that the people of this country have been so long accustomed to engage themselves in politics that they have such an intuitive appreciation of constitutional government that year by year, as the House of Commons seems to be degenerating in its procedure and practice, so there is a growing respect for your Lordships' House. It may be an unconscious act, but I believe that your Lordships' House is responding to that feeling. Since I have been a Member of this House I have spent a considerable time abroad. When I came home two or three years ago I was enormously impressed by the change that had come over this House. Formerly the Debates were stereotyped and confined practically to the two Front Benches. I came back and found the attendance regular; I found Members, young and old, interested in and participating in the Debates; and I believe intuitively they are qualifying themselves to play a more important part in the government of the country than they had previously done.<lb/>
I do not wish to go into many details of the measure before us, but the right rev. Prelate has just informed us that in his view the Budget is a "Social Welfare Budget," "a philanthropic Budget." I do not believe in any Government indulging in philanthropy. It is not their mission and they almost invariably fail. It is well enough that out of the ordinary reforms of the country a certain proportion of them may be devoted to what we term philanthropy. We have very recently had presented to Parliament a report of a most important Commission on the Poor Law. It is one of the primary and rudimentary duties of any Government to look after the very extreme poor of the country. What is the general result of that report? What may be gleaned from it? Why, even in this rudimentary duty the Government have hopelessly failed in the past. This is said to be a Social Welfare Budget. Well, if you had, say, a Military Budget would
<col>1088</col>
you not get an expression of opinion upon it from your most competent Generals or those versed in military subjects? Suppose you had some Budget connected with the Crown Colonies, would you not get their opinion? As to this Social Welfare Budget I ask whether there are not plenty of earnest devoted workers in this country who give up their lives to philanthropy? That being so you would only reasonably expect that these men and women who lead these laborious lives would have made their voice heard when this great measure came before them to help them in their toil, but have we heard a single word from the leading philanthropists in this country? I certainly have heard none. You have good Societies like the Charity Organisation Society. Have they given any support to this Budget? You have great Friendly Societies whose mission is to help the people in time of need. Have they made any representation in support of the Budget? You have your great Hospitals which directly administer to the suffering poor. Have their directors or managers said a single word in favour of this Social Welfare Budget? Not one of them. Why? Because they are not affected by a partisan spirit in the matter. Their concern is with the strict purpose of trying to relieve the necessitous poor. They have no political aims, and they know well enough too that were such the case, not to try to administer philanthropy by the State, because it would invariably fail. It must needs be so. A Government must work on strict lines. They cannot discriminate. If they do they are very apt to become lax, and perhaps lead to corruption.<lb/>
Well, the Lord Chancellor drew a very dismal picture of the condition of the lower working classes at the present time. For myself, I believe that he overdrew that picture. I believe that year after year there is some improvement in the general welfare of the masses, but if that is not so, I only say his description is a most terrible indictment of that paternal legislation which has been a marked feature of the last half century. I consider the result of these attempts to cure all evils by legislation is very often that where you manage to heal one sore you open two sores elsewhere. But there is one particular aspect of this question to which the noble and learned Lord is never weary of drawing your Lordships' attention. It is what he terms the serious diminution of the agricultural 
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0551"/>
<col>1089</col>
population. I am not going into the question of the general revenue of the landowners connected with the Budget, but I wish to say a word upon this point because it has so often been put before your Lordships.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord seems to forget that this tendency of country people to move into the towns is not peculiar to this country. I believe in every country in the world, and every new country with countless acres of fertile land to be cultivated, you will see the people congregated in the towns. I need not now enter into the reasons for this, but if the noble Lord had been present he might have derived some solace from one consideration. I know it in the part of the country in which I live. Small villages have disappeared and the people have migrated to the towns and the mines. My view is that they go into the towns and engage in industrial occupations because there is suitable employment. There is also a movement of people from the crowded districts to take up life on the borders of even the smallest country town in which you see springing up small residences, villas and detached houses. These are the people who have made their money and become prosperous in the towns. In mining villages you will find that even miners possess their own houses. I contend that by a natural process far better than any you can devise by a legislative system there is a continual movement into the towns, and then when better off, people come out of the towns and enjoy better conditions of life and fresh air.<lb/>
I shall be informed that this has nothing to do with the rural population. I do not know what the noble Lord would like to see. Would he like to see two men working a plot of land which could be cultivated by one man? This migration is due solely to natural causes, and if two men were to do the work of one man would he like to see the wage obtained by one man divided between the two? Or, if not, would he expect the State to step in and supplement the wages and provide the men with decent conditions of life? There is the noble Earl sitting opposite whose care is the Department of Agriculture. He has been in Australia. I wonder if he has ever visited any of those communities set up by Government, communal communities, so that one man should not have any advantage over another, but should be
<col>1090</col>
strictly settled on the land under conditions very favourable to everyone. What do you see there? You find, perhaps, one or two men remaining; otherwise derelicts, weeds everywhere, land lapsing again into the bush from which it was originally carved. Yet these were people who were settled on the land under every condition of prosperity, land provided free, houses provided, implements supplied, and so on, and yet they have failed. While touching on this question he referred to the unearned increment. In Australia he will find a community who are living strictly under Socialistic principles&#x2014;that is they have no religion, they have no property; they are the aborigines of Australia. I see the right rev. Prelate smile. I am not taking an exaggerated view at all. These are not degraded people in the slightest, but men of intelligence and fine physique. But ask anybody who works among them to try to save them from the civilisation that is pressing on them. What would you be told is the essential difficulty in trying to preserve them? First, the absence of any strong religious belief, and secondly, the absence of any knowledge of the rights of property. These are the two principles which have to be inculcated in them. There you have an instance of what pure Socialism is. Communism is from Socialism. It is a parasite which drops off that which created it. It is not initiative; it is purely destructive.<lb/>
We are told this is not Socialism, but that is ridiculous. The Socialists in this country and the Socialists on the Continent hail the Budget as a big instalment in the carrying out of their Socialistic principles. There is one reason which has been given very forcibly why it is sought to heap so many taxes upon the land, and that is because the land cannot escape them. It is quite true. Capital in other forms does escape, whether it be the Death Duties or the Super Tax in regard to the Income Tax. That telling speech of Lord Revelstoke showed very clearly how capital does manage to escape. In my own experience I know it. I have come across two foreigners, one a very distinguished British Indian subject, a man of considerable wealth, who told me he was taking care to withdraw his money from this country. So also I heard a Spanish gentleman, who has a large connection here, say. Moreover, some months ago I was told by a Banker abroad that he was simply being inundated by requests
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0552"/>
<col>1091</col>
from this country as to how people could so place their accounts that they might escape the taxation of this country. I quite agree that luxury is a very bad thing, and there is a great deal of luxury in this country, but I do not think that those who are living in luxury are the landed classes of this country. I think the money will be found to be chiefly derived from foreign sources, from our kinsmen on the other side of the Atlantic. Certainly for the most part it does not come from incomes derived in this country. It may be you will find this luxurious system will disappear, but I do not think so. I think what is more likely to happen is that these taxes, the Super Tax and graduated taxation, which may be theoretically very fair but may be unwise, will cause capital to take flight out of this country. It is taking flight, but the luxury will remain here. Therefore you will be beset by both evils. Lord St. David's last evening seemed to be quite indifferent as to whether capital was driven abroad or took itself abroad. I don't quite know what he wants. I suppose he wishes to see the country reduced to having a prairie value. It may be a very sound state of affairs. Money and happiness are not necessarily co-existent; but I don't think anybody has yet put forward as a practical proposition that it is desirable to impoverish the sources of the wealth of the country. I believe there is a perfectly sound maxim that any system of taxation, if it is permanently or continuously applied, should fall fairly on all people in the country, but it must not be liable to violent fluctuations and changes.<lb/>
And it is the worst feature of the Budget that it proposes to tax certain classes and sections for the benefit of others. This will involve changes year by year. You are simply trying to get as much money as you can out of small sections of the people. I quite agree with what the right rev. Prelate described as the evils; similar evils will result from the imposition of the Budget. You get change and uncertainty and you draw into politics a number of people who are ordinarily engaged in commerce or trade who find themselves liable to be injured and are desirous of obtaining some benefit under a system of high protection&#x2014;trying to obtain either protection for themselves or benefit for themselves. Thereby you run the danger of introducing a system of corruption. I deplore the Budget because I regard it as a system, or an attempt to set up a system,
<col>1092</col>
of a kind of philanthropy based on the destruction of our present financial system. I think it is extremely unfortunate that it has been introduced at the present time. I am no believer in the hostile intention of any particular Power, but, as Lord Cromer pointed out the other evening, there are very disquieting features that demand that at home we should have strength and calmness. The present Government have done nothing in this direction. They have done everything to promote disquietude instead of trying to instil a sense of order and stability which are the factors absolutely essential for the proper conduct of affairs at the headquarters of the world-wide Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03501"><member>THE MARQUESS OF NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened to the noble Lord with pleasure. We must feel he is looking at affairs in this country with a comparatively new eye, instead of the way in which we regard affairs in the country with a vision which is perhaps a little dulled by the constant habit of microscopic observations. We recognise that he has fulfilled high service abroad. He conies back to us and the first thing he tells us is that this House has improved. As he has returned during the time when a Liberal Government is in power I think that we on this side of the House may accept that as a compliment. He also said, at least so I understood, that the Government is guilty of philanthropy. I do not quite understand why anybody should defend himself against an accusation of philanthropy. So far as I am concerned, the only reason I ever took part in politics or entered into political life was from philanthropic motives. I do not use that term as if I were better than anybody else, but I do use the term as one who sees that the chief object of a Government should be to do what they can to better the condition of the men who live around us. After all, the noble Lord has given us an interesting speech of his experience in one direction, but has hardly dealt with the vital issue before the House at the present moment.<lb/>
There has been raised a new issue with which the House has never had to deal before, with which the country has never had to deal before, and we have to deal with a new claim on the part of your Lordships' House. The new claim is the right of the Opposition in this House to cause by their action a General Election. We are perfectly well accustomed to the power which this House has claimed and exercised of dealing with
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0553"/>
<col>1093</col>
Liberal legislation whenever Liberal legislation is brought forward, either by rejecting it or by altering it in such a way that it is impossible for any self-respecting Liberal Ministers to accept the alterations. But to-night and during this debate the Amendment which has been moved by the noble Marquess has raised an additional question and claimed a fresh power.<lb/>
Now I should like to ask the noble Marquess a question, which I am perfectly certain he will not answer, and it is this. If this Liberal Government had introduced this Finance Bill in the first year of their existence as a Government, would the Opposition in this House have rejected that Bill by a large majority? If they had introduced it in the second year, would the Opposition have opposed and rejected it? Is it a question of the lapse of time or a question of the Finance Bill which we are deciding? I do not believe for one moment that the noble Marquess or any responsible noble Lord on the opposite side would have risen to reject the Finance Bill if it had been introduced in the year after the Liberal Party had come in with a very gigantic majority, when the whole flood of the tide had gone in their favour and swept them in and swept you out. If you say "Yes"; if it was so iniquitous, if, according to the language of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, it was so unclean, if it was so wicked that it would have been rejected the first year, in spite of the gigantic majority, then we can understand what the claim of the Opposition is. It is that, whenever the Liberal Party come into office, whatever may be the majority, whatever may be the feeling of the country, if a measure they bring in is distasteful to the Opposition, they will reject it. On the other hand, I do not believe for one moment that you would have rejected this Bill in the first or in the second year of the existence of the present Government. But you do move to reject it in the fourth year. A change has come about, the change being that, owing to certain circumstances, certain signs, you think that the present Government is no longer able to get a majority. I wish the cheer had been more universal on the other side. It was only one or two who were incautious enough to cheer that remark. If you still admit that you are rejecting this Finance Bill because you think you are going to get a majority in the country, then all the speeches that have been delivered by noble

Lords on the Opposition side are unreal speeches, and the only reason why you are objecting to this Finance Bill is because you think you will be able to place yourselves in power and turn out those who are in power at present.<lb/>
I am anxious, if I can, to place before noble Lords opposite the knowledge of what some of us see is going on in this House and what will probably be the result. A gradual change has come about. Your majority has grown larger and larger through no fault of your own. The Liberals have tried at times to feed the minority in this House by making Liberal Peers. I look round now and I wonder how many of the Liberal Peers who have been made Peers in the last twenty years are still sitting on this side of the House. You have gradually absorbed them for reasons which I cannot state, except that, I imagine, in some cases they have got what they want, and, having got what they want, they prefer to sit on the other side, and, perhaps, in other cases they have not got what they want, and therefore they have changed to the other side of the House. We have suffered from a gradual loss. Yes, and we admit it. We are in a small, weak minority in this House, and that time after time, owing to measures that we have brought forward, we have lost some of those who have hitherto supported us. We are quite alive to the fact but that does not change the situation that in this House, the Second Chamber, there has come about such a state of affairs that we have a gigantic political majority permanently here, representing whom? Whose policy or what? A gigantic majority that at the present moment are using their power solely with the idea of defeating Liberal legislation, defeating Liberal ideals, whose sole idea at the present moment is to get rid of a Liberal Government. Will any one deny that? And with the idea, the mistaken idea, that they themselves will soon enjoy office.<lb/>
I have once before spoken in this House and made a gentle appeal, on behalf of a very small Bill, against party tactics. Nobody knows better than the noble Marquess who moved the Amendment what party tactics really mean. We know perfectly well the forces that are being brought into action in order to force the Opposition into taking the course they have taken. It is no secret that there has been every influence&#x2014;political influence&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0554"/>
<col>1095</col>
brought to bear upon the noble Marquess and those around him to make them, perhaps against their will, reject the Finance Bill of the Government. The result is that, with a general election that returned the Liberal Government by a large majority we have had four short years during which Liberal legislation has been recklessly vetoed. We have now almost the new claim to reject the Finance Bill, and we have the further additional claim, according to the words of the Amendment, that any moment the Opposition in this House may cause a General Election. We are to have the rejection of legislation and the rejection of taxation. At this moment it seems to me that it would be better if wiser counsels had prevailed. There are one or two independent members of this House. I am not one of them, but I recognise to the full the value of the fact that we have some independent members. They are very few indeed. Every independent member of this House who has spoken has recommended that this Amendment should not be accepted.<lb/>
I do not for one moment imagine that I shall influence a single vote, but I do think I might appeal to the House that the views that have been put forward by moderate men should be carefully considered before we come to an ultimate decision. We are asked at the present moment to take a step which is in antagonism to immemorial custom. We are asked, in the language of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who, after all, cannot be considered an extreme man, to enter upon a gambling transaction. Can any of us foretell what the result of the General Election will be? I daresay you have been advised that you have a chance at the General Election, but no noble Lord opposite will venture to say that it is a certainty. We are asked to throw into the melting-pot some of the best parts of our constitutional system, and to enter upon a great war which will last, perhaps, for many years, but can only have in the end one result.<lb/>
I have hitherto only spoken on the constitutional aspect, but I feel that it would be almost cowardly, although that aspect is the most important in my mind, not to say something as regards the Budget itself and what the Budget proposes to do. In the first place we are asked to tax "the trade." It does seem to me a most unfortunate thing that, whenever there is a
<col>1096</col>
question in regard to the taxation of the licensed trade, the whole Conservative Party should unite in one solid body on its behalf. We who have been in the House of Commons and have fought many an election know quite well the power of the trade. Noble Lords who have not gone through contested political elections will hardly be aware of the power the public-house has. I am quite ready to admit that at General Election time, or during by-elections, it is a valuable asset to any political party to have the public-house on their side. But it is a very disreputable asset, and I am astonished sometimes that the Conservative Party should have such a very strong political alliance with the trade, whose houses, certainly during political elections, are allowed to be used in a manner of which none of us would approve. It is, however, the other taxation that I imagine forms the chief difficulty of this Budget. There is the question of the taxation of land. I happen to be one who has urban property as well as property in the country. I am not at all anxious to pay more than I need. I think all Budgets are detestable. I think the amount of money we spend is much too large. But we have to look facts in the face, and I see at the present moment that there is a serious demand in the country for a large sum of money which must be raised somehow. Personally I thoroughly approve of the principle that the largest share of the taxation should be placed on the shoulders of those who are best able to bear it. I do not say for one moment that it is a good thing for the country. I think this gigantic expenditure is a bad thing for the country. We are face to face with circumstances which none of us can overlook. In the first place both Parties pledged themselves to grant Old Age Pensions. Both Parties must carry out that pledge. It will not matter which Party is in power, that pledge will be carried out.<lb/>
Then we heard the speech which was delivered by my noble friend, Earl Cromer. I do not take, perhaps, quite so gloomy a view as he does of our position in the world and the dangers which surround us, but I acknowledge, as a Liberal, that I think it is the duty of our country to place our two defensive forces, the Navy and the Army, in a perfectly safe condition, so that we may depend upon them in any circumstances, and certainly that, above all, our Navy should be supreme, in order
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0555"/>
<col>1097</col>
that we may fulfil our duty to the Empire for which we are responsible. But that means spending money. Money must be provided, and when some noble Lords opposite, who are Imperialists just as I am an Imperialist, say that this revenue which we see foreshadowed in the Finance Bill is something very bad, I feel that that prospective revenue is the one thing that this country requires, for we owe a large debt as regards social reform and we must put our Navy and our Army into efficient order.<lb/>
My Lords, I feel that it is almost a waste of time even to speak about this matter, because it is practically already decided, but I do think noble Lords opposite ought to consider what really takes place when Liberals are in power and when Conservatives are in power. When the Conservatives are in power and Bills are sent up from the House of Commons, they are received here by the majority&#x2014;a gigantic majority&#x2014;with content. They are passed almost without discussion. They are hardly ever amended. But when Liberal measures are sent up here we know the fate of them even before they arrive. When the Conservatives are in power your Lordships send, as it were, blank cheques to the House of Commons to be filled in as the House of Commons likes. When the Liberals are in power you refuse payment. Is it possible that a Second Chamber can go on under these conditions? Is it possible that the people of a free country will always submit to this fact, that if they return Liberals to power, the Liberals have no voice and no power? Do you think it is really the popular wish of the present moment that the House of Lords should be supreme and that the House of Commons should be powerless?&#x2014;for, after all, we are gradually getting to that. We are to be supreme. We are to reject measures. We are to mutilate measures. If we pass measures we pass them, not because we approve of them, but because for some political reason we think it is better to pass them. We are going in the future always to say that if a Finance Bill does not suit us we will reject it and we will have a General Election. We are claiming to say that the Government, on any question that comes, most go to the people. We are laying claim to a power which no free people will stand for one moment. You are going to the country now and you are going to place yourselves in a position from
<col>1098</col>
which you will never be able to withdraw until the people have declared that you shall not have the power which you profess is your right at the present moment to exercise.<lb/>
I feel the seriousness of the position; I feel the danger of the position. No one is more alive than I am to the social unrest existing in our country. I do not believe that any noble Lord in this House has ever done what I have done. I have gone among the Socialists and spoken to them against Socialism. I have gone amongst them where I was the only one who was anti-Socialist. I have gone amongst those who are the most extreme and the most determined. I have had no fear of them in the past, and I will not say I have any fear of them in the present. But if anything is to increase Socialism, if anything is to give Socialists power, it will be the action which this House is going to take on the Finance Bill. You are playing into the hands of the extreme party and against the moderate party; and I believe that your only reason for taking this step is that you think you will be able to get rid of the Government to which you are politically opposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03502"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, nobody will question the sincerity of the noble Marquess in supporting the principles of this Budget, because, if I am not mistaken, he is one of the persons who is largely affected by it. But I regret that the motives which he has imputed to Peers upon this side of the House are of so uncomplimentary a nature that I do not think it worth while to comment upon them. As for the enquiries which he put to the Opposition Front Bench, they are of a purely hypothetical nature, and as to the question as to why so many Liberal Peers eventually change their politics on attaining a place in this Chamber, that is a question which has perplexed many persons besides himself and will probably continue to perplex other people to the end of time. Although I, personally, am unable to appreciate the moral beautie of this Budget, and although, unlike the right rev. Prelate, I am unable to see that it is likely ever to promote social welfare, or that it is based upon sound finance, for I should have thought that if it were based upon sounder finance, if it would have obtained the support of any of those members of what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, somewhat impolitely described, as the "de
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0556"/>
<col>1099</col>
humanised monetary machine" which is his euphemism for the City&#x2014;I should feel there was some greater ground for the statement if this view were supported by any sound financial or commercial authority who is other than a political partizan. But although, as I have already said, I have been unable myself to detect the good qualities of this Budget, yet I confess that I hoped for a long time that a contest upon this question would be averted. For one thing I candidly confess that I always hoped, in common with other members of this House, that when it came to a struggle with another place that struggle would be fought upon what is called favourable ground. In this particular case I am afraid that we cannot flatter ourselves that we are going to embark upon the contest on favourable ground, and I find myself entirely in accord with a member of the present Administration who, when he was asked by an opponent with whom he was on friendly terms as to what he thought would be the best method of making the Budget unpopular, replied with, I think, profound political insight, "If you wish to make this Budget unpopular you ought to pass it."<lb/>
It appears to me that the temptation to pass the Budget is exceedingly strong. It would not have taken long to have shown the futility of the proposals, and the result to the Government would have been to have forced the Government into a more desperate course. On that ground it certainly does not strike me as either a very straightforward or a very courageous course of action to adopt. For that reason I regret more than I can say the speech which was made yesterday from the Cross Benches by my noble friend, Earl Rosebery, whose absence I regret at the present moment. But the sentiments of the noble Earl appear to me to be so admirably expressed in a British classic, which I hold in my hand, that I am unable to resist the temptation of quoting it in full, because it appears to me so exactly to typify the position adopted by the noble Earl&#x2014;
<quote>"Ruin stared me in the face. I took a desperate resolution. I left my home early one morning, with one suit of clothes on my back and another tied up in a bundle under my arm. I arrived on the cliffs, opened my bundle, deposited the suit of clothes on the very verge of the precipice, took one long look down into the yawning gulf beneath me and walked off in the opposite direction."</quote>
That appears to me exactly to describe the conduct of the noble Earl upon the occasion
<col>1100</col>
in question. He did not lead; he invited the Opposition to advance towards the edge of the precipice and when the edge of the precipice was attained he himself executed a right-about-face.<lb/>
There is another ground upon which I, at all events, should not have felt myself bound to oppose this Budget, and that is on the stereotyped ground that I, like, I presume, nearly everybody in this House, have long ago come to the conclusion that whatever Government is destined to rule us in the future rich people will, undoubtedly, have to pay more in the future than they have had to pay in the past. That is precisely, as everybody knows, what this Budget does not do, and as long as it specially and vindictively singles out two forms of wealth only for the purposes of taxation I, naturally, was disappointed in this expectation. There is a third reason why I desired, if possible, to see a compromise effected on the question of the Budget. That is, frankly, because it was perfectly apparent to me that the more aggressive and pugnacious members of the Government are only too anxious to have a fight upon this particular point.<lb/>
No great intelligence is required in order to realise what has led to the present situation. This Government, like all other Governments, has been steadily losing ground. It has seen its measures rejected and so far from that indignation being manifested which the noble Marquess appears to think rankles in the breast of every voter in the country the country notes the rejection of those measures with absolute indifference. In the endeavour to regain popularity, the leadership of the Liberal Party has fallen into the hands of the extreme men and those extreme men see an opportunity, not only of regaining popularity, but of destroying&#x2014;a thing which they value much more&#x2014;for effective purposes this House. Now, to do the Government justice I honestly believe that if any member of the Government, whom I see opposite now had been in charge of this measure, it would have been perfectly possible to have arrived at a compromise and there would have been no crisis, such as there is at the present moment. But whatever the feelings may be which actuate peaceable people like myself, what vestige of evidence has there been all through that any compromise of principle would be entertained by the persons who
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0557"/>
<col>1101</col>
are really, and not nominally, responsible for the policy of the Government? Owing to the attitude of those Ministers and owing it must be admitted, partly to the attitude adopted by some of ourselves at the earlier portion of the controversy we have, for some time since, arrived at the stage when, as the French say, "the guns go off of themselves."<lb/>
It is perfectly true, as has been pointed out over and over again in this debate, that this Budget has been so altered as to be almost unrecognisable. It contained so many absurdities and so many crudities that even with the gigantic mechanical majority which the Government command in another place they were fairly and honestly argued out of those absurdities by the small Unionist minority which exists in the House of Commons. But, on the other hand, in spite of those concessions, every speech delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made it perfectly plain that he never meant to yield, that he saw there was a good chance of a fight and that he was determined to make us fight upon it. Well, it is only fair to say that this line was not adopted by all Liberals. As long as there appeared to be a reasonable chance of carrying the Budget, the time-honoured Parliamentary dodge was tried on of producing bonnets to assure the world and to assure old-fashioned Liberals that this Budget really meant nothing in particular, and that it was only a very moderate scheme of Liberal finance which Mr. Gladstone himself would have been glad to give his benediction to, and all the "heavy fathers," official and non-official, of the Party, who belong to the Parliamentary cast, were introduced so that they might be brought forward and give their benedictions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the classical <i>macte nov&#x00E2; virtute, puer: sic itur ad astra</i> being rendered somewhat in these words, "Go on, my boy, put the burden on the widest shoulders; I am with you heart and soul, so long as my shoulders are not affected by the burden." It is wonderful the enthusiasm which can be created in the hearts of these noble-hearted patriots when they see that the burdens have to be borne by other people. But now that the Budget&#x2014;to put it mildly&#x2014;is <i>in extremis</i> there is no further occasion for these histrionics and everybody in the Party has now got to join in the shouting&#x2014;I might almost say the bellowing&#x2014;against this
<col>1102</col>
House, or else it is clearly intimated to them there will be no longer room for them in the Party. The long and short of that is that there is no longer room for any moderate men in the Liberal Party. Noble Lords know that as well as I do, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade have got their own way and a general election and a possible war of classes and the destruction of the old Liberal Party, and the elimination of the moderate men from that Party, is the price which you pay for being led by those adventurous spirits.<lb/>
Speaking for myself, I do not hesitate to say that I would sooner be the most insignificant Under-Secretary that ever crouched upon a Front Bench, the humblest private Member that ever tramped through the division Lobby at the bidding of an imperious Whip, rather than be known as the man who has utilised high office, and such gifts as nature has given me for the purpose of setting class against class and of hounding on one set of men against another. And when I study, which I do occasionally, the utterances of those twin protagonists of the Liberal Party, who like
<quote>&#x2026; "two coursers of ethereal race With necks in thunder cloth'd and long resounding pace"</quote>
are whirling along the Liberal chariot at the present moment, completely free of any control from those who are supposed to guide the Party, I confess I do not know whether I am most repelled by the nauseous cant in which they occasionally indulge, or by their almost blatant appeals to the predatory instincts of their fellow creatures. Take the case of that austere moralist, the President of the Board of Trade, who has invented a new political theory with regard to the attitude of the State towards wealth. In future the new Liberal Government is going to the taxpayer, saying in a homely sort of way,
<quote>"It is not your money we want; we are not actuated by any sordid feelings of that kind; we want to know how you made it. If you made your money in land, or if you have anything to do with what is called 'the Trade,' your wealth is obtained in an unsatisfactory manner, and you will be heavily fined; but if, on the contrary, your money has been made by manufacturing, shall I say, cocoa, chemicals, or a&#x00EB;raled waters, or soap, there is nothing criminal in that, and we think it only fair to spare you as much taxation as we consistently can."</quote>
What a vista this opens up for the really imaginative Liberal Chancellor of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0558"/>
<col>1103</col>
Exchequer of the future&#x0021; Why, in pursuance of this doctrine, he may say to himself&#x2014;
<quote>"There can be no more pernicious occupation in the world than to purvey Conservative political opinions. You are the owner of one of those pernicious newspapers, let us say <i>The Times</i>, or the <i>Winning Post</i>, or the <i>Spectator</i>. It is you who provide this unclean, deleterious stuff. You shall pay through the nose. Whereas as there can be clearly nothing more meritorious than to advocate Liberal opinions, it can only be fair that the <i>Daily News</i> and the <i>New Age</i> should escape from taxation altogether."</quote>
I pass from one moralist to another: to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is not likely to be left behind in the race. If there is one thing which nobody claims for this Budget at all, it is that it is going to do anything for unemployment. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer has the audacity to announce that he is about to wage what he calls "an implacable war against poverty;" that "no cupboard is to be left bare," and that he is "going to bring rare and refreshing fruit to the parched lips of the multitude." Yes, rare and refreshing fruit were brought to the parched lips of our old acquaintance Tantalus, but they never attained as far as his lips. He was never allowed to taste them or, so to speak, "get his teeth into them." And on the top of this we have the amazing statement. "To deceive the poor is the meanest of all crimes." These Pecksniffian sentiments may excite derision, but the shameless appeals to what I can only term the predatory instincts of the people are naturally of a more serious character. Nothing annoys the Government more&#x2014;and it is not difficult to annoy the Government&#x2014;than to be accused of Socialism.<lb/>
For my part I willingly acquit all noble Lords upon the Front Bench of any sympathy with Socialism, just as I acquit them of being responsible in any way for the provisions in this Budget. But if they decline the imputation; if, like my noble friend, Lord Ribblesdale, they are unable to detect any Socialism in the Budget, how do they account for the fact that Socialists, not only in this country but all over Europe, have risen as one man, or as one woman, and called this Budget blessed&#x2014;not the Government but the Budget; in fact it would be hardly correct to say the Budget, but a portion of the Budget! If the Government cannot quote one single, solitary, impartial financier or commercial
<col>1104</col>
authority in favour of their Budget, can they quote one single Socialist who is not in favour of it? I am afraid they cannot quote a banker or an agent, or a manager, or a builder, or even an auctioneer in favour of the Budget; but I repeat, that it would be impossible for them to name one single Socialist in this or any other country, who is not in favour of, at all events, some portions of it. As a matter of fact it has been received by Socialists all over the world as "glad tidings of great joy," and the new principles which have been introduced are considered, and probably rightly considered, to be the greatest advance which Socialism has made since it originally started. And the only real difference between the <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> Socialist and the present Government is this&#x2014;and I am afraid it is not a very complimentary difference&#x2014;the difference is that the pure Socialist is logical, and, according to his lights, a perfectly honest person, who proposes to appropriate the whole of private property for public benefit. The Government, on the other hand, only propose to appropriate a certain portion of a particular form of property, which, unhappily, happens to be identified with their political opponents.<lb/>
Nobody is really in the least taken in by the elaborate and ingenious arguments which are being constantly used in order to differentiate the case of land from anything else. The explanation is perfectly simple, the Lord Advocate, lapsing for a moment into accuracy, said, with extreme felicity, "Land cannot run away." Of course that is so. It stares you in the face, and nothing is easier than to create prejudice against people because they are the owners of land and their wealth is evident and it is stationary. They cannot get rid of it, whereas other people may be infinitely richer in every sense and yet, because their wealth is not apparent and is not fixed and stationary, they escape altogether.<lb/>
This very simple plan of helping out the Socialist case was pointed out by Karl Marx many years ago when he said that really England was the most favourable soil upon which to plant the Socialistic seed. It is almost pathetic, considering the efforts which have been made by the Government to placate the Socialists, to see the extreme ingratitude which they receive in return. The Socialists and the Labour people&#x2014;and personally I never can see any more difference
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0559"/>
<col>1105</col>
between the Socialist and a Labour leader than I can between, say, a coloured gentleman and a full-blooded negro&#x2014;the Socialists and the Labour people won't even give the Government credit for originality. They won't even give the Chancellor of the Exchequer credit for originality. They say that the Limehouse speech was only famous because all its economic and social items were copied substantially from the speeches of obscure street-corner talkers who had been spreading the views of the Labour party for years. That seems to me a perfectly true assertion, more especially that part which refers to street corners. It is in vain that the Chancellor of the Exchequer humbly follows in the train of Labour-cum-Socialist processions. The only return that he gets for the subservience is that whenever the Socialists or the Labour Party can manage to do so they run a candidate against a Government candidate. The attitude of the Labour-cum-Socialist coalition towards the Liberal Government suggests to me the attitude of the boa-constrictor towards its attendant. That somewhat unsympathetic animal receives all that is given it without evidencing any gratitude or any emotion. It takes all that it can get, and it will be quite ready to take the attendant himself and appropriate him should an opportunity arise.<lb/>
If the Socialists and Labour Party show less gratitude than might be expected for this heaven-sent gift in the shape of the Budget, it actually seems doubtful whether the ordinary voter appreciates it at its true value. This Budget is loudly described as the "People's Budget," the "Poor Man's Budget," and, above all, the "Popular Budget." Yet it is a most remarkable thing to me that the most enormous pains are taken to emphasise the fact that the Budget really is popular&#x2014;efforts before which even the exertions of Mr. Haldane and Lord Esher on behalf of the Territorial Army, pale. In order to emphasise the fact that the Budget is really popular a gigantic League has been started to proclaim the fact. A distinguished law officer of the Crown has been liberated from his duties in older to perambulate the country and to present the Budget in its most attractive, or perhaps it would be more correct to say, its most alluring, lights. Even such things as gramophones and other mechanical appliances have been introduced; and finally even the spirits of the illustrious have been invoked to bestow blessings, couched
<col>1106</col>
in such vile grammar, that the language certainly would have been disowned during life.<lb/>
Then, too, I do not infer for myself that the by-elections which have taken place since the Budget was introduced, convey any idea of excessive popularity. There have, I think, been four. One of those elections was lost. In the other seats&#x2014;they were all carefully selected&#x2014;the Government candidate was returned in each case with a largely reduced majority. Upon the whole it is not so very surprising that the Budget may turn out to be less popular than was abundantly supposed, because although it sounds very well at first if you tell A that B is going to be heavily taxed, yet if A finds he does not benefit by it, and that C, for instance, is gravely inconvenienced by it his enthusiasm for the proposal is likely to evaporate to a very considerable extent. Upon the whole I am personally inclined to hope that the reputed popularity of the Budget must rest largely upon the speeches which have been made against it in the country by members of this House; speeches which, unfortunately have been interpreted in a somewhat different sense from that in which they were delivered. Then it is assumed that even supposing the proposals are less popular than is commonly supposed, nevertheless thousands, and, indeed, possibly millions, of voters, will be so goaded to frenzy at the idea of any infraction of the privileges of the Commons that there can be no possible doubt as to the result. Now I desire to speak with all respect of the House of Commons, for one reason because I was for some years a member of that Assembly myself; but I cannot resist the feeling that at the present time a great many people have what I venture to call privilege on the brain. There are many estimable persons who enter Parliament firmly convinced that they are the only people in the country in whom any real interest is taken, and that what seems to them matters of supreme importance, such as the forms of the House, the procedure, resolutions, and privileges are matters of equally absorbing interest to the outside world. Not even a perusal of the halfpenny papers, which never report anything at all of what happens in the other place unless it be in the nature of an incident, seems to convince them to the contrary. I myself believe this view to be an absolute delusion.<lb/>
My firm belief is that the ordinary voter in this country does not concern himself in the very least with questions of this
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0560"/>
<col>1107</col>
kind. He sends people to represent his opinion and to get certain work done. And if that work is not done, or if it is done in a way he disapppoves, he replaces them with somebody else. But to suggest that the ordinary voter is violently agitated over, for instance, the exact meaning of a resolution passed more than two hundred years ago is too heavy a draft upon my credulity at all events. This is the kind of question which enormously excites professors and dons and people who write long letters to the <i>Spectator</i> and to papers of that kind. But does anybody seriously suppose that the voters are going to work themselves into an uncontrolled fury because we say that they ought to be consulted upon what is admitted by the Government itself to be nothing but a revolution. Does any voter draw elaborate distinctions between Bill or Budget? Does he care whether a Bill, if it is a good one, is introduced in this House or the other House, and does anybody believe, for one single moment, that because an abnormal step is to be taken by this House that this House is going continually to interfere in such matters to the end of time? I do not believe there is any person possessed of the smallest amount of common sense who entertains those views for an instant; and my firm belief is that when the contest takes place the purely constitutional question will play a very little part. With regard to this contest I myself embark upon it, I freely admit, like everybody else, with the greatest reluctance. I said at the beginning of my remarks that I had hoped for a long time that there would be no contest at all. I cannot help realising the extreme disadvantages under which we fight. As a matter of fact we have been driven, or jockeyed into a fight. It is not one of our seeking. My hope is that the commonsense of this country will once again come to our assistance and that people will realise that the mere collection of money is not the end in view; that they will realise at the same time that the Licensing Clauses embody a principle already rejected and that the Land Clauses are not remunerative but vindictive, and that if these proposals are allowed to take effect they will injure, and probably finally destroy, that credit and confidence upon which the prosperity of the country depends.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03503"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think there should be some division of labour
<col>1108</col>
in a debate of this kind, and that each member of the House should endeavour to deal with two or three points. For this reason I shall not attempt to deal at length with the constitutional question. I am quite satisfied with the manner in which that has been treated by the Lord Chancellor in his most able speech, and also by the noble Lord, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in a speech extremely able, lucid, and courageous. We all feel, on this side, that in abstract law there is a right on the part of this House to reject the Finance Bill, but what we say is that, by the usages of Parliament for many centuries that right has practically been abrogated, and that the House of Commons has acquired supremacy in the finance of this country. For my part I cannot believe that that supremacy can be set aside without considerable danger to the State. If this Amendment is carried it will form a precedent for the future of a most dangerous character, and I do not believe for a moment that any Liberal Government can take office after the General Election, if the election should prove favourable to them, or could resume office at any future time if this election should be unfavourable to them, without obtaining powers for the purpose of upsetting the decision at which your Lordships will probably arrive on this Amendment, and for resuming, on the part of the House of Commons, full control over the finance of the country. Whenever that comes about other questions undoubtedly will have to be dealt with affecting the relations of the two Houses.<lb/>
I think no one can have sat through the debates on the many measures which have come up from the House of Commons during the last four years and seen the manner in which those measures have been treated by your Lordships without having felt that the position of the Government in this House is a somewhat humiliating and impotent one. They are completely at the mercy every night of the Opposition. They cannot practically carry any measures without the consent of the Opposition. Perhaps the most conspicuous instance of this position is the case of Bills affecting Ireland. Bills affecting Ireland come up from the other House, where they have been supported by enormous majorities of the representatives of the Irish people; they come here and are dealt with by a House in which there is
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0561"/>
<col>1109</col>
not a single representative of the Irish Nationalist Party and where the overwhelming number of Peers representing Ireland represent one interest only. They are dealt with by this House in a fashion which was exhibited in the Land Bill only a few days ago, and they are sent back to the other House and eventually some kind of compromise is arrived at. Legislation dealt with in this way cannot possibly, I think, give satisfaction to Ireland. It appears to me, therefore, that some change is absolutely necessary in the relations of the two Houses. What that change will be I cannot at the present moment enter upon; but my own impression is that it is more likely to take the line of the recommendations of the late Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, than any great change in the construction and constitution of the House.<lb/>
Turning to the Budget before the House, I should like to say one or two words upon the land clauses, and especially upon the clause dealing with increment value. It has been said by many speakers in the course of the debate that this clause amounts to confiscation, and is Socialistic. I cannot myself take that view of the case. The first, I believe, who advised the principle of the taxation of unearned increment was the late Mr. Mill, and he was very far removed indeed from Socialism. I think I was present at the birth of the idea, because something like forty-five years ago I was a member of the Political Economy Club, of which Mr. Mill was a leading member, and it was there that he first broached his idea of unearned increment. That club consisted of members of the most orthodox economic type, but it was never suggested by any one of them that the proposal of Mr. Mill was Socialistic. The only difficulty that was ever raised by the club was that it would be extremely difficult to work out in practice, and that was my view of the case until quite lately. But it seems to me that the Government have very cleverly devised a scheme under which it can be practically worked.<lb/>
I should like to give the House an illustration of the possible working of the increment clause of this Bill. A good many years ago I was concerned with a number of others in the purchase of a very large property adjoining Hampstead Heath with a view of adding it to that open space. We arranged for the purchase
<col>1110</col>
of 240 acres there, from two large owners, and with the assistance of the London County Council and other local authorities we were able to raise the money for the purpose. The price was something over &#x00A3;1,000 an acre. It transpired from the title deeds which were examined on the purchase of this property that a considerable part of it had been bought some thirty or forty years earlier for &#x00A3;50 an acre. Therefore this land bad increased in value during thirty or forty years from &#x00A3;50 an acre to &#x00A3;1,000 an acre, and during the whole of that time it had paid nothing in the shape of rates to the local authority except as agricultural land. Now it does seem to me that land under that condition may fairly be called upon to contribute something to the State and equally to the local authority. I am told that quite recently some more land adjoining that of which I speak, some four or five acres, has been sold to one of the local authorities at the price of &#x00A3;5,000 an acre. Therefore there has been yet a further increase from &#x00A3;1,000 to &#x00A3;5,000 an acre. It seems to me that that, again, is an illustration of a case where it is not unreasonable that a considerable contribution should be made to the State.<lb/>
Turning to another point, I observed that the noble Marquess who opened this debate said in the course of his able speech that in his view the Budget exhausted all the possibilities of raising revenue on Free Trade principles, and apparently it was on that ground, to some extent, that he gave his adherence to the scheme of the Tariff Reformers. For my part I cannot think that the revenue to be derived on Free Trade principles is exhausted by the Budget. It would be easy enough for Parliament to revert to the taxes which were put on in 1900&#x2013;1901 by the late Government under the auspices of their then Free Trade Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord St. Aldwyn. We might put on another penny to the Income Tax. We might raise again the Sugar Duties and the Tea Duties to the level at which he put them, and we might also again reimpose the import duty on coal, which, although in my opinion a bad tax, is not half so bad as a duty upon the import of foods. If we imposed those duties we should raise a revenue of &#x00A3;11,000,000&#x2014;a very considerable amount&#x2014;all within the purview of Free Trade doctrines. Although I consider that there is this
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0562"/>
<col>1111</col>
alternative to the Budget I do not propose it as an alternative. On the contrary, I think that the Government have done exceedingly well in not imposing extra duties on tea and sugar. At the present moment, when the prices have been rising of almost every kind of food, it would be a very great burden to the labouring people if the prices of tea and sugar were increased. Although I hold that there is another alternative to the present Budget compatible with Free Trade doctrines, and which is an important reserve in the event of war, yet I also think that such an alternative is not likely to come from the Opposition in the event of their succeeding at the General Election. From all appearances, if a Unionist Government should be returned after the General Election it is more likely to adopt the scheme of the Tariff Reformers.<lb/>
I should like the House to consider what would be the incidence of the two schemes&#x2014;the Budget scheme and the Tariff Reform scheme&#x2014;upon the two classes of the community, namely, the agricultural labourers and the agricultural landowners. These classes occupy two extremes of our social system. The effect of the Budget upon the labourers will be an extremely small one. Lord Pentland, with great justice, said the burden of the Budget on the working classes would be equivalent to two pence in the pound on their wages. He referred, I think, to an artisan earning 30<i>s</i>. a week, and if we take the case of the agricultural labourer, who does not earn more than half of this. I do not think the burden would be more than 1&#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the pound at the outside. What will be the burden under a Tariff Reform scheme? I must make this assumption, which I am told the Tariff Reformers will not admit, that an import duty will raise the price of the article upon which the duty is imposed by at least the same amount as the duty and probably by something more. I believe that the assumption that the foreign importer will pay any part of the duty is a wrong one, and that there is no warrant for it in political economy. In fact, it is a fable worthy only to be told to the marines. All economists of any repute have always recognised that an import duty raises the price of the imported article. This is the experience of all protected countries. There is a warrant for that in the case of drawbacks allowed on exports of articles which have paid duty and in various other ways. I must assume that an import duty
<col>1112</col>
will raise the prices of imported articles. Upon that assumption it is not difficult to work out the effect of the Tariff Reform scheme. It would be to raise the prices of the articles consumed by the labourer by at least the average amount of duties which it is proposed to raise&#x2014;namely, seven and a half per cent., if you take into account not merely food, but other necessaries of life. The burden on the agricultural labourer would be something like 16<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;1, compared with 1&#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;1 under the Budget. The difference is enormous.<lb/>
Then how do the two schemes bear upon the landowner? I do not mean the fortunate man who owns land in a suburban district, but the owner of agricultural land. I will take the case of an agricultural landowner, and I think the Budget, when carefully examined, will be shown to bear very lightly upon him. Take the case of a landowner with gross income of &#x00A3;10,000 a year, and a net income of &#x00A3;5,000, the difference being accounted for in part by the burden of repairs and maintenance of the property, and in part by family charges and interest on mortgages. Under the Budget the landowner with a net income of &#x00A3;5,000 a year will not have to pay the Super Tax; he will only have to pay the extra twopence on the Income Tax, and he will have the great boon under the Budget of the relief of further abatements as regards the Income Tax in respect of one-eighth of the gross rental expended upon repairs and maintenance. Under the present law he is only allowed one-eighth, but under the Budget he will be allowed another one-eighth abatement, and he will save the Income Tax of 1<i>s</i>. in respect of that additional abatement. That will amount to a considerable sum of money in excess of that payable under the twopence extra Income Tax. The abatement in such a case would be &#x00A3;62 per year, whereas the twopenny Income Tax would be only &#x00A3;40. On the other hand it may be reasonable to take into account that the landowner may be a provident man and may desire to insure himself against the increased Settlement Duty. Under the Budget the increased Settlement Duty is one per cent., and to insure that for an average age of fifty years he would require an outlay of &#x00A3;50. Taking all these into account, the landowner with a net income of &#x00A3;5,000 would only have to pay under the Budget &#x00A3;28 in the shape of increased burdens, and that seems to me a very small amount&#x2014;it is not so much as the wages of a single gardener.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0563"/>
<col>1113</col>
Under a Tariff Reform scheme the landowner with a net income of &#x00A3;5,000 would have to meet some increased cost on food and other necessaries of life for himself and his family. That would not be a very considerable sum, and, on the other side, he would very greatly benefit; he would gain an increase of rent in consequence of the increased prices of agricultural produce. If I am right in my statement that the price of agricultural produce would be increased exactly in the proportion of the import duty, so the rent will increase in the same proportion. We have statutory authority for this. In the case of a Tithe Act it is provided that the tithe, which is in fact a part of the rent of land, rises and falls exactly in proportion to the rise or fall in the price of corn from year to year. This is a statutory recognition of the fact that rent will rise in proportion to the prices of food. If the average import duty under the scheme is to be seven and a-half per cent. upon imported food of all kinds, we may be perfectly certain that, sooner or later, rent will increase in the same proportion; moreover, a landowner with a net income of &#x00A3;5,000 a year will get an increase of this rent, not upon the net, but upon the gross income of &#x00A3;10,000 a year. Calculating that at seven and a-half per cent. there will be an increase of &#x00A3;750 a year to his income. Therefore the landowner in this case would gain &#x00A3;750 and would lose only the increase in the price of food for himself and his family. I think I have shown, therefore, that under the two schemes the agricultural labourer would, in the case of the Budget, have a very small burden put upon him, and a very heavy one by the Tariff Reform scheme, where as in the case of a landowner the present Budget would impose only a very small burden and the alternative scheme would also impose only a very small burden, whilst on the other hand it would increase his rents very largely.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, in alluding to the landowners, referred to the fact that no less than one-fifth of the land in this country is owned by members of your Lordships' House. That was the calculation, I believe, arrived at by the "Domesday Book" of twenty-five or thirty years ago, and I do not think there has been much change since that time, except that a certain number of Irish landlords have sold their property to their tenants and some territorial magnates have been added to the members of the House. On the other hand,
<col>1114</col>
there has been a considerable reduction of rent, to the extent of at least thirty per cent. But taking this into account, it would appear that the average rental of members of this House is at the present time&#x2014;and there are over 600 members in the House&#x2014;&#x00A3;16,000 a year. Lord Rosebery seemed to think that the House of Lords, which is so deeply interested in land, ought to have some voice in the finances of the country. If by voice he merely meant the opportunity of discussing the Budget in this House, they have that already. But if it is intended that they shall have some share in the responsibility of passing a Finance Bill and some power of controlling the finances of the country, I venture to differ from him <i>in toto</i>. I think it would be dangerous for the House of Lords, being so deeply interested in the land of the country, to have a voice in the finances of the country. Looking at the Budget as a whole, I believe it to be a just and fair one. It imposes charges on all classes of the community&#x2014;very light charges upon the labouring people and those of small means, rising by gradations to a higher charge in proportion to their superfluities, but not in a manner to cause them any embarrassment. It seeks out new sources of revenue in the increment of land and the monopoly of the license holders. I think, therefore, it is a fair and reasonable Budget. On the other hand, the alternative proposal which has been suggested tends in the opposite direction. It relieves property of all kinds from any charge, and throws immense burdens on the labouring classes. In short, it can only be described as a scheme for robbing the poor for the benefit of the rich.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03504"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to touch upon the grave constitutional issues which have been raised, further than to say that I fully concur in the view expressed by the noble. Marquess in his Amendment. I cannot think that the course which has been recommended, that this House should pass this Bill for the present and trust to a rebound taking place in the opinion of the public when the nature of its provisions come to be known by experience, would be either right or straightforward, But apart from that higher view on which I confess that I feel most deeply, and taking the much lower view of policy and expediency, I do not think it is a course that it would be judicious to adopt. Should that rebound take place, the odium attaching to the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0564"/>
<col>1115</col>
framers of the Bill would be shared in by this House, and would fall even more severely upon it, because it would be said the promoters of the Bill believed, however erroneously, in the excellence of its provisions, while the House of Lords adopted it knowing it to be bad, and the public would say that the House of Lords was far the worse of the two. Among the large section of our countrymen opposed to the Bill there would be those who would say "the House of Lords shared our convictions that the Bill was a bad one, and still they passed it and deserted us in our hour of need." Therefore, from both quarters we should lose what respect attaches to the decision of this House.<lb/>
I should like to say a word upon the effect this Bill will have on Ireland and the impression it has created. Lord Mayo has said that it has been received in Ireland with marked hostility and even with a feeling approaching to dismay. He told the House that a great many local bodies had protested against it, and that some had even taken the extreme and unusual course of appealing to the members of this House to vote against it. Ireland has been favoured in the case of the licence duties, but, on the other hand, all the objections raised to the Bill in this country apply with more force to Ireland, because increased taxation presses harder upon a poor country than the rich one. Talking about rich men in Ireland reminds one of the old story of the man who began a scientific dissertation on snakes in Iceland by saying "There are no snakes in Iceland." In Ireland there are no rich men, or so few that they don't count. People there lead somewhat hard and struggling lives, and find it extremely difficult to make both ends meet. The acceptance of this Budget means retrenchment in consequence of the increased taxation, and retrenchment
<col>1116</col>
means reduction of the labour bill. In this way labourers will suffer acutely when the enhanced taxation comes into force on the more well-to-do people. Another class that would suffer severely is the new race of peasant proprietors&#x2014;those who have purchased their farms under the recent Land Purchase Acts. These men, the great majority of whom are small farmers, will suffer both by the Death Duties and by the increased duties on transfers or dealings in land. It may appear to be a small matter, but it would be a big thing to them. Some may say that no facilities ought to be given to such transfers. A certain class of politicians hold that the panacea for the woes of Ireland is the subdivision of the land into small farms, the boundaries of which are to be stereotyped for all time, tilled by the present occupants and their descendants, without change, for ever. This is manifestly impossible, and it is not at all desirable that if a man has good reason to part with his farm he should be precluded from doing so. In my opinion it is better that he should do so, and that another man better qualified should succeed him. Transfers of land will take place, and that there should be any impediment to legitimate transfers is, in my opinion, extremely undesirable. In conclusion, I do urge that the new duties on excisable commodities press very hardly upon the poorer sections of the community. It is their position that I submit to the House, and I appeal to your Lordships to take that into consideration and to express your objection to this Bill by supporting the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition.<lb/>

<title>IRISH LAND BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03506">Order of the Day read for the consideration of Commons Amendments to Lords further Amendments and Commons consequential Amendments and Commons Reasons for disagreeing to several of the Lords Amendments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03507"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving that these Amendments be now considered, I have really but little to say beyond expressing a hope that the action taken in another place may, on the whole, commend itself to your Lordships' House. I am quite aware that there are various points on which your Lordships, particularly those who have personal interests in Ireland, would have desired to see this measure become law in a different form; but at the same time I am confident that even those noble Lords who feel most strongly on the subject will admit that His Majesty's Government have met their views in several most important particulars. I will not waste the time of your Lordships' House by any general description of how that has been done, because it will be evident when we proceed to consider these few Amendments, quite apart from other Amendments which were made and agreed to in the course of the debates here. But I would remind the House that in another place the Chief Secretary agreed to several Amendments made by your Lordships, although in doing so he received the opposition of a number of Irish members. I think that is all I have to say, and I will make the Motion that stands in my name, that these Amendments be considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03508">Moved, That the Commons Amendments and Reasons be considered.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Crewe.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03509"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know that it is necessary for me to comment at any length on the statement made by the noble Earl. He has expressed a hope that the action taken in another place upon our Amendments will commend itself to this House. I should certainly be wanting in frankness if I made
<col>1118</col>
believe that the action taken by the members of the Government who are responsible for Irish administration in the House of Commons does commend itself to us generally or to noble Lords from Ireland in particular. The noble Earl calls attention to the fact that on several points the wishes of this House have been met and their Amendments accepted. That is quite true. If you count the Amendments, I quite admit that there are a very considerable number of them with regard to which we have been met in a reasonable spirit; but we have made it clear throughout these discussions that what we cared most for was not what I may call the general mass of the Amendments so much as two or three particular Amendments upon which we concentrated our attention. One in particular we have from the first put in the forefront of our arguments&#x2014;that is the Amendment relating to the tribunal which was to deal with appeals in regard to the necessity of compulsion and in regard to the compensation to be paid to those owners who were required compulsorily to give up their land. Now, my Lords, on that point, which we shall no doubt come to presently, I certainly do not think that we have been fully met, and I feel quite sure, whatever decision we may come to, that we shall have to put on record that we are by no means satisfied with the fairness of the proposals of His Majesty's Government so far as the appeal on price is concerned.<lb/>
On another point we have also, I think, some reason to complain of the manner in which our proposals have been met. Those proposals, the noble Earl will remember, were the result of an attempt to arrive, outside these walls, at what I should describe as a reasonable give-and-take arrangement, and one of the points on which we thought we were going to be met was the point where it was proposed by us that what is usually referred to as the standard of congestion should be fixed at &#x00A3;5 instead of &#x00A3;10. We certainly were under the impression that on that point we had a fair prospect of being met by the noble Earl and his friends. We find a compromise, for which, like all compromises, something can be said, but which certainly stops very far short of meeting our requirements. I will only say that my view of the position at which we have arrived is this, that considering the political conditions of the moment there is not much
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0566"/>
<col>1119</col>
to be gained by a prolongation of these controversies. I am quite ready to admit that on some points a desire has been shown by the Chief Secretary to consider our suggestions, and I am certainly ready to say that the Bill as we now see it, in what I presume will be its final form, is a very much less objectionable Bill than the Bill as it first came to this House. In particular, I make that observation with regard to the retention of the zones, which we now rejoice to see are not to be called in question at all. My Lords, I thought it necessary, as the noble Earl prefaced our proceedings with a few general observations, to make these remarks, and I suppose he will now proceed to put the Amendments <i>seriatim</i> to the House.</membercontribution></p>

There are a great many people in Ireland who do not like the zones, as is evident from what was said in another place by those entitled to speak for them. But his Majesty's Government have never adopted that attitude, and I think your Lordships will agree that in reverting to the <i>status quo</i> and leaving out Clause 14 we show that this is certainly the case. As the House will remember, certain Amendments were made by way of creating precautions in particular cases,

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03543"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: With regard to this Amendment, I frankly admit that there is something to be said on both sides. Neither definition, I think, can be taken as an entirely satisfactory one&#x2014;that is to say, the definition by number or the definition by area in a particular estate for the purpose of defining it as being congested. It is no doubt true that you could name instances in which the numerical calculation which the House of Commons propose to restore might turn out to work unfairly. But, on the other hand, there are, as I am informed, in actual fact a number of cases in which the area definition, as proposed, I chink, by my noble friend behind me, Lord MacDonnell, might also work very unfairly. There are cases where there are a considerable number of holdings on a particular estate just of the kind which it is most necessary to deal with, and perhaps the whole of the rest of the property is held in either one or two hands. In that case the congested holdings are barred from coming under the clause. That, I am sure, is not what you would desire, and although, as I say, I do not think it is possible to arrive at a completely fair definition on either one line or the other, I am convinced, since I have inquired about the matter, that this definition by number is in fact a fairer definition than the definition by area, and I hope your Lordships, therefore, will agree to accept the decision of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

My object in all this business was to concentrate attention on congestion in the West of Ireland in the scheduled area as it now exists, that is the throe millions of acres, and to obtain for that area the &#x00A3;1,000,000 which it is proposed to ear-mark for the purchase of land and the other sums proposed to be given by the Bill in cash for the purposes of dealing with congestion in that area. My whole object and aim was to keep these large sums of money for the districts now scheduled as congested in the West of Ireland and to leave congestion outside the existing scheduled area to the Estates Commissioners to deal with by means of the additional sum which the State will be bound to provide for the operations of the Estates Commissioners. I have been defeated in that policy by the extension of the jurisdiction of the Congested Districts Board, and all I have now to say is that if your Lordships desire to relieve congestion in Ireland wherever you find it, and if the Treasury is prepared to provide money for that purpose, I should be the last person to say you no.</membercontribution></p>

The Amendment in line 9 was an Amendment to subsection (2) of Clause 41, which clause empowered the Land Commission to enter upon estates and untenanted land which they proposed to purchase with the object of ascertaining the boundaries of the estate and of estimating its value. I endeavoured to point out at the former stage that such power was necessary, because, without it, if there was to be any question later on of compulsory purchase, the Estates Commissioners would obviously be in no position to make an offer. My plea was not accepted by your Lordships. What I ventured to point out did not appear to appeal to your Lordships' view; but, on the other hand, you pointed out that where there was no question of making a compulsory purchase it was unreasonable to give this power of general inspection to the Estates Commissioners. That is so, and the Amendment which we propose meets that point, because in another place it was agreed that after the word "any" in line 10, the word "congested" should be inserted. The effect, of course, of that is to limit this power to estates which in some circumstances might be compulsorily acquired.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03569"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Amendment has come about in a rather curious way. The figure which was originally proposed was the outcome of those informal communications between the two parties which, as your Lordships know, took place, but it has been pointed out that the effect of the numbers which we then arrived at was to cause the Board to consist of the fatal number of thirteen. I cannot profess to say whether it is desirable or otherwise that a Board should consist of thirteen persons. To be quite frank, I can see no earthly reason why it should not; but in Ireland a great many superstitious people hold a contrary opinion and consider that the Board should not consist of that unlucky number. It is for that reason that we have proposed to provide for the number of appointed members being nine instead of eight. Noble Lords might say, "Why not take one off instead of putting one on?" But I think anybody who has followed the course of the general discussion will see that to do that would cause some little difficulty in view of the present composition of the Board, and of the generally admitted, I will not say necessity, but desirability, of importing some new blood into the Board as it exists at present.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03585"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: This, of course, opens up the whole question which the noble Marquess very rightly pointed out as having been the principal cause of disagreement between the two sides of the House on the question of the tribunal. We have held all through that the Judicial Commissioner, either aided by some technical advisers or sitting alone, formed as good and as secure a tribunal in the interests of justice, which is, after all, what we all desire, as could be found, and we do not think that for the particular purpose of fixing the price, which is now the only question involved&#x2014;because noble Lords opposite will remember that so far as the question of the suitability of the particular piece of land and the possibility of finding land elsewhere is concerned an appeal is given&#x2014;a better tribunal could be devised. We have never believed that three Judges of the High Court formed a good tribunal to fix the price of anything. If one of your Lordships was going to buy a horse, he might take the opinion of my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale, or of either of the noble Marquesses who sit on the Front Bench opposite, but he would not in the least
<col>1126</col>
desire to take the opinion of the Court of Appeal who had never seen the horse, and who, if they did, probably would not be competent to form an opinion of its value, nor indeed would he take the opinion of any judicial body on such a matter. The Judicial Commissioner, on the other hand, is an expert; he is not only an expert but, what is very much better, he is by general consent admitted to possess and to exercise the highest judicial qualities, and I confess for myself that I, for one, would never have agreed to the creation of a tribunal of this kind if I did not believe, as my right hon. friend also believes, that the interests of those whose land is thus to be taken would be most entirely and completely safeguarded. My Lords, once more I would draw your attention to the fact that there is an appeal from the Judicial Commissioner to the Court of Appeal on any question under the clause which your Lordships inserted&#x2014;that is to say, on the necessity of purchase. That. I think, must constitute in your Lordships' minds a very important difference, because the fear has been, as I understand, that land will be taken not only compulsorily but also casually without due inquiry as to whether or not other suitable land can be found in the neighbourhood. So far as that fear is concerned, even although it may not have been an entirely reasonable one, it is completely removed by this provision. Therefore, it is simply on the question of price. Price is always necessarily a question of valuation, and I do not think that in any way you could obtain a better or a fairer system of valuation than that which we propose. I hope, therefore, that this I branch of the subject, which has given rise to so much discussion and about which strong feeling has been evidently raised, may be considered to be satisfactorily settled by the proposals in the Commons Amendments. I venture to think that the interests of all parties are sufficiently safeguarded, and yet the amount of trouble and expense which would, as we fear, have prevented the application of compulsory powers altogether if the Amendments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, had been accepted as he originally introduced them, may be avoided. I trust, therefore, that your Lordships will give your assent to the Amendments as made in another place.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1127</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03587"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say one word on this question. This Amendment, as the noble Earl has just said, is one that created the greatest, I will not say excitement, but the greatest possible interest among noble Lords from Ireland. I am only speaking for myself, and I have no authority from my noble friends to say anything on their behalf. But I am perfectly at liberty to say that a considerable number of noble Lords from Ireland, I for one among the number, felt so strongly on this matter that we have even thought and frequently said that we would prefer to see the Bill lost altogether rather than have a tribunal established for the purpose of fixing value in which we could not place implicit confidence. I must beg to assure the House that in saying this I am saying nothing against Mr. Justice Wylie; very much to the contrary; but Mr. Justice Wylie may vacate his office at any moment. We do not know who may be appointed in his place, and it is a most serious thing to think, considering the magnitude of the interests involved, that the value of a very large portion of Ireland might be left to be fixed by any one man&#x2014;I do not care who he is&#x2014;who may not happen to possess the qualifications of Mr. Justice Wylie. We still feel very strongly on this, but we now recognise that there has been an improvement in the original proposal by leaving the case of necessity and the suitability of land to the Court of Appeal, and we also feel that, owing to the peculiar political state of things at this moment and the advice that has been tendered to us from a quarter which we are bound to respect, we have reluctantly come to the decision not to oppose this proposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03588"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think the House must have listened with satisfaction to the statement just made by my noble friend Lord Clonbrock. He and I have throughout these discussions regarded this question from very much the same point of view. We have felt that a good appeal, an appeal commanding general confidence, was of absolute necessity. Now we have certainly got, upon all questions but those of price, what seems to me, as a layman, a very excellent appeal. We have a general appeal under the words to be found at the top of page 5 of the printed Amendments. We have an appeal to the Court of Appeal, not only upon questions of law, but really upon all questions except that of price. There remains,
<col>1128</col>
then, the one question of price. I think my noble friend Lord Clonbrock has expressed the view entertained by all who have considered this question, that in the hands of Mr. Justice Wylie the parties may consider themselves perfectly safe, but we have regarded this question not as a question to be discussed on personal grounds but on grounds of principle, and we remain of opinion that the last word upon the question of price ought not to be spoken by an official, however distinguished or however high a character he may hold, who is a member of the very Department which is concerned from the first in these proceedings for the compulsory acquisition of land. But I am bound to say I think there is some force in the noble Earl's contention that the Court of Appeal is not a very appropriate tribunal to dispose of mere questions of land value&#x2014;I mean where you have the question of whether a certain parcel of land is worth 15<i>s</i>. or &#x00A3;1 an acre. That is hardly the class of question which you would naturally expect to go to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal is, however, not the only arbitral tribunal which we can conceive, and we do hold very strongly that with a little more goodwill His Majesty's Government could have provided us with some arbitral tribunal with regard to the question of price entirely outside of, and unconnected with, the machinery of the Land Commission. To speak quite plainly, His Majesty's Government have put their foot down at this point, and we, as practical people, have to recognise that although our feelings remain perfectly unaltered on the subject there is no prospect of obtaining what we want and that if we press our views we are faced with the alternative of wrecking the Bill. That alternative we do not desire to face for reasons we have again and again explained, and therefore it seems to me there is nothing for it but to accept the proposal of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03610"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope it will not be out of place for me at this stage to draw attention to the real utility of your Lordships' House as a revising body and to the necessity of it as a Second Legislative Chamber. When this Irish Land Bill came up to this House from another place it was, in my humble opinion, and I believe in the opinion of many noble Lords on this side of the House, really an unworkable measure. We must remember that as far as compulsion was concerned it was applicable to the whole of Ireland, and we drew attention to the fact that if compulsion was to be applied to the whole of Ireland, and the owners of land were to be paid in cash, there would be great difficulty with regard to financing. Secondly, there was the question of the zones; if that system was to be removed from land purchase it would mean endless litigation and a great deal of time and trouble to all parties in Ireland. Thirdly, there was the question of the Judicial Commissioner. Conferences have taken place between the representatives of both Houses of Parliament and a working arrangement has been arrived at, and I believe that this Bill, as it will now become law, will be a real boon to Ireland, although I do not say that the landlords, or that we on this side of the House, have got all that we ought to have got.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1132</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03611"><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Earl who has just sat down that this measure will be a real boon to Ireland. The main principle now will be the relief of congestion, and I do hope that some of the members at any rate of the Board who will have charge of this matter will understand the different classes of land with which they will have to deal. That is, in my opinion, a very important point, because in the past the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners have made sad mistakes, simply because they had no personal knowledge of the different kinds of land with which they had to deal, and what each particular piece was suitable for. I warned your Lordships on the Second Reading of this Bill that owing to the conditions now prevailing in Ireland tenants would not be able to pay their annuity. That has come about, I am sorry to say, sooner even than I expected. At the last Quarter Sessions over 100 tenant farmers were freed from annuities because they could not sell their young stock. This has come about owing to mistakes made in the past by which the cattle trade has been upset, and I hope the Government will take care to place on the Board men who really understand the land in the different districts and what it is suitable for, so that such mistakes may not again occur.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03622"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of offering any opposition to the Second Reading of this Bill, but merely to call attention to two points with regard to which I should be grateful for an explanation from the noble and learned Lord when he has had time to consider the Bill. The first is with regard to Clause 1, which says that it shall be part of the duty of a trustee&#x2014;
<quote>"to keep clear and accurate accounts of the trust, and preserve for a reasonable time all vouchers relating thereto, so that the accounts and vouchers may he at all reasonable times ready for production."</quote>
We all know that, generally speaking, in the case of every trust there are several trustees, and that many of these trusts run on for a great number of years. I have no doubt many of your Lordships are trustees of trusts that have gone on for more than half a century. Of course they are covered by the provisions of this Bill, but new trustees would not be; and what I venture to suggest for the consideration of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack is whether it would not be better to say that the duty should be on the first trustee named, so as to make it the duty of one of the trustees only, because it is quite clear that they cannot all keep the accounts and that the vouchers must be in the custody of one person. Probably my noble and learned friend will be able to say, when the Bill conies up again, that the fears which some of us entertain on this point are groundless, and that it is covered by the law as it stands. One other point
<col>1134</col>
with regard to which I would like a word of explanation from the noble and learned Lord at the next stage of the Bill is why the Bill is not to apply to the Public Trustee. There, again, I have no doubt there is good reason for it, but it would, I think, be satisfactory to many of us to know what that reason is. I would, therefore, ask my noble and learned friend to kindly consider those two points before the Bill comes before us at the next stage. I have no doubt that the points have already been considered, and that the words as they appear to a layman do not really carry out the meaning they seem to do, but that they are guarded by the provisions of some other measure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03635"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the first time I have had the honour to address your Lordships' House on any but subjects connected with my own Indian Department, and I therefore feel that I need the same measure of indulgence that your Lordships were good enough to extend to me during the debates on the Indian Councils Bill. I count myself a very unfortunate politician, for during most of the twenty or twenty-five years I was in the House of Commons I was confronted by a Conservative majority. Here I find myself confronted by a Conservative opposition still more inexorable and relentless, I fear, than that which used to confront us in the House of Commons.<lb/>
What, after all, is the drift and significance
<col>1138</col>
of the Amendment which you are going to vote upon to-morrow night? I think the Amendment, though contained in a couple of lines, and though containing very few words, involves no fewer than five points, each of which I think to be more removed from precedent, departing further from constitutional usage and from practical convenience, than the other. The first is, it arrogates to this House the control of the taxing power. Next, it assumes the power of forcing a penal Dissolution by refusing Supplies. Thirdly, there must be a new Parliament whenever the sitting Parliament has the misfortune to displease your Lordships' House. Fourthly, if these propositions of the Amendment are true, you are proposing to change representative supremacy into what I will venture to call&#x2014;I mean no offence by the word, but it is the true word&#x2014;you are changing representative supremacy into oligarchic and non-representative supremacy. Fifthly, this Amendment involves your throwing out of gear the whole finance machinery of the year.<lb/>
But that is not all. The policy of the Amendment would throw all the financial machinery of the time out of gear. It would do much more than that. What would it do? Our present system is that in Parliament the Government of the day proceed to consider the Estimates and Votes of the year. Those proposals, Estimates, and Votes are submitted to the House of Commons and the House of Commons decides upon them and accepts them. Then the Resolutions are passed and taxes are collected under the authority of these Resolutions by custom if not by law; taxes are collected, and all goes on in regular, well-understood, and well-established order until the Appropriation Bill is passed and the Resolutions become law.<lb/>
Let us see what will happen under the policy of this Amendment. It will be ridiculous for a Government or for the House of Commons to set to work in April when, for anything they know, by July they may be given to understand from important authorities in this House that this House is not at all likely to agree to those proposals. I hope I have made this position clear. If the Government with the confidence of the other House frames its proposals, the House accepts them, and the various officers concerned are working upon them; then if your Lordships do not pass the Finance Bill their
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0576"/>
<col>1139</col>
work will be fruitless. If that is going to be our system, so be it. I can imagine&#x2014;and I am not sure that there are not cases&#x2014;two Chambers having voices in finance. It might be so in this country if you make a tremendous revolution. That is not our system. Why cannot you have that system here under the present state of things? My Lords, I will venture to tell you why, and I will tell you, not in language of my own, which you might resent, but in language of one of the most eminent and respected leaders who ever sat in this House&#x2014;the late Lord Salisbury. This is the reason why you cannot have a working system founded on an agreement between the leaders in the House of Commons and the leaders in this House. This is what Lord Salisbury said in 1894. Speaking in your Lordships' House he said&#x2014;
<quote>" We belong too much to one class. The consequence is that in respect of a large number of questions we are all too much of one mind. That is a fact which appears to me to be injurious to the character of this House as a public assembly."</quote>
Those are words that I believe most of your Lordships fully admit in your hearts, and these are the reasons why you cannot, so long as you have two Parties' in this country, have a financial arrangement made by agreement between the two Houses.<lb/>
Now I have said you are assuming in this Amendment your right to call for a Dissolution of Parliament, and I was rather amazed at the noble Viscount (Lord Milner) on Friday last. Speaking at Glasgow, he said&#x2014;
<quote>" An autocratic House of Commons&#x2014;you cannot imagine what things it might do&#x2014;it might even prolong its own existence and repeal the Septennial Act."</quote>
as if repealing the Septennial Act were not the very operation that your Lordships are to-day performing&#x0021; I mean performing in spirit; you do not literally do it any more than a wild-cat House of Commons. This Parliament was elected in January, 1906, and would come to an end by the Septennial Act in 1912, or by established custom and practice in 1911; but you say to the House of Commons, "We do not like your Budget and so we will refuse Supplies, and in spite of the Septennial Act, and in spite of the prerogative of the Crown, we will send you back to the electors at the end of the fourth year." So do not let my noble friend talk of the sanctity of the Septennial Act.<lb/>
<col>1140</col>
What is the ground for taking this moment for digging up pretensions of the sort I have indicated in these five propositions? What is the ground for digging these pretensions out of their ancient sepulchres? If you adhered to unbroken precedent and the normal course of established and traditional practice, you would have accepted the provisions of the Budget as they have always been accepted; you would not have intercepted Supplies granted to the Crown by the House of Commons, and you would have left the House of Commons to run its course. The noble Marquess said thoughtful people were leaning undeniably towards Tariff Reform. So be it. Should we not have expected a Statesman with the destinies, not only of a Party, but of much more than a Party, in his hands, to be glad of more time to allow this process in the minds of thoughtful people to run its course, so that what is now only a leaning might ripen into a solid conviction, so that the currents in favour of Tariff Reform, which it now appears are running rapidly and satisfactorily to the noble Marquess, should be allowed time to broaden into a great main stream? I should have thought from my observation of Parliamentary tactics over a good long time that that would have been the reasonable and judicious course from the Tariff Reform point of view. Time also might have given us an opportunity for enabling us to understand a little more of what Tariff Reform is to which we are now leaning. But apart from that, would it not have been, in the ordinary views of political strategy and political tactics, wiser to have let the alleged transitory mischiefs of the Budget run their course, and then have taken your appeal to the wearied and exasperated electorate? That would have been, I confess, my own view.<lb/>
I have listened with respectful attention during the course of this debate, and I should like to deal, if I may, with what appeared to me to be the grounds of support given to this Amendment. The first is this, that this House has the right to reject the Budget Bill. The bare legal right has not been denied. Some, no doubt&#x2014;and I do not know that I would quarrel with them&#x2014;would argue that the bare legal right may, on certain occasions, be appropriately transformed into a moral duty. Yes, but I can imagine a state of things&#x2014;I can imagine it with difficulty&#x2014;which would
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0577"/>
<col>1141</col>
justify the transformation of a legal right into aspects of moral duty by reason of the wild-cat proposals of a demented House of Commons.<lb/>
I will try to show that that case has not yet arisen. There has been no serious attempt to show that the assertion of this bare right, by foisting a constitutional crisis upon the top of a financial deadlock, is in any way provident, sensible, or likely to serve one single useful end. Nobody pretends&#x2014;and I am sure the most ardent of noble Lords opposite does not pretend&#x2014;that there is an absolute security that this shrill, this unexpected assertion of a bare right, a barren right, will produce the results which you desire. Then it comes to this&#x2014;as was said in a phrase used by a man so guarded and careful in his language as my right hon. friend the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;that your Amendment is a gambler's throw. I venture to associate myself with Sir Edward Grey in the characterisation of this operation. We are told&#x2014;I have seen it in some of the prints which support noble Lords opposite&#x2014;the old historic situation of Lords and Commons is now entirely reversed. It is the House of Lords which is now the champion of the popular rights against what the noble Marquess, quoting Cromwell, called the "horridest arbitrariness of the House of Commons"; and I have seen it stated that the noble Marquess is the John Hampden of the twentieth century. If I agreed with that I should certainly think I was paying the noble Marquess a very great compliment. But I do not myself take that view at all of the operation which is now proceeding.<lb/>
I do not believe that anybody will soberly contend that by throwing out this Budget you are asserting popular rights. And I am a better Whig than the noble Marquess. He will remember the name of a predecessor of his illustrious political line&#x2014;Lord Shelburne. Lord Shelburne said in 1778&#x2014;and apparently his view has descended to the noble Marquess&#x2014;
<quote>" I shall continue to be of opinion that your Lordships have a right to alter, to amend, or to reject a Money Bill, and I say that this House is equally with the House of Commons representative of the people."</quote>
Yes, but there was a greater man even than Lord Shelburne, eminent as he was, and that was Burke. What did Burke say to Lord Shelburne? He said of the House of Commons&#x2014;
<col>1142</col>
<quote>" We are the sole representatives of the people. The Lords have no right to the disposition, in any sense, of the public purse."</quote>
I commend respectfully to the noble Marquess the perusal of some of the writings of that illustrious Whig. I really do not know where you will find any serious authority, certainly within the last 100 years, for depriving the House of Commons of the sole control of the taxing power.<lb/>
I now come to another point. You say that we, the Government, have no mandate. You say this Budget was never brought before the electors in January, 1906. Well, I am myself utterly averse to these, what I call foreign, ideas. Lord Balfour of Burleigh spoke of this in a speech of which I may perhaps be permitted to say that it was a speech of which, whether you agree with its conclusions or not, by its ability, by its disinterestedness, and by its transparent sincerity, any political assembly in the world might have been proud. He remonstrated with the doctrine of <i>mandat imp&#x00E9;ralif</i>, and all the rest of the jargon; but he, I think, employed it in regard to the relation of a member to his electors. I go further. I may recall that in 1902, when noble Lords opposite brought in their Education Bill, it was a common taunt or remonstrance on the part of many of my political friends that the election of 1900, which placed them in office, was a war-election, and that they had no mandate. I dissociated myself then from my political friends, and I hold firmly that all this idea of an election <i>ad hoc</i>, of a referendum, a <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i>, and a mandate is a complete departure from the wholesome usages of this country.<lb/>
I particularly, for my part, object to the referendum. Why? Because it weakens what is the most important thing for this country to maintain&#x2014;the sense of responsibility in the House of Commons. If you tell the House of Commons that they are liable to have a given conclusion of their own submitted to other people&#x2014;whether they be members of this House or people in the country&#x2014;you weaken their own personal individual and collective responsibility. What I say as to mandate, and this is my view after pretty careful consideration, is that no doubt you may have an election where a Minister and a Party have a majority to do one particular thing, as, for example, Mr. Gladstone in 1868 to carry the disestablishment of the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0578"/>
<col>1143</col>
Irish Church, or Sir Robert Peel in 1841 to maintain the Corn Law&#x2014;a mandate which was not entirely respected. A Minister and a Party may have a mandate to do one particular thing, but my argument is that that carries with it no sort of exclusion from that Parliament's doing any other thing which it considers it right and fit to do. I believe that is sound doctrine. My view is that when an elector goes to the poll he is voting for the House of Commons to make laws, to watch administration, to support a Minister or a Party for a certain number of years in Parliament&#x2014;and more often, by the way, partiality for a Minister has at least as much to do with the decision as his particular enthusiasm for any particular question. I think our electoral history will show that, and I say that a Parliament so chosen is not, and cannot be, fettered in any matters with which it thinks fit to deal. Therefore I will brush aside the argument that we have no mandate.<lb/>
By this Amendment you are subjecting the Budget to what is called, in the jargon to which I have referred, a <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i>. If there is any one matter which cannot be usefully or wisely submitted to a <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i> it is a Budget. It is one of those things on which you cannot say, Yes or No. How can any one say Yes or No to this Budget? Noble Lords here do not like the Budget, but the Budget contains any number of provisions, qualifications, intricacies; it is a complex of things to which you cannot give a plain Yes or No, which is the point of a <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i>. Therefore, if anybody says he thinks the Budget is a good thing for a plebiscitary operation it can only be because he has not well mastered the practice of referendums and <i>pl&#x00E9;biscites</i>. The electors can undoubtedly demand a financial policy. They can demand, for example, though I think it would be an evil day, Tariff Reform. So be it. They can demand a policy. They can punish a Minister by dismissing him when the time comes. What they cannot do, I submit, is to break into the middle of a fully-planned executive scheme for supplying the public needs of the year&#x2014;three-quarters of which year, by the way, at this moment have expired. The electors must trust those whom they have elected to the present House of Commons; they must acquiesce in the action of their own representatives who have had the whole case before them, all the facts, conditions, arguments, possibilities,
<col>1144</col>
who have fixed the Estimates and decided on the ways and means for satisfying them.<lb/>
Now another point. It is argued that you will vote for this Amendment because you want to arrest Socialism. I am, and always have been, a pretty strong individualist. But just let us look at these Socialist allegations and the assumption that by rejecting this Bill and passing your Amendment you are putting a spoke into the wheel of Socialism. The people of this country are either of the predatory species or they are not; they are either in favour of predatory, destructive Socialism or they are not. If they are, it is quite certain that the success of this Parliamentary operation of your Lordships will not set up any dam or rampart or barrier against the great destructive flood such as would then arise. Anyone who tells you that by passing this Amendment you are obstructing Socialism is as foolish as were the courtiers of King Canute. But I do not believe, and I am quite sure all your Lordships do not believe, that our countrymen are a predatory species. No Englishman can think so.<lb/>
If you will forgive a passing personal reference, it was my fortune to be&#x2014;I only mention it to show that I am not talking of the working people of this country with a Utopian head in the clouds&#x2014;for twelve years a Member for what was in those days one of the largest constituencies in England. It was an enormous constituency, and my return was always due to the skilled artisans, mainly workers in the famous Elswick factory&#x2014;skilled and admirable artisans. It is true that at the end of twelve years they turned me out, but I had plenty of time&#x2014;and I am not entirely without the faculty of observation&#x2014;to satisfy myself that the skilled artisan of this country, aye, and many more than they, are not men wearing the Phrygian cap. No, they are not "Reds." Then, what is it you are so afraid of under your designation of Socialism? Suppose I am wrong. Suppose that a dangerous Socialistic tide is running, then I put this question to your Lordships: Is it wisdom, is it political sagacity, does it show that circumspection which we have a right to look for in this House, to take ground which must, however unfounded you may declare that it is, and however unfounded it may be, expose you to the charge that you are
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0579"/>
<col>1145</col>
straining the Constitution, and straining it as champions of the rich against the poor? Electioneering is rough-and-ready work.<lb/>
I should have thought it was well worthy of the consideration of the noble Marquess and his friends, whether, if you be right and if there be a dangerous tide of Socialism running, and going to run, it is wise of you to take up a position which exposes you to a suspicion, and a charge of that kind. My own view about the present aspects of Socialism is that there is, as the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said the other night, a great feeling prevailing quite beyond the lines of Party in this country at present of pity, of sympathy, and of horror at the miseries which our industrial system entails. We all feel it. I have never, I think, heard in my life a more moving speech than I heard in this House from the Bishop of Southwark when he was talking about the word "unemployable," and about people describing the unemployed as unemployable. A more noble vindication of this emotion of pity and sympathy I have never heard, and it is sound.<lb/>
There will, no doubt, be foolish proposals made by the pitiful and sympathetic, whether politicians or philanthropists outside politics&#x2014;there will be proposals made, if you like, full of charlatanry and full of quackery. But, anyhow, it is inevitable to anybody who has followed the course of movements of a Socialistic kind in France and other countries that you should have these experiments tried. My own hope, my own conviction, is that at the end of these experiments there will be left behind a fertile and fertilising residue of good. Mill, whose name has been so often quoted in these debates on fiscal matters, said at the very end of his life he was averse to Socialism, and in a certain production of his, where he described the possible dangers of Socialism, he said&#x2014;
<quote>" If Socialism with all its dangers was the only alternative to the horrors of our present system I would be a Socialist."</quote>
The noble Viscount, Lord Milner, said the other day that he would be very sorry to be a member of a dummy House of Lords, and I suppose any one who sits in an assembly, however new a comer he may be, would be very sorry to sit in a dummy assembly. He would rather absent himself altogether. But there is something worse than a dummy House of Lords, and that is a dummy House of Commons. What else
<col>1146</col>
does this operation which you are going to consummate to-morrow night mean than reducing the House of Commons to a dummy? They discussed the Budget for six months. I forget how many hundreds of sittings and how many hundreds of Divisions there were. I understand from those who speak with a certain impartiality that it was discussed with a freedom and a fulness of detail almost, if not entirely, without precedent in our recent Parliamentary annals. In the course of that prolonged ordeal it was not transformed in principle, but it was transformed, changed, and amplified in detail.<lb/>
Nothing has surprised me more in listening to this important debate than the curious argument which is drawn from the fact that the Government accepted a great many Amendments, and literally had 250 Amendments of their own at the last stage. But suppose the Government had accepted no Amendments, or very few, or suppose they had not listened to any representations, then we should, of course, have heard here the other regulation set of observations made on these occasions. We should have been told that this was a most imperious Government, most unconciliatory, most perverse, and all the rest of it. There was no guillotine. There were ceaseless interviews with deputations, and yet all this prolonged and careful labour, discussion, thought, contrivance&#x2014;all that is to go for nothing, and all its results are to be pulverised and brought to naught by a trenchant sweep of the noble Marquess's arm. That is what I call making a dummy House of Commons.<lb/>
In the Division on the Third Reading, what were the numbers? They were 379 for the Budget Bill and 149 against it. In this House, to-morrow night, let us suppose it is 500 against fifty. My Lords, the more triumphant your majority, the more huge the disparity between your numbers and ours, the more flagrant the political scandal, and the more blazing in the public eye the Constitutional paradox. Such a contrast as that, 379 against 149 in one House, only a four-year-old House, and 400 or 500 in this House against forty or fifty&#x2014;I say it cannot last. You may argue as you like about rights. You may say, as the noble and learned ex-Lord Chancellor did, in a genial speech which we enjoyed, all the more because the force of argument was not destructive of the Bill, that the word "Constitution" may be an idle and spurious catch-word on our lips, full of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0580"/>
<col>1147</col>
sound and fury, but signifying nothing. But that paradox cannot be. It is against common sense. It is against the course and operation of things. It cannot be.<lb/>
I will ask you to listen to what the eminent and accomplished man who leads the Opposition in the other House said&#x2014;
<quote>" It is the House of Commons, not the House of Lords, which settles uncontrolled our financial system. It is the House of Commons, and not the House of Lords, which determines by its vote whether such and such a Minister should continue to have such a measure of general confidence as would justify the Sovereign in further employing him. I am a House of Commons man."</quote>
I do believe that this notion that you can deprive the House of Commons of its power, that you can so interfere with the exercise of its power as to amount to a practical deprivation, is the most rash dream that has ever made its appearance in the politics of this country since the days of the Fifth Monarchy men in the seventeenth century. I do not believe that the Fifth Monarchy men were a bit more dreamers than noble Lords opposite who sit in this place and think that they can override the House of Commons.<lb/>
Your prominent reason for this Amendment, which I must call a revolutionary proposal, is that the Budget itself bristles with revolutionary proposals. But, my Lords, does it? It is very easy to use the word "revolutionary," but you must begin by remembering, if you will, that we are in an era, quite independent of this year and quite independent of the Budget, of a deficit of sixteen to eighteen million pounds. Such a deficit I should think has never been seen&#x2014;I will not commit myself to that, but a deficit of sixteen or seventeen or eighteen millions constitutes the beginning of momentous finance. Let me first take the increases in the Income Tax and the Death Duties. What did Mr. Balfour say upon them? Did he say that they were revolutionary and would justify a revolution in our Constitution? This is what Mr. Balfour said on the Third Reading of the Bill on the 4th of this month&#x2014;
<quote>" There was a Division in the House of Commons against the Super Tax, but there was no division against the Income Tax or the Death Duties, so I am informed, either in Committee or on Report. Though, as I told the House before, I do see great danger in these taxes, I have always held one language on this subject from the first day that I spoke in April last till now."</quote>
And these are the words to which I invite your Lordships' attention&#x2014;
<col>1148</col>
<quote>" I quite admit that if there is no other way of finding the necessary resources for carrying on the work of this country and fulfilling its obligations, you must have recourse to Income Tax and to Death Duties to an amount and of a character which would have horrified every great financier, Liberal or Conservative, in the past."</quote>
Therefore, my Lords, you see that Mr. Balfour, at all events, did not find the proposals affecting Death Duties and Income Tax revolutionary.<lb/>
Then there is graduation. That is thought by many members of your Lordships' House to be revolutionary. Is it? There is no new principle in graduation. The Income Tax was always graduated from Pitt's time till the present. Up till 1906 the principle of graduation was only applied to small incomes. But if it is right and not revolutionary to graduate the tax upon incomes up to &#x00A3;1,000 a year, say, what is there revolutionary in extending the principle to incomes of &#x00A3;10,000 a year? And, mark this, these Death Duties and Income Tax are not fastened on the shoulders of either rich or poor for all eternity. They are revocable at the first moment noble Lords opposite and their Party come into power. They may then cut down the Death Duties, they may lower the Income Tax, they may do whatever they will, but I hope that I shall be allowed to see their perplexities if they make any attempt of that kind. As to the Super Tax, Mr. Pitt thought 2<i>s</i>. in the &#x00A3; not too much for even moderate incomes in an emergency to pay, and for seventeen years it was paid. But we call on nobody now, I think, to pay more than 1<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. Now as to the licensing proposals. What is there revolutionary there? There is no revolution. The new scale of licensing duties may be good or it may be bad; it may be open to criticism and objection. I dare say it is. It would be very odd if it were not. All proposals of this kind are open to objection, but no revolution. It used, I think, to be the practice to charge fifty per cent. licence duty on the smaller houses and a lower duty on the larger houses. This Budget equalises those duties. And may I remind your Lordships that Lord St. Aldwyn&#x2014;who, by the way, I have been so accustomed to see in financial debates for so many years that I quite miss him on this occasion&#x2014;when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer admitted that the scale was inadequate for the larger houses? It is therefore a question of degree, and there is no revolution there.<lb/>

<col>1149</col>
As for the taxes on land, I certainly will not invite the House to embark on that formidable and complex theme, not because I am afraid but because it would take a great deal too much time. But I will Kay this, that there is no principle in the land proposals for which you will not find the authority of writers of the highest and accepted repute. Mr. Gladstone has been referred to, and we have been told, inside this House and outside, that Mr. Gladstone would have made short work of this precious Budget if it had come near him. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne's, praise of Mr. Gladstone was delightful to me to hear, because I very often heard him years ago take another line, quite naturally. But when that great and famous man was happily among us&#x2014;I think the noble Marquess who served under him will agree with me&#x2014;it was not always the easiest and simplest tiling in the world to be quite sure, after he had listened to arguments, upon which side he would come down. Therefore, I have listened with amazement to the confidence with which, not only in this House but in the newspapers, it has been said: "If Mr. Gladstone were here he would make short work of all of you, and we wonder you who knew him do not blush at accepting responsibility for proposals which he would have pronounced as most pernicious." The first of a great many conflicts that Mr. Gladstone had with this House was upon the Succession Duties. It is all very well now to say what a great man he was and what a wise Statesman, but let me call your Lordships' attention to the language that was used in this House about the Succession Duties. When land was made to pay like other forms of property, the Succession Duties were called "essentially impracticable," "unjust," "cowardly," "absurd," "one of the most detestable and odious measures ever proposed," "he is a vulture soaring over society waiting for those to die so that he may appropriate their goods." My Lords, this vulture has now become an eagle or a swan, and who knows, such are the chances and changes of our modern life, whether some of the very young members of the present House may not live to see the day when our present Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is now little liked here, may undergo the same conversion.<lb/>
Now if I am not wearying the House, I should like to say a word about the very able and interesting speech which was
<col>1150</col>
delivered the other night by my noble friend Lord Revelstoke. It was a most interesting speech, but I do think that the noble Lord fell into the great human fallacy of attributing to one cause effects really due not to one cause alone but to a multiplicity of causes; and to me it seems quite astounding, and I am not entirely unversed in economic matters, that anybody in his great position and with his experience should dream that the Budget alone would produce all the phenomena which he described with so much power. Let us look at the facts. He complains that we, the present Government, are injuring British credit. Let us look at it. From 1898 to 1905 Consols fell from 113 to eighty-nine. He dwelt upon that. But, my Lords, experts toll me that there are three causes to account for that. First there was the increase of the Debt for the Boer War&#x2014;a war which my noble friend on the Woolsack and I, at all events, have no responsibility for. Secondly, there was the extension of trustee securities, which was done not by us but by the late Government; and, thirdly, there was the Irish Land Act of 1903. Those three factors are still operating, and I might remark in passing that the two European Powers who are now suffering most from the burden of armaments&#x2014;namely, Great Britain and Germany&#x2014;are the two powers who also for the last few years have been suffering most in the matter of credit. Let me criticise, if I may, the view the noble Lord took about these figures of Income Tax, in order to revive the courage of your Lordships and of the country. The gross amount which came under the review of the Income lax Commissioners for the year 1898&#x2013;9 was &#x00A3;762,000,000. In the year 1908&#x2013;9 that &#x00A3;762,000,000 had risen to &#x00A3;980,000,000&#x2014;that is to say, nearly &#x00A3;220,000,000 increase in ten years. I know the noble Lord will say that I have not allowed for the greater efficiency of collection so I will allow for that a quarter, or, if you like, I will be very handsome and will allow that one half of that &#x00A3;220,000,000 of increase was due to expedited collection. The Income Tax payers of this country, who only number 1,100,000, were, therefore, better off, even knocking off the &#x00A3;110,000,000 for better collection, by &#x00A3;110,000,000 a year than they were at the beginning of the previous ten years. The Death Duty figures, I admit, do not fully sustain the same conclusion as would arise from the Income Tax figures, but there they are.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0582"/>
<col>1151</col>
Now, my Lords, let us look for one moment at other figures from the Board of Trade returns. During the last ten years ten million persons, the aristocracy, so to call them, of skilled labour, increased their annual wage by about &#x00A3;10,000,000, nearly the whole of which has been attained during the last four years; but you have to set off against that a steady rise of rents, and some rise, tolerably recently, in the price of food. I do not pretend to have exhaustively dealt with the noble Lord's case, but I have pointed out that it must be taken with a discount; and I go on to ask this, Were we at this hour of momentous finance, when we are bound to look wherever we can, with justice and equity, to find resources to raise the money required by the State from the funds of wealth or from the nearly stationary wages of labour? I beg your Lordships to ask yourselves, if any of you were Chancellor of the Exchequer and that question were propounded to you, whether you would be in a hurry to answer it. You would, I think, come to the same mind as the mind of the present Government, and that the substantial justice of the Budget proposals are, to some degree at all events, vindicated by figures of that kind. My Lords, I have detained you too long. I only want to say that I do not feel&#x2014;and I say it with all deference and respect&#x2014;that the policy of this Amendment has been thought out to all the ulterior conclusions that it contains. Many members of this House evidently agree with that view. One noble Lord who always interests the House, Lord Newton, said that they had been "jockeyed"&#x2014;I think that was the expression&#x2014;into this Amendment. Who jockeyed them I did not gather.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03636"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: Lloyd-George.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03637"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Without going into personal points, because this is not merely a personal matter, it is a very significant fact that four of the most powerful speakers who have addressed your Lordships from that side of the House and from the Cross Benches will not follow the noble Marquess into the Lobby. I do not say at all, and have never promised, that this Budget will bring right away the Millennium, but I am quite certain that it will not bring Pandemonium. It will bring neither the Millennium nor Pandemonium, and I think that noble Lords opposite are beginning
<col>1152</col>
to feel that perhaps their apprehensions were unduly aroused. Let me make one observation to which I believe the noble Marquess will attach certain weight. When Mr. Gladstone was going through his early financial operations he was watched by nobody in the world with a more eager interest than by Cavour. I am not speaking quite without the book when I say that there are now Ministers in European countries, with their own battles to fight, who are watching with some anxiety and some apprehension the double issue, fiscal and constitutional, in which we are involved by these proceedings. For many glorious generations England has been the stable and far-shining model of reform, and any clouding of her position in either fiscal or constitutional policy will be a gain, and a heavy gain, on the Continent of Europe to the parties of reaction. I may say that in the part of the world with which I am for the moment very responsibly connected&#x2014;India&#x2014;they are watching us, I do not mean to say the malcontents merely, and there is great interest taken in all our changes of fiscal view. I do not envy the Indian Government of the future, if you accept what is at the back of this Amendment&#x2014;a new fiscal policy&#x2014;I do not envy the Government which will have to deal with the claim of the Indians to have their tariff reformed too.<lb/>
Lastly, the noble Marquess must have foreseen that the success of this Amendment and its consequences must lead a pretty straight way to constitutional revision, and I am sure he must know that there is no such battle ground, if you look at our own history in the seventeenth century, at the modern history of the United States, or at that of half the countries of Continental Europe, for the fiercest and most determined conflicts as constitutional revision. With regard to the Second Chamber, I venture to call it the <i>pons asinorum</i> of democracy. I hope noble Lords will recognise that. The scene in this House during the last ten days must not, I think, be counted one of those brilliant and exciting stage plays, political and party stage plays, of which some of us have seen so many. I think it is much more than a mere stage play. It is the first step on a tremendous journey, and, as we all know, when we troop off home to-morrow night we shall not think that, though the theatre is empty, the curtain has fallen upon a completed drama. We shall all know in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0583"/>
<col>1153</col>
our hearts that the note has sounded for a very angry and perhaps prolonged battle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03638"><member>LORD ROTHSCHILD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I venture to rise to say a few words after listening to the eloquent speech of the noble Viscount, I can promise you that I shall only detain you for a very short time, knowing full well that nothing I can say will influence the votes and decisions of any of your Lordships. But I think it right that your Lordships should know what I believe to be the views of the majority of those citizens of London whose avocations take them daily into the City. When I talk of the City I do not mean only the members of the Stock Exchange and those who noble Lords opposite seem to think frequent Capel Court and Shorter's Court, but I am talking of men who are associated with the trade and commerce of this great country, without which trade and commerce England could not exist. My Lords, the City fully recognises that whatever expenditure may have been incurred, and whatever expenditure for whatever purposes may be necessary, it should bear its full share, and more than its full share, of that expenditure, so that the taunts which are levelled at the City that it advocates expenditure which it is not willing to bear its proportion of are groundless.<lb/>
The City objects to and criticises many of the provisions of the Budget because it believes that those provisions would undermine credit and destroy confidence and in that way would impair the resources to which every Chancellor of the Exchequer looks for the greater part of his revenue. Although not directly interested in land, whether urban or rural, the City objects to the taxes which it is proposed to levy on land because it believes that it is the first time in the financial history of this country that taxes on capital are to be levied in that way, and that at not infrequent intervals what is called a portion of the unearned increment is to become the property of the State. The City objected to the Land Taxes when they were introduced, because it was proposed to levy those taxes on the bare word of officials without appeal to the law. It objects to them now because these taxes are to be levied and an appeal to the law is only to be allowed at a later period, whenever that may be, when the valuation is made. My Lords, when these taxes were first introduced to the public notice
<col>1154</col>
they were advocated, I think, on the ground that they would affect a very few people&#x2014;in fact, I may say, a very small number of your Lordships' House. Since then it has been reluctantly granted that the number of landowners was 250,000, and afterwards that number was increased to 1,000,000. Among the million are several insurance companies, and the largest landowner in the administrative county of London, is, I believe, an insurance company. But quite apart from the land which insurance companies may hold, there is not an insurance company, there is not a friendly society, there is not a building society, there is no society of an analogous nature, that has not lent very large sums of money on land mortgages. If future legislation were to impose heavier taxes on land, the mortgages which form part of the security or the assets of 30,000,000 of policy holders might be seriously impaired.<lb/>
But quite apart from the future. Unemployment is always looming before your Lordships' House, and one of the causes, in my opinion, of unemployment at present is the great difficulty that builders have, not because land is held up, as is often said in this House, but because of the difficulty they have of borrowing money, which they used to do with great ease. My Lords, the Super Tax has been severely criticised in the City; I will not say for its amount, but it is believed that by the Super lax a new kind of Holy Inquisition is being set up which will pry into every one's affairs. I received a few days ago a letter from a friend of mine, a gentleman of high standing and deserved popularity in the City of London. He is a gentleman who prides himself on having been&#x2014;and he still is&#x2014;a lifelong Liberal. With your permission, my Lords, I will read his letter. This gentleman writes&#x2014;
<quote>" In the case of ordinary Income Tax assessments are made by additional Commissioners, while the right of appeal if allowed to an independent body or the general Commissioners of the district, generally consisting of gentlemen of high standing and position in the neighbourhood. In the case of the Super Tax the only appeal allowed is to the Special Commissioners. That is the same body against whose assessment it is desired to appeal. There is, therefore, no appeal to any independent or impartial body on questions of fact, though on questions of law a special case can be demanded to the Courts. Thus, in the case of the Super Tax, an assessment can be arbitrarily made by paid officials, the appeal heard, and the duty collected without the intervention or control of any impartial body. There is, I believe, no similar instance of such powers in the levying of any tax."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0584"/>
<col>1155</col>
It is not necessary for me to read the whole letter. My friend writes that this is a novel principle. To my mind this setting up of independent bodies above the law is the chief plank in the platform of all the proposed legislation of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
My Lords, I might, if I trespassed on your kind indulgence, criticise many more of the details of the Budget, but my chief object in rising this evening was to point out to your Lordships what is the effect of these Budget proposals. It is evident to any one in the City that there has been a very large efflux of capital. That efflux of capital differs very considerably from the raising in this country of foreign loans for a Government or for any of those enterprises like the railway in Argentina, so ably fathered by the noble Lord, Lord St. David's, opposite. I think I am right in asserting that my grandfather was called to give evidence before a Committee of your Lordships' House, at the beginning of the last century after the great war. My grandfather told your Lordships then that the raising of foreign loans in this country had two effects. Of the money raised he asserted that a large portion was spent in British manufactures, that the money sent home for interest and sinking fund sometimes came in specie, but oftener in goods and in produce; and he pointed out to their Lordships then that the raising of foreign loans was essentially beneficial to the trade and commerce of this country. No one disputes that at the present moment. And it is not at all necessary for your Lordships to listen to assertions of that kind on both sides of the House. In the newspapers last week it was stated that the Government of the Argentine Republic, imitating other Governments, had ordered twelve destroyers, and so as to make no difference between the three countries from which they had borrowed they ordered four in England, four in France, and four in Germany. What was true, as my grandfather told your Lordships' Committee then, is true now.<lb/>
I noticed the other day that Mr. Haldane told a company of young men at a luncheon that if English money sought foreign investment it was because there was a plethora of money in this country and we did not know what to do with it. I can tell Mr. Haldane, from my limited experience, that, while it is very easy to get money for foreign investments, it is
<col>1156</col>
difficult, if not impossible, to obtain those sums for even the best English enterprises. If I understood the noble Lord, Lord St. David's, accurately the other evening, he said that the depression of English securities was due to the aftermath of the war in South Africa. I wonder if the noble Lord thinks that the recuperative power of England is less than the recuperative powers of Russia and Japan. I know he does not think so. How then does he account for the fact that since the peace in the Transvaal all English securities have depreciated, while since the end of the struggle between Russia and Japan, Russian and Japanese securities have improved, although Russia and Japan may have borrowed since then as much as the noble Viscount says England has?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03639"><sup>*</sup>VISCOUNT MIDLETON: My Lords, I think there will be common consent that the two speeches to which we have listened to-night have maintained the debate at the high level of tone and of interest which it has reached during the preceding four or five days, and I am glad that His Majesty's Government appear to concur in that view. I noticed that a distinguished member of the Government, speaking three or four days ago&#x2014;had to deal with rather a difficult audience and with a considerable amount of interruption at the back of the hall, and after complaining of the unreasoning hyena-like cat calls, he said, discussing the debate in your Lordships' House, that the debate here was being conducted with a levity which he could only compare to the levity at the back of that hall. If the First Lord of the Admiralty continues his speaking on that level, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade and even the Lord Advocate may have to look to their laurels.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03640">To-night we have been treated to a somewhat different display, but I wonder whether the noble Viscount, in the long list with which he began his speech of the changes which would be made in the relations of the two Houses by the brief Amendment which has been submitted to your Lordships, has really considered the relations between cause and effect. He accuses us of arrogating to ourselves taxing power, of forcing a penal Dissolution, and also of establishing an oligarchy in substitution for the representation of the people. But how can we be arrogating to ourselves the decision upon this Budget? How
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0585"/>
<col>1157</col>
can we be said to be establishing an oligarchy by inviting popular opinion at a General Election upon these financial proposals? The noble Viscount may remember a passage in which it was written that even religious fanaticism could not exercise a greater tyranny than the domination of a single Chamber, and I was rather surprised at the use which he made of his own view regarding the doctrine of the mandate. It is quite true that in the last Parliament the noble Viscount was not one of those who pressed strongly in the House of Commons the view that the late Government had no mandate after the conclusion of the war. But on how many nights was that Government faced with strong objection to their taking any action whatever because they had no mandate&#x2014;not to take action to impose taxation which must continue over many years, but to prevent their even holding views with regard to future taxation which they had undertaken never to submit to that Parliament before they had been the subject of decision by the constituencies?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03641">On the first night of the debate the Lord Chancellor laid down that our action, though not illegal, would be unconstitutional. The unconstitutional theory has been entirely abandoned to-night. I venture to think that from the moment the Lord Chancellor admitted that our action would be legal, he left the domain of law, in which he is master, and came into the domain of custom, with regard to which your Lordships have some right to an opinion; and in the domain of custom, from the moment that Lord Salisbury adduced, in, as I thought, a most admirable speech, the opinion given last session by the Lord Chancellor with regard to the rejection of Money Bills, the whole question of unconstitutional action fell to the ground. My Lords, I wish that with it some of the unsound financial theories which have been advanced in favour of this Bill had also fallen to the ground. The theory to which we object with regard to this Budget is one which is absolutely novel in our political history. The old financial theory was that you should spread your taxation over the broadest basis, and levy it where it would least be felt. That is not the theory on which this Budget is based. The theory on which the Budget is based is that you should spread your taxation over the narrowest basis and levy it where it will most be felt. There is not a Chancellor of the Exchequer who in this generation
<col>1158</col>
has brought forward a Budget who has not pointed out, wherever he found a tax would lose in elasticity, that that tax was in itself in jeopardy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03642">But what did we hear from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack the other day? It was so good an illustration of the view of the Government that I trust I may be pardoned for pointing it out. The noble and learned Lord spoke of the Whisky Duty, and had before him the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the enhanced Whisky Duty had lost something like &#x00A3;500,000 in the first few months, a sum which the Chancellor of the Exchequer said could never be recovered. It was gone for ever. But the noble and learned Lord said that among the indirect and most valuable results of the Budget had been the large diminution in the consumption of spirits since these taxes were imposed. This is a Budget brought forward, as we are told, not to penalise any particular individuals. It is not brought forward as a measure for improving the deficient morality of the people, but for filling up a depleted exchequer; and here we have a Budget on which there is unanimity in the Cabinet, and on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer told us that the best intellects of the Cabinet had been engaged for many months&#x2014;this Budget, which has lost in the first few months a sum of nearly a million of money, which has involved a further raid on the Sinking Fund, and has been followed by a further fall in Consols, is cited with satisfaction by the noble and learned Lord. We all, of course, admire him as a humanitarian and as a social reformer. It may be very good morality, but I submit that it is very bad finance. Again, it is not merely what is said by the Government, but what is not said.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03643">We have listened to four important speeches from high financial authorities on this side of the House, not the least important of which was delivered by Lord Rothschild. What answer have we heard? The noble Viscount, I admit, has brought forward various arguments to-night. He suggested a number of reasons, including the great expenditure on the war and the increased number of securities made available for trust investments. But how does he meet Lord Rothschild's contention that while the stocks of other countries like Russia and Japan, after an equally great or greater strain, have gone up, our Government
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0586"/>
<col>1159</col>
stocks have gone down? If I might add one little illustration to show that confidence does do something for credit, will the noble Viscount or one of his colleagues tell me how they account for this very curious fact, which has not yet been mentioned to your Lordships. Two years and a-half ago the ratepayers of the metropolis&#x2014;whose Budget is the largest in this country with the exception of the National Budget, spending as they do between twelve millions and fifteen millions a year&#x2014;reversed the policy of the previous eighteen years and returned a reform party with the object of reducing expenditure, which object may, to some extent, have been carried out. How did the stock of the London County Council&#x2014;the largest stock, I believe, in this country with the exception of the National Stock&#x2014;stand? The three and a-half per cents. stood at ninety-seven at that date. My Lords, while Consols have gone down six points, while India Stock has fallen three or four points in the last three or four years, while Local Loans Stock is not buoyant, while Irish Land Stock has fallen in a greater proportion&#x2014;while every Government security has suffered, the London County Council stocks have risen four points and have been maintained at an average of between four and five points higher since the change of policy which has given confidence, and, therefore, improved credit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03644">I am not going to travel again over ground which has been already traversed. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War, who is not now in his place, accounted for these curious manifestations on the part of the City by saying that the City was very frequently wrong, and he illustrated that&#x2014;I must say in an argument which I thought was an insufficient one&#x2014;by elaborately comparing how stocks stood during the war in South Africa before battles in which we happened to be unsuccessful and battles in which we were successful. He instanced Spion Kop. I would like to deal with that for one moment, and to say that in my opinion the City takes a longer view than the noble Lord gives it credit for. If before the action at Spion Kop Consols rose, it was not because of the immediate effect which might be believed to be coming about from the advent in South Africa of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal on the Cross Benches, but owing also to the knowledge that from every part of the
<col>1160</col>
world tens of thousands of troops were being poured into South Africa and the absolute determination on the part of the country to go through with the war at whatever cost. In the same way I venture to think that it is insufficient to say that this great fall of investments at home is due, as Lord St. David's suggested, to the increased facilities for investment abroad. I pass lightly over that point, because the answer is so obvious when we ask ourselves the question, "Why has this change come over investors, not over an average of five or ten years, but within the last few months? "It is solely, as we believe, in consequence of the provisions of this Budget.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03645">If I may trouble you with a very few figures I should like to do so in order to correct what I think was a very grave error on the part of the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, the cause of whose absence to-day I am sure all your Lordships deplore. Lord Pentland made a speech of a character of which I think we have had too many outside&#x2014;that is to say, of representing this Budget as if it were a campaign of the poor against the rich. At the least we have the right to ask that the figures should be accurately given in the description of the Budget. Lord Pentland said that the extra burden laid by this Budget on a man with 30<i>s</i>. a week was 2<i>d</i>. in the pound, and on a man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year 5<i>d</i>. in the pound, and he proceeded to say, in words which I really should like to read to your Lordships, that he thought in the one case&#x2014;that was, in the &#x00A3;5,000 a year case&#x2014;it merely meant some slight subtraction from the margin of income spent on luxury or ease or what they pleased, and that it could not be maintained that a man with &#x00A3;5,000 a year could not well afford 5<i>d</i>. in the pound as compared with the 2<i>d</i>. in the pound of the man with 30<i>s</i>. a week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03646">May I give an illustration of what the figures really are? I had through my hands the other day as trustee a trust estate, and I had an actuarial calculation made on what a man of the age of fifty would have to pay throughout the whole of his life on his estate, and what his contributions would be to the burdens of the country. I think these figures will bear any amount of inspection. I know that the Government will not maintain that the Death Duties on land are all to be paid out of capital. We have heard from the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0587"/>
<col>1161</col>
noble Earl, the Lord Steward, who made so admirable a speech, that these things can be done by a very slight sacrifice by insurance, but his figures were rather difficult to follow. I would instance these figures for the noble Earl's attention. This is the actuarial calculation that I had made. This particular estate, I must mention, happened to pay three per cent. extra. Sixty years before it had descended by a settlement made by an uncle; it had gone to a father and a son, and the man inherited from his grandfather; but still there was three per cent. extra, and so the estate paid ten per cent. The whole amount paid before this Budget was introduced was 1<i>s</i>. in the pound in Income Tax and 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in Death Duties&#x2014;or 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Under this particular scheme he will pay an extra 8<i>d</i>. in Income Tax and an extra 1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in Death Duties. His total contribution, therefore, to the Exchequer for the whole period of his life of fifty years is 6<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in the pound. I ask your Lordships to realise first of all that the addition which Lord Pentland put at 5<i>d</i>. in the pound, is not 5<i>d</i>. but 2<i>s</i>.; 2<i>s</i>. is ten per cent. of his whole income, and I hardly think that the most confirmed Radical speaking to any audience would say that a man who out of &#x00A3;5,000 a year is charged 6<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in the pound to the public revenue is paying an unduly small proportion of his share to the burden. It amounts to &#x00A3;1,580 a year out of &#x00A3;5,000.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03647">My Lords, I am not pleading for individuals. I recognise as much as any man in this House that the rich can pay in proportion more than the poor. I am not thinking of those men who have &#x00A3;10,000 a year, and if they are reduced &#x00A3;10,000 a year will still have an ample margin left for luxuries. But if you take a man with a family place and who has a nominal &#x00A3;5,000 a year and who out of that pays &#x00A3;1,500 or &#x00A3;1,600 a year in taxation, that is very hard upon him, and a very large amount of what remains to him is mortgaged already for necessary employment. I will make three deductions in this connection. The first is that the majority of men are not prudent enough to tax themselves so highly, and will therefore pay these charges out of capital and not out of income. I submit that the nation has no more right to defray its annual expenditure out of capital than has a private individual. The second deduction which I draw is this. We have been told that land is not affected by this, but in my opinion it is absolutely impossible to avoid
<col>1162</col>
an increase of unemployment in agricultural districts and a further driving of people into the towns if you too unduly tax agriculturists. This is not a question, such as the Irish Land Act, of a transfer of the profit from the landlord to the tenant, in which case the money remains with the land, perhaps more so, but it is an absolute diversion of money from the land to national service. The third point is one which was made by Lord Milner in language I cannot hope to equal, and with regard to which I entirely agree with him&#x2014;that if you press this system of Death Duties too far you arrive at a point at which the fines are so heavy that capital cannot recover between fine and fine, and it then becomes a wasteful and ruinous method of raising revenue. I cannot help feeling that if we impose such duties as these we are running down the slope of national impoverishment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03648">I was struck with one omission in the noble Viscount's speech. He did not speak with that strength with which so many noble Lords on his side of the House have spoken against the alternative which has been put forward from this side, but I know he is an ardent Free Trader. The other day the noble Viscount published a most interesting paper from the India Office showing the progress of India in the course of the last thirty or forty years, and one subject which was specially noted for the pleasing consumption of British readers was that the Jive per cent. general tax levied on imports into India, so far from in any way reducing imports, had in the last few years, largely in the period of the noble Viscount, risen from three millions to five millions, and had actually restored the equilibrium of the Indian Budget. Many people have asked us, and we have been asked in the course of this debate: "What is your alternative? Dare you tell the people that you propose to put this taxation on them rather than levy it as we propose?" My Lords, there is extreme and fearful poverty in this country. We have been told of the terrible effects and the misery which our industrial system creates. Will that be relieved by this Budget? Does the noble Viscount think, after Lord Rothschild's speech, that money will come forward more freely for industrial enterprise? Will he tell us that industrial enterprise has been in any way crippled in India by the duty to which I have alluded? He certainly will not tell us that he is not dealing there with a population to whom not merely
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0588"/>
<col>1163</col>
pence but even farthings in the purchase of commodities are an object, and yet has he not seen a satisfactory advance all along the line in India under the very system of duties, which, without the slightest desire of fostering industries which cannot protect themselves, it is desired to attempt in this country?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03649">My Lords, the position in which we are placed is, indeed, a difficult one. We believe that the Budget as it stands is as short-sighted as it is inequitable. We believe that instead of decreasing unemployment and improving the lot of the poor, it will greatly imperil the continued employment of the poor. We believe that the Government have not shifted the burden on to the right shoulders. We know that if you had, instead of going out of your way to select particular interests which are not the most flourishing ones for your taxation, looked merely to where there was the largest margin, you would have framed your Budget differently. Yet we are asked from the Woolsack to forego our rights, and we are advised from the Cross Benches to defer the exercise of them to some greater national emergency. My Lords, I think that the assumption that this struggle has not been provoked by the Government but has been provoked by this House is a most extraordinary one. If you look merely to the taxation which has been given up; if you look to the wanton abandonment of the export coal duty which produced &#x00A3;2,500,000, an export which continued to rise despite the duty, although it was an article which we might desire to see sent not too largely abroad; if you look at the &#x00A3;1,500,000 thrown away last year upon tea, which I believe has not in the slightest degree affected the price of tea to the poorer people; if you think also of the &#x00A3;3,000,000 thrown away upon sugar, we cannot make much of the argument of the Government when they come here <i>in forma pauperis</i> and say, "It is you who refuse to pay your share." As the noble Viscount said, your Lordships, however unjustly, will be accused of having championed the cause of the rich against the poor. But you have not only to consider that charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03650">I submit that nothing can warrant the tacking on to the Budget proposals which have been already rejected by your Lordships' House, and if your Lordships to-day give up the particular privilege which you
<col>1164</col>
possess in that respect you can never resume it, and may have to face for generations to come Budgeting under similar conditions. That, I think, makes it quite clear that the quarrel has not been made here. If we take Lord Rosebery's view&#x2014;and I much regret that circumstances have made him form so strong an opinion as not to be here when the Division bell rings&#x2014;the Bill is a revolutionary one. The noble Viscount also talked of revolution. My Lords, although we do not desire to minimise, we still less desire to magnify, the issue, that is not language which is used on this side of the House. We think that this crisis is not as great as the crisis of 1831 when noble Lords did believe that they were on the brink of revolution. The leading speakers in that debate made it perfectly clear as to what they felt on the issue before them. Lord Brougham said on that occasion&#x2014;
<quote>" Their Lordships were standing on the brink of the most momentous decision that ever human assembly came to at any period of the world,"</quote>
and Lord Eldon, not to be outdone, gave it as his opinion that&#x2014;
<quote>" With this Reform Bill in operation the monarchy cannot exist, and it is totally incompatible with the existence of the British Constitution."</quote>
With that issue before them, and with the knowledge that this House must be imperilled for ever by the exercise of their privilege and by the vote which they intended to give, the Statesmen of 1831 considered it to be their duty to their country to vote as they did, and that their duty was greater than their interest in this House. Accepting as we do what the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, said, that this Budget is an omen of evil for the future, creates great financial confusion in the present, and is at variance with all preconceived financial theories of the past, I wonder whether the noble Viscount, who has written so much and so warmly in favour of strength of conviction&#x2014;I could quote many passages, but I will spare him&#x2014;indicating that he thinks very little of the man who has not zeal and faith and confidence but is content with a trivial compromise, would extend to us his respect if we acted upon the advice of Lord Rosebery. I do not believe that the youngest and least experienced of the members of your Lordships' House whom Lord Rosebery almost advised to absent themselves from this Division, could have given your Lordships advice that less tended to the honour and dignity and prestige of the House than the advice which the noble Earl
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0589"/>
<col>1165</col>
gave us, that we should state our views and convictions but that we should not carry them into effect in the Division Lobby.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03651">What would be the opinion of the country if all these gloomy predictions which we have unfortunately had to make are realised, and if, as those who guide us in the City tell us will be the case, capital is diverted from the country; if the country finds that unemployment, which is now so rife, has largely increased; if the people themselves in two or three years time rebel and demand a remedy which it may then take years to apply. Do you not think if your Lordships' House were then to come forward and say "That has been our opinion about it all along," that the country might reply to us, as Dr. Johnson did to Lord Chesterfield&#x2014;
<quote>" My Lord, yon are one who looks with unconcern on the man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground you cumber him with your help."</quote>
We are told that the rejection of this Bill would be an unprecedented act. But I think there is one action which would be more unprecedented, and that is that the most independent assembly in the world should acquiesce in the passage of a Bill for which not one member away from the Government Benches, whether he intends to vote or to abstain from voting, is ready to take one jot or tittle of responsibility, and the results of which are, as I venture to think, clearly foreseen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03652"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I am unable, I regret, to afford support to the Amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Lansdowne, I hope you will not grudge me an opportunity of very briefly stating to you the reasons which have caused me to come to the conclusion that such support should be withheld. I am happy to be able to use the word "briefly," because from the nature of the position that I suggest should be taken by this House I am precluded from dealing with more than one point that has been raised in the course of the debate. My proposition is that it is beyond the constitutional competency of this House to reject this Bill. I do not shrink from that position. It is the result, perhaps, of political training in old Whig principles; but clearly and distinctly I submit the proposition and stand by the view that we have no competency to reject this Budget.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, if you will allow me, I will elaborate that proposition. My noble friend on the Woolsack stated that in
<col>1166</col>
determining the question of competency we were not controlled by what was the law affecting the subject, but that we were controlled by the constitutional power that exists within this House. I venture to say respectfully that, notwithstanding the opinions expressed in the House against that view, the Chancellor's proposition is a sound one. My noble friend Lord Halsbury, replying to the Lord Chancellor, said&#x2014;
<quote>" What is the part of the Constitution that is infringed by the rejection of this Bill? "</quote>
I will tell my noble friend. It is exactly and precisely that portion of the Constitution which controls the relations between the two Houses of Parliament. The law does not control those relations. How could it? Those relations have sprung up during centuries, and the Constitution is founded, happily for us, on a solid basis. It has been founded on precedent, usage, practice, and acquiescence, and all these characteristics are in favour of the proposition that the House of Lords in its relation to finance measures, and in relation to the House of Commons, is controlled by precedent, practice, usage, and acquiescence. If time were given to me I think I could demonstrate to your Lordships that every one of these ingredients comes into play to prevent your Lordships from taking the course which it is now suggested you should take.<lb/>
I have heard the phrase used by many of your Lordships&#x2014;it has certainly been used in the Lobby&#x2014;" You admit that it is legal, and the law is good enough for me; if it is legal, that is satisfactory." My noble friend Lord Midleton spoke just now of our privilege and of our legal rights as if that determined the question. As I said just now, legal considerations do not control the relations of the two Houses. I know I cannot expect you to accept propositions barely made by me, but there is one authority on the difference between what is law and what is constitutional custom to which I would, with great confidence, refer your Lordships. In the year 1856 the Government of the day conferred a life peerage on Sir James Parke, afterwards Lord Wensleydale. The Conservative members of this House objected to that life Peerage, and it was objected to by probably the most distinguished Conservative lawyers who have sat in this House. Lord Lyndhurst led the opposition to it. What was Lord
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0590"/>
<col>1167</col>
Lyndhurst's view, concurred in by Lord St. Leonards and Lord Campbell? Lord Lyndhurst said&#x2014;
<quote>" I hear it repeated this is part of the prerogative of the Crown and that the Crown may legally appoint a Peer for life. Assuming that to be the case, it does not follow that every exercise of such a prerogative is consistent with the principles of the Constitution. The Sovereign may, if he thinks proper, create by his prerogative a hundred Peers with descendible qualities in the course of a day. That would be consistent with the prerogative and strictly legal; but everybody must feel and everybody must know that such an exercise of the undoubted prerogative of the Crown would be a flagrant violation of the principles of the Constitution. In the same manner the Sovereign might place the Great Seal in the hands of a layman wholly unacquainted with the laws of the country. Other cases might be adduced, but these already cited are sufficient to establish the principle I maintain. Every person who has studied the Constitution of this country and who is at all conversant with the principles on which it is founded must be aware that one of its principles is long continued usage."</quote>
I could give your Lordships other authorities. As I mentioned, Lord St. Leonards and Lord Campbell agreed with Lord Lyndhurst that in dealing with the prerogative of the Crown at least you do not look to law, you look to usage, and if my noble friend Lord Halsbury asks me "Where is your constitutional declaration?" I answer that I have given it to him&#x2014;that is the relations of Parliament following usage and precedent which show us the Constitution with which we have to deal. I also reply to my noble friend who says law alone should control our action, and ask him, if you are dealing with a legal right, where is the record of your legal right? You say that you have the declarations of great men in favour of it. Where is the proposition that can be found to support the idea that only law should guide us? My Lords, do let me remind you that it is not only in regard to the relations of the Houses of Parliament that this constitutional power comes in as distinguished from law. Why is it you cannot vote at elections? There is, as far as I know, no law to prevent you. It is because the Constitution prevents you, and it would not be enough for you to say, "I have a legal right to vote, and that is enough for me." The Judges of the land have told you that you have not, because the Constitution prevents you. You will not be allowed when this conflict takes place to enter into it; you will not be allowed to record your votes and you will not be allowed to go to an election meeting because long habit and long usage prevent you, not
<col>1168</col>
in consequence of any legal disability but entirely in consequence of constitutional disability. There may be some who will say that similar considerations have affected the judicial decision that women have as certainly as your Lordships no right to vote.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, in referring to what has occurred in the past, I will be very brief, although I could occupy hours in giving you authoritative declarations of your inability to intervene in this controversy. This conflict really began early in the fifteenth century, but I will skip a good many events and read to you an early declaration of this House of what its rights were in the year 1640. In that year the House of Lords, for some reason, was very desirous that the Commons should take Supply first. The Lords sent this communication to the Commons&#x2014;
<quote>" Under all the circumstances, although my Lords would not meddle with subsidy, which belong properly and entirely to you "&#x2014;</quote>
this is the solemn admission of this House to the House of Commons&#x2014;
<quote>" no, not to give you advice thereon&#x2014;they have utterly declined it&#x2014;yet being members with you of one body they have declared by vote that they hold it most necessary that Supply should have precedence over every other matter whatsoever."</quote>
That was the view of this House at that time. But that sturdy old Republican, Pym, gave a very firm answer. He said&#x2014;
<quote>" Your Lordships have been pleased to advise that this matter of Supply naturally belongs to the House of Commons. Your Lordships say you would not meddle with it, no, not so much as to give advice, yet if you have voted this Resolution you have meddled with it, and the House of Commons takes that to be a breach of privilege."</quote>
I pass over the great revolution of 1688, which, as Lord John Russell said, gave the liberty which was the real foundation of our great Constitution, and come to the solemn declaration of Chatham that it was the House of Commons alone in which was vested the power of taxation. He said "taxation is no part of the legislative or governing power. The taxes are a voluntary gift and grant of the Commons alone," and then Lord Chatham eloquently gave his reasons for repudiating any power in this House to deal with Supply Bills. Then, my Lords, the words of Edmund Burke have been quoted this evening, and the principles contained in them ring through the pages of our history.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03653">There is another example that I should like to give because I think it
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0591"/>
<col>1169</col>
follows what has been done in earlier times, and because the weight of its authority may affect noble Lords on this side of the House. In 1786 Mr. Pitt introduced a Bill to apportion &#x00A3;250,000 a year to the redemption of the National Debt as a kind of Sinking Fund. When the Bill came to this House the Lords thought they would interfere with the proposed legislation, but they had no information. Of course this House never has any information on the question of subsidy. They sent a message to the Commons asking for information. Mr. Pitt received the message, and although he was not, I think, likely to assume anything against the House of Lords&#x2014;he must have had many grateful friends within it&#x2014;he indignantly refused to give this House the slightest information. He said it was for the House of Commons to deal with the question of appropriation of taxes, and he moved a Resolution in terms declaring that the House of Lords should have no information on such a subject. I hope your Lordships will acquit Mr. Pitt of doing anything at all unconstitutional, and I am sure he was not a man who would be likely to pander to public opinion. Mr. Pitt was Chancellor of the Exchequer at that time and knew his position well; he represented the Conservative Party in the State, and he gave that opinion as a man who well knew what he was doing. Certainly he was one who revered the Constitution.<lb/>
I will pause for a moment to ask you to consider what is the matter we are dealing with. The words "Money Bill" are sometimes used, I think, rather inconsiderately. Lord Palmerston in 1860 apparently applied them to all Bills in which taxation was imposed. That is not the kind of Bill we are dealing with. We are dealing with the Budget Bill which grants Supply for the service of the State during the year. Your Lordships will bear in mind that that grant is given in response to an appeal from the Crown, not to us. "Gentlemen of the House of Commons, I ask you to give me aid and Supply." It is to them and to them alone the request is made. There is no appeal whatever made to the House of Lords. Then at the end of the session when the Prorogation takes place thanks have to be given to someone, and although your Lordships have gone through the form of assenting to the Finance Bill no thanks are ever given to us. Again it is&#x2014;
<quote>" Gentlemen of the House of Commons, I have to thank you for the generous Supply you have given to me."</quote>
<col>1170</col>
There is nothing within the Constitution showing that thanks ought to be given to the House of Lords for that Supply. My Lords, the matter is of so much delicacy that I purposely avoid attempting to forecast how the paragraph of thanks will express at the end of the session the gratitude of the Crown.<lb/>
Will your Lordships allow me to mention one other fact which may be known to you? The practice is in this House that whenever a Bill is finally read a third time in either House it passes into the custody of the Clerk of Parliaments, it is retained in his hands until the Sovereign, by himself or by Commission, gives assent to it. But in respect of two Bills&#x2014;the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill&#x2014;the Commons to the knowledge of this House have asserted their privilege and right to deal with such Billsalone. The other House never will trust our officer with those two Bills, and the moment either of them is read a third time in this House someone on behalf of the Commons claims it back, and the Speaker keeps it in his custody or in that of the Chief Clerk. When the Speaker comes to the bar of this House to hear the Royal Assent he intimates to our officer, the Clerk of the Parliaments, that he has something to give him, and he gives him this Bill. That is for the momentary purpose of the Royal Assent being given to it. My Lords, we have admitted that custom to be a correct one, and how can it be said that we are upon an equality with the other House in relation to those two Bills when our own officer will not be entrusted with them because they are Commons Bills and not House of Lords Bills? You may say it is not a very important matter to have charge of these two pieces of paper which constitute Bills, but it is a symbol of the control which the Commons have over those Bills. That is a point I would ask you not to pass by too lightly until you can find some good reason for this old custom.<lb/>
I am not troubling your Lordships by quoting the numerous declarations upon the constitutional position made by distinguished men; but there is one authority I must quote. I was taught in my earliest political life to regard with the greatest respect as a Whig Statesman Lord John Russell than whom I think it will be admitted there is no one who had great or knowledge of the Constitution and its origin, and greater knowledge of those ingredients of political
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0592"/>
<col>1171</col>
life that constitute the freedom of the people. Let me refer to what he said in connection with what is called the precedent of 1860. I think there was something in the mind of several of your Lordships who have spoken that the Paper Duties Bill was a precedent in favour of this Amendment, but when you have looked at it I think you will find that it is destructive of any such contention. In the course of the debate which arose upon the Lords throwing out that Bill&#x2014;not a Budget Bill, not a Supply granted by the Commons in reply to the demand of the Crown, but simply one isolated measure&#x2014;Lord Palmerston said that the House of Lords could not deal with the Bill. I prefer, however, to rely upon what Lord John Russell said on that occasion. He said&#x2014;
<quote>" I must say that for 200 years there is no instance of the House of Lords having exercised such a power as that which is exerted in the present instance. I believe that, according to all former practice of the Constitution, the whole question of granting Supplies belongs to the House of Commons."</quote>
Then he quotes the eloquent words of Lord Chatham and proceeds to make the further statement of his objection to what had occurred. He said that if ever this conflict came between the two Houses, one voting one way and one the other, there would be confusion which could never be overcome and which would be deadly in the interests of the State. These were his words&#x2014;
<quote>" It is therefore not only true that with regard to all past time ever since our Constitution was a Constitution we have had the power of regulating, but it is true likewise that if we were to part with the power, and the House of Lords were to be admitted, the consequence must be utter confusion to our finance. The remission or imposition of taxation would be in a perpetual state of uncertainty. Each House would endeavour to take off the tax which was most unpopular, thereby to gain for themselves popular credit and applause."</quote>
It is satisfactory for me to say that I am not now placing before you propositions of my own. This comes from one who I am sure was as great an authority upon the Constitution as ever lived, and one who was incapable of being influenced by Party motives. I would remind your Lordships that when the Bill of 1860 was thrown out, Mr. Gladstone reintroduced its provisions in the Budget Bill of 1861, and being in the Budget Bill the Lords, who had objected to the Paper Duty Bill, passed that Budget Bill, and did not dare to reject it, because it was a subsidy Bill given in return to the application of the Crown.<lb/>
<col>1172</col>
There is only one other quotation I am going to make, and I really make it with regret, but I think it is something that will influence your Lordships. I refer to the words of Mr. Balfour in 1907, and I have never read a more explicit declaration than he then made against this power being exercised. I do not care to dwell upon it too much because there may be some explanation of it. He said&#x2014;
<quote>" We all know that the power of the House of Lords is still further limited by the fact that it cannot touch these Money Bills."</quote>
My right hon. friend then proceeded in very distinct terms to explain why. But, my Lords, I really do not care to dwell very much on such personal statements. I have given your Lordships the opinion and authority of great Statesmen which I hope will convince this House that the view I put forward is correct.<lb/>
There is one other matter to which I wish to call your attention. Long usage has shown the impossibility of your Lordships exercising this power of rejecting a Money Bill. It has never been done. Now, my Lords, you claim the actual Tight to reject this Bill. If this rejection is within your competence it has been for centuries equally within your duty. If Supply Bills were bad they ought to have been rejected according to all the arguments we hear now in support of this Amendment. If it was not only our right, but our duty, as we are told, for the sake of the public, to have rejected such Bills if they were bad, why is it that our duty for centuries has never been fulfilled? Is not the alternative either that such constitutional duty did not exist or that we have neglected to do what we ought to have done in the interest of the State? I am happily relieved from expressing any opinion on the contents of the Bill, but my silence must not be taken as indicating that I am in favour of some of all its provisions. In Committee if I were in the House of Commons I would have supported Amendments, but that is not the question. I say this House is estopped from acting because of insufficient power.<lb/>
What do the House of Commons base their Budget Bills upon? They base them upon Estimates. They estimate what is wanted and they get information as to what is required for the State service from the various public Departments. What power has this House to form any estimate? We can get no estimate, and we should not
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0593"/>
<col>1173</col>
have the slightest idea what to budget for, or whether it was right for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask for sixteen millions or 160 millions. If you were to say to that gentleman of whom so much has been said, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that you have no power to estimate, and ask for information, what answer would you get? The same answer that Pitt gave, that you have nothing to do with Estimates. Now, whilst all this, I think, places us in a position of great difficulty, it is sought to escape from the difficulty by saying that this is an exceptional Budget, and that it is exceptional in the sense that it contains so many different subjects. I should like to know what that means. I think it was my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury who said that it contains so many multifarious subjects. I do not think he expressed himself quite correctly, because many taxes are rightly put in, and that would in one sense be multifariousness. What I think he meant to say was that if a Money Bill contained other matters beyond finance&#x2014;foreign, alien matter&#x2014;that would be a ground for throwing out the Bill. I entirely concur. If you introduce into a Money Bill foreign matter such as, say, the ballot, or if you shot into it an enactment about the deceased wife's sister, of course this House would have a perfect right to take exception to such a Bill.<lb/>
All this introduction of alien matter is represented by one word&#x2014;it is "tacking." If I am asked is there "tacking" in this Bill, I should say there was not; but the question becomes immaterial. If there is "tacking" in this Bill, the duty of this House is complete. It would semi-judicially determine this "tacking," and we should reject the Bill because it is an insult and a fraud upon this House, and rightly say "Take your Bill away." But that question does not arise. You are not rejecting this Bill on the ground of tacking. It is whispered throughout the Lobby that this is not rejection at all. But if you postpone a Bill for three or six months or even until a General Election takes place, it is equally a rejection of the Bill. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, in his Amendment which remits to the electors the decision upon the Bill, does not I am sure for a moment intend to leave to them the decision of whether this Bill contains tacking or not. That could not be, because the electorate has no knowledge of Parliamentary history or Parliamentary practice. It must be a question
<col>1174</col>
for us. I am sure the noble Marquess will agree that what he seeks by his Amendment is to leave to the electorate the policy of this measure, because he cannot give to them the power to determine whether tacking vitiates this Bill. Therefore we come back to the pure simple question&#x2014;because a majority of this House does not like the provisions of this Bill, is it within its competence to reject it?<lb/>
During the struggle that is coming upon us, there will be many students, many readers who will read out aloud to audiences that the balance, and the conclusive balance, of authority is that there is no competency in this House. I can assure the noble Marquess, and he knows, that it is in no spirit of hostility that I quote his words. My noble friend said&#x2014;
<quote>" I would venture to ask, shall we stand better or worse when the struggle comes if we shirk our responsibility now? "</quote>
I ask him to consider, if it be right that this is outside competency and that this is an unconstitutional act, shall we not be very much the worse for taking that unconstitutional step? What a power we are giving to our opponents! We all know the power of any Party rallied together, bound together by a common cause, with all their differences composed because they have got a great overwhelming cause. What will they be saying of us throughout the land in consequence of this action? It is nothing to say, "If it is right to do it, we should do it and never mind the consequences." The first question is to find out whether you have got the power to do right, and if you have not, then wrong will come prominently against this House.<lb/>
Let me repeat that the contest which is coming will be a one-sided contest. In the conflict that is going to take place, none of your Lordships will be able to take a share, not one of your Lordships will be able to defend the course that you have taken, not one of your Lordships will be able to say that you have been acting, in your belief, within the Constitution. You will be at the mercy of your opponents, and at the mercy of men who will not spare you. I do not know how Unionist members of the House of Commons are going to take this decision of your Lordships' House. You are making every one of them ride a race with a good deal of extra weight up. You are making for them hostile audiences. I should like to bear testimony myself on that point. There
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0594"/>
<col>1175</col>
is a certain class of practical sportsmen who are said to make the very best gamekeepers. I can tell you something about agitation against the House of Lords. The House of Lords in 1884 threw out the Franchise Bill. That was, of course, within their power. But the Liberal Party resented the exercise of it, and I was told off in very good company&#x2014;the late John Bright and the late Duke of Devonshire&#x2014;to do what we could in Lancashire. I can assure your Lordships that it is very easy work to howl against this House. The House of Lords was overruling, as we told our audiences, their representatives, overruling the representatives whom they had elected. Then, of course, we told them about 500 or 600 persons being supreme. We did as we liked with our audience. We took every wicket, although some of our bowling was not very strong. This assertion of the exclusive right of the Commons to deal with finance will now be added to the previous attack on your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I, my Lords, am devoted to the principle of a double Chamber, and as I desire to see the fortunes of the Unionist Party supreme, I am appalled at the prospect we wilfully and intentionally are raising against that principle. Such are my convictions. They are those, perhaps, of a Party man in one sense, for I am an old Whig, and I have never forgotten the principles of that old Whiggism which, I believe, represent liberty in this land. I have followed many leaders. I am sorry that, to-night, I am parting somewhat, for this purpose only, from my noble friend Lord Lansdowne. I have no right to speak with any personal knowledge as to what Lord Salisbury would have said if he had been in charge in this crisis. But we have his public statements, and I think that if that most sagacious, most patriotic of men was here to-night he would not give approval to this Amendment. I need scarcely tell your Lordships what Mr. Gladstone would have said. His valedictory words in 1894 told us his views upon the action of this House. I had one other leader whose memory is yet fresh in my mind, a leader whom no man in this country could do other than regard, and who to his dying day retained those old principles of Whiggism which had been the principles of his house. He never would have been, I verily believe, a party to this course. My Lords, I am no deserter. I am no deserter from any principle that I have ever thought ought to guide the
<col>1176</col>
public mind, and I do not believe that even the noble Marquess will regard me as a personal deserter from him to-night.<lb/>
Such being the views I entertain strongly, I have the courage of them, and I now ask myself what is the course that ought to be taken in order to emphasise the opinions I hold. I have surveyed those two roads which my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh so invitingly traced out before us, and I am not disposed to follow them. And, much as I appreciate the fascination of Lord Balfour's society, I shrink from going into the woods with him. As I say, I have the courage of my opinions, and therefore it is that I will not take for myself any path but that of the Constitution, which will lead, I believe, if it is followed, to securing the security and safety of this House, and will increase the power of the Unionist Party in the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03654"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of criticising or discussing any of the details of the Budget. The clauses of the Bill dealing with finance, and those clauses, which are, perhaps, more important, dealing with social matters, have been already so thoroughly and so ably dealt with that no words of mine could add anything. I only wish to make one specific allusion to those clauses of the Bill which will have a peculiar effect upon Ireland. I enter a protest first of all against any additional taxation being placed upon Ireland. I am not going to-night to inflict an Irish speech upon the House, but I think it will be agreed by everybody, certainly by His Majesty's Government, that if the relative capacities of the communities in Great Britain and Ireland be taken into consideration, there can be no doubt that the burden of taxation is far heavier upon Ireland than it is upon Great Britain. But I have no wish to argue that.<lb/>
I have no doubt if that was the question before the House, I should be told that even if that was so, Ireland is getting advantages in so many ways that they will make up for it, and that in any case the same taxation upon the same articles is the only possible system, and the over-taxation, if it exists, must be borne. If I were arguing the case, I should reply to that by reminding your Lordships of what I think is very often forgotten, that when the two countries were placed under one fiscal system it was stipulated for and agreed that Ireland was entitled to abatements and exemptions. No adequate
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0595"/>
<col>1177</col>
abatements or exemptions have been made under the Budget Bill. On the contrary, a sum which I do not think can be estimated at less than &#x00A3;2,000,000 a year has been added to the already over-great burden of taxation which is crippling the Irish people in their most laudable endeavours to recreate industrial life in their country. That huge addition to a weight of taxation already overwhelming would in itself be very cruel. In view of the fact that Ireland is entitled to exemptions and abatements, I think it is unjust even almost to the extent of illegality, and I am sure it is most unwise when you consider the peculiar effect of some of these land clauses upon Ireland. Undeveloped land is taxed, and, as your Lordships know, land that has been developed, used for buildings, trade, manufactures, and so on, and that has relapsed into an undeveloped state, is considered undeveloped, and subject to duties. Well, that may be right enough&#x2014;I do not wish to argue it&#x2014;in the case of Great Britain, where, as a rule, towns and cities are increasing and progressing. But what is the position in Ireland? Ireland, alas&#x0021;is full of cities and towns and villages decayed or decaying. Ireland is covered with closed factories and disused mills, and to say that all this land, which was formerly developed but has decayed owing to the destruction of industries and for various reasons which I need not now specify, has become undeveloped, shall be subject to duty seems to me the most absurd financial proposition that was ever attempted to be placed upon the Statute Book.<lb/>
Will your Lordships consider for a moment the case of purely agricultural land? Agricultural land, of course, is subject to various imposts, stamp duties, and duties on transfer, in fact upon almost every transaction that has to do with land. Death Duties are increased, and also the Income Tax. All those imposts will fall infinitely heavier upon Ireland than upon Great Britain. I must remind your Lordships that 230,000 tenants have purchased their holdings in Ireland and become landowners within the last five or six years; that 73,000 have become landowners under former Land Acts; that there are in fact in Ireland about 300,000 men who when they were tenants would have escaped all these imposts, yet upon whom since they have purchased their holdings and become landowners these imposts will fall. Now, all these men are debtors to the State, and surely it would be prudent and wise to give every possible encouragement
<col>1178</col>
to them to put every ounce of energy and every penny of capital into the development of their property, and so enhance the value of the security of the State. It must be better that loans should be secured on an increasing and not in a wasting security. And how are these men treated? Take only the valuation. The whole of the agricultural land of Ireland will be valued and the market value fixed by an official. It will be very difficult, but no doubt not impossible, to ascertain the market value of land in England, but I maintain it will be absolutely impossible to do so in Ireland. If there was a natural open market value for land, if there was only a normal desire and competition to get land, if agriculture was conducted as a purely business proposition, values and rents, would have adjusted themselves, and there would have been no necessity whatever for the dozens of Land Acts that cumber the Statute Books. But that is not the case in Ireland. You cannot possibly get a market value when in some cases there is no market at all, and no prices to be got, and in other cases and at other times enormous sums are given for tenant rights and for possession for small holdings. So I take it that the purchase price will be assumed to be the fair market value. But the purchase price has to be repaid by annuities, and as the instalments are paid off the value of the land, of course, increases. But the imposts and duties upon it increase, so the practical effect will be that you are penalising the man for paying off his debts. Some of these tenant purchasers may make money and save money, or they may be left money. I know of no better way in which they could invest their money, though it is not at a very high rate of interest, than in paying off their instalments and liquidating the debt, or as much as possible of it, that they owe to the State. That certainly would be a considerable advantage to the State, for it would free money that could be used again for carrying on land purchase in the future. But are these men likely to do that when the mere fact of their doing it, and perhaps paying off the whole of their debt to the State will only render them liable to much heavier imposts in the way of Death Duties and so on?<lb/>
The one thing that ought to be done was to give every encouragement to these small proprietors to develop their holdings and to feel absolutely secure in the validity of their titles to them, and secure in the enjoyment of them subject only to such taxes and such rates as are imposed upon.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0596"/>
<col>1179</col>
other forms of property. I think your Lordships know very well what the real object of these land clauses is. It is to insert the thin end of the wedge of State proprietorship, instead of individual ownership, of land. All these imposts are placed upon these small landowners in Ireland because in the thinly veiled opinion of His Majesty's Government, and in the perfectly openly expressed opinion of the principal supporters of the Government in the country, individual ownership of land is wrong, and ought to be discouraged with a view to its final abolition. It is not much encouragement to the small landowners in Ireland to feel secure in their titles, and to develop their property. I do think it is worth the while of this House to consider this matter seriously, even if your Lordships are not specially concerned with Ireland and with Irish prosperity. Take it only as an example. I hope, and I believe the great majority of your Lordships hope, to see a large increase in the number of small landowners in Great Britain, but of one thing your Lordships may be perfectly sure, that if you ever want to get the people back to the land, the only way in which that can be successfully carried out is under the stimulus and the energising charm of private ownership. If any real attempt is made to largely increase the number of landowners in Great Britain, they will then be in precisely the same condition as the tenant proprietors in Ireland, and I think the example of Ireland will then be found useful to your Lordships.<lb/>
It is no wonder, and it is perfectly true, as my noble and learned friend said, that every man, woman and child in Ireland is hostile to the Budget, and is looking to this House to take better care of their interests than the other House of Parliament has done. For that reason alone, if for no other&#x2014;its disastrous effects upon Ireland&#x2014;I feel myself compelled to enter the strongest possible protest against the Budget. That is the only allusion I propose to make to any detail whatever of the Budget. My objections are quite of a general character. In spite of what fell from the lips of the noble Viscount opposite, I object to the Budget because it contains proposals, or at any rate the very well-developed and fruitful germs of proposals, for destroying and reconstructing the whole economic and social fabric of the community. It introduces a completely novel principle of taxation, and an entirely new departure in our national finance. This social
<col>1180</col>
revolution and these new principles have never been submitted to the electorate. That is the solid basis of my objection, and even if the proposals in the Budget did not appear to me objectionable, I should very much doubt whether those proposals ought to be passed into law before the people have had an opportunity of expressing their opinion about them. I can perfectly well understand the attitude of a man who will say that these proposals may not be bad and may be even beneficial; but they are so utterly novel and unprecedented that they ought not to be put on the Statute Book until the people have expressed their opinion about them. I cannot understand the attitude of those noble Lords whose speeches I have listened to, as we all have, with the greatest attention, who, while considering the Budget proposals to be absolutely pernicious, are yet quite content to say that they should be enacted without the people having an opportunity of saying whether they liked them or not.<lb/>
I do not wish to go into the constitutional question, or the right of the House to reject this Bill. I think that was disposed of by my noble friend Lord Salisbury. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, if I remember aright, said that no doubt if the House accepted the Amendment it would be within its rights; it would be legal, but that in his opinion it would not be constitutional. I think that was the view taken by the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down, but I admit that, although I was sitting behind him, he seemed to me to be delivering rather a personal lecture to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition than addressing the House generally, and I could not very well catch what he said. But, at any rate, it is legal. We have a right to do it, and what are we to understand by unconstitutional? What I understand by unconstitutional is that such action as is proposed would not be in accordance with convention, usage, and custom. I quite agree with that; but the power and the right do not lapse from disuse; and if the power has not been used by this House, why has it not been so used? Because the necessity for it has not arisen. If the power of this House has been seldom used, it is because the power of the Government with a majority in the other House has been so seldom abused.<lb/>
The question, therefore, to me narrows itself down into this: Are we justified
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0597"/>
<col>1181</col>
in using our rights and our powers on the present occasion? I know that the fact that the Budget contains multifarious matters has been denied by none more forcibly than the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, and I think he instanced the valuation clauses as an evidence, and said that they were absolutely necessary for the collection of taxes. I did not think the example was altogether a very happy one, because, as your Lordships know, the amount of taxes raised are so insignificant as to be a negligible quantity. What the Government propose to do is to set up a vast and complicated machine at huge expense to collect an utterly insignificant tax, not in the least necessary, and not really of any value in meeting the financial requirements of the year. You are not setting up machinery to collect the necessary taxes. You are setting up practically a nominal tax in order to justify the creation of machinery which is not for use now, but which is to be used for we do not know what at some future time, we do not know when. That seems to me an absolutely new departure from precedent.<lb/>
The Bill contains many other novelties. It proposes, as far as I know, for the first time to meet current expenditure out of capital. It adjusts taxation, not with reference to the capacity of wealth or income to bear taxation, but with reference to the opinion of the Government as to the character and the source of the wealth and income. That appears to me to be the most inquisitorial, arbitrary, and utterly un-English proposal that has ever been put before the country. But it is not necessary to pursue that. It must be admitted, and will be admitted by every one, that legislation of any kind attacking any of our institutions, harassing and affecting any trade or industry, can be introduced in the guise of a Money Bill, and if this House is on that account unable to deal with it, then this House is practically reduced to a condition of impotency. We have had some threats directed against the House if it accepts this Amendment. We have had admonitions, and a great deal of advice showered upon us. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack the other day asked "Why this impatience? Why not accept the Finance Bill and wait just a couple of years until the term of Parliament has expired, and then if the people do not like the Bill you can repeal all its provisions." In the first place, if the principles of this Bill are once accepted,
<col>1182</col>
if they once find foothold on the Statute Book, they cannot be revoked. If this House does not object and make its stand now, it will never have an opportunity again of making that stand, however much those principles may be developed in the future.<lb/>
I might, perhaps, be allowed to remind the noble and learned Lord that according to the views of the Party of which he is so bright an ornament, the Government have been in office as long as or longer than they have a right to be and expect to retain the confidence of the country. Short Parliaments was one of the principal planks in the famous Newcastle Programme. Three-year Parliaments, or, at the utmost, four-year Parliaments have been advocated on thousands of Radical platforms. What, then, is the situation? The people of the country have, according to the views of the Radical Party and of the Government, presumably, lost confidence in the Government by this time. That is their view; I do not say it is right or wrong. According to their publicly-expressed opinion, the Government have lost touch with the people. If their theories are correct, their majority in the House of Commons no longer represents the people, and yet, with the sanction and authority of that majority, they want to force upon the Statute Book a social and financial policy of which the people never had an inkling at the last General Election, which has never been before them, and upon which, as a consequence, they have never been able to pronounce any opinion. I cannot imagine a clearer case in which it is the simple, plain duty of a Second Chamber to intervene. If under these circumstances this House does not make a stand for the right of the electors to be consulted, and does not grant a stay of execution in this matter, I say it will never again be able to maintain its rights as a Second Chamber. It will simply become a cipher in the Constitution. It has no option in the matter except to act or abdicate.<lb/>
I find it difficult to understand why under those circumstances the Government seem so reluctant to take the fatal plunge of consulting the electors. I cannot understand why they so greatly resent the gentle compulsion towards that fatal plunge which the acceptance of the Amendment will give them. I can only suppose that it is because they are reluctant to fight a General Election on their Budget,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0598"/>
<col>1183</col>
or against Tariff Reform, and they are anxious to cover up their policy by an agitation against this House. Of course I shall be told, as we have been told this evening, that the real objection that the Government have is that it is an outrageous thing for this House to interfere with a Finance Bill; that it would enable this House, if we once did so, to precipitate a General Election every year; that it would deprive the Commons of their undoubted rights and privileges over finance and over dissolutions, and that it would dislocate the whole machinery of the State. Well, of course, it would. I quite agree with that; but if the House of Commons were to adopt this new principle of wrapping up any kind of legislation they please in a Finance Bill, and say that this House cannot therefore touch it, would not that have precisely the same effect? Would not that absolutely smash up the whole Constitution and substitute a single Chamber, and a single Chamber of the very worst description, because there would be nominally a double Chamber system, but the Second Chamber would be absolutely impotent and a mere cipher?<lb/>
I do not think any of your Lordships would seriously argue that this House is likely to desire to upset the balance of the Constitution, or to interfere in any way with the Tights of the Commons over finance, or over dissolutions of Parliament. The whole history of the House is opposed to such an absurd doctrine as that. It is safe to say and every Member of this House will agree that it is safe to say that this House will never interfere with a Finance Bill, provided it is a Finance Bill and nothing more; but when a Finance Bill of this character is brought up, the case is very different. When we are asked to adduce instances of this House interfering with Finance Bills, instances could be adduced, but I think it is quite sufficient, and a fair retort, to ask for specific instances when any Finance Bill the least resembling the Bill before the House has ever been brought before this House and accepted. This Bill contains many Bills which have been considered and rejected by this House. It is founded on social principles which have not been accepted by the people. It introduces novel principles of finance which the electors have never dreamed of. It involves a social and financial revolution. The revolution maybe beneficent or otherwise;
<col>1184</col>
the principles and proposals may be wise or foolish, that is a matter for argument; but in any case no Government has any right to try and smuggle these principles and proposals on to the Statute Book under the cloak of a Money Bill. We have been told that we are fighting in a very bad position, that our position is strategically weak. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery, said it was not a suitable battlefield. I quite agree with all that. I think our position is weak. I think His Majesty's Government have been very clever. They have manoeuvred this House into a very difficult position. But granting all that, what option have we? We cannot choose another battlefield. We cannot occupy another position. If we make any protest at all against the principles of this Bill, it must be made now. We cannot possibly have another opportunity. There is no question of convenience or tactics or positions. The sole question before the House is its duty to the people of this country. I do not know what the consequences will be Very direful consequences have been prophesied. In a sense I do not care what the consequences may be. In a sense, of course, I do care, because a great constitutional struggle ought to be avoided at almost any cost, but there is a price that is too dear to pay for a mere temporary peace. But I do not care in the sense that I hold that this House ought to do its duty whatever the consequences to it may be.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, who speaks with such weight and authority, seemed to anticipate very terrible consequences. I seemed to recognise all through the noble Earl's speech, and some other speeches, a rooted distrust of the democracy. I do not share that distrust. I have no doubt that the issues will be confused at the General Election, perhaps purposely confused, but I have that confidence in the intelligence and in the sense of fair play and justice of the electors that I believe they will see, if a constitutional crisis has arisen, it has arisen, not of necessity by any action of this House, but because it is the desire of His Majesty's Government to place before the people at the election something more palatable than their Budget or their financial policy. Whatever the opinion of the electors may be about the Budget, whether they approve or disapprove of it, or whether they approve or disapprove of the action of
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0599"/>
<col>1185</col>
this House, if this House stands up now for the rights of the people to be consulted, and does its duty, I am perfectly certain that this House will retain the respect of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03655"><member>LORD SWAYTHLING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not intend to speak in this Debate because I hardly thought that this was the place to enter into financial details. As to the principle of the Amendment, I am quite content to leave that question in abler hands, but I wish to record that I support the Budget because I consider it the best and the safest mode of raising the money which we so unfortunately require. I desire to say a few words with regard to Tariff Reform, and also as to the financial position. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition gave us Tariff Reform as the alternative to the Budget, and he pointed out that our rivals on the Continent raise high tariff walls against us, but I think there are some noble Lords who do not realise that foreign trade is simply barter. We do not pay for our imports in gold. If we were to attempt to do so, we should find that our small stock of gold at the Bank of England, thirty or forty millions, would disappear in a few weeks. What we must do is to pay our exports against the imports, and if you hamper that trade and impose upon the imports a protective duty, you lessen also the exports and reduce the possibilities of employment. I believe that the French Government, when there is a bad harvest, suspend altogether or reduce the import duty on wheat, with the object of inducing other countries to send wheat to them. Does that not prove that the consumer pays? Germany has protective duties, but Germany never enjoyed the blessings of Free Trade, and they cannot forego the large revenue they derive from taxing their own subjects by these protective duties. And is the condition of their working men as good as ours? I think from all my experience, and from what I have heard, it is very much worse, and we all know that poverty either starts or increases Socialism.<lb/>
I now turn to finance. I have had sixty-one years' experience of finance in the City. I do not think I ever missed criticising a Budget brought forward in the House of Commons, but I had thought that this House would be a haven of rest without financial cares or troubles. Unfortunately, I fear that we are going to have a great struggle over financial control.
<col>1186</col>
During those sixty-one years of financial life I have gone through several crises which used to occur pretty regularly once every ten or eleven years, but it speaks well for the good sense and the intelligence of the City of London that now for a long period they have not felt that distrust which develops into panic. There is now some hesitation on account of the transition stage that may be brought about through the rejection of this Budget, but all in the City hope that some prompt measures will be taken to provide for the continuation of taxation. I noted&#x2014;and I am sorry that they are not now in their places&#x2014;that those noble Lords whom I may call the City Lords took a very pessimistic view of the financial position, and of our credit. They said that our capital had gone abroad in large quantities, and that our credit was affected by this Budget.<lb/>
May I respectfully submit the other side of that question? During the six months from the end of March to the end of September the Bank Rate was two and a-half per cent., and the discount outside in the market was on several occasions as low as one and a-quarter. The enormous amount of deposits at our joint stock banks, estimated at &#x00A3;900,000,000, only yielded one. per cent., and it is no wonder that a large amount of our capital sought the foreign markets in order to get a better interest. I want to know in what form our capital has gone out of this country. Is it in cash or in shiploads of bonds? They still remain the property of the British owner, and they can be brought back in a very short time if they become more useful here than elsewhere. A day or two from the Continent, and a week from New York would suffice to bring them back. The Bank Rate of interest has increased from two and a-half for discount and three per cent. for advances to five per cent. for discount and five and a-half per cent. for advances. Consequently money, which, like water, runs in favourable channels, is coming over in larger sums. If cash or securities are sent over to evade the Income Tax or Super Tax, remedies could be provided to stop that practice. It is useless for me to go into those remedies now, the time not having arrived, but our credit, I may tell your Lordships, is still the best in the world. As an evidence, the portfolios of foreign bankers are full of English bills. To give you one startling instance, the Bank of France&#x2014;the State bank&#x2014;has been accumulating English bills
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0600"/>
<col>1187</col>
for the last six months; it has already got over a million sterling in these bills, while their increase is about a quarter of a million every week. Our Consols yield barely three per cent., if you take the extra tax. In France they have no tax on the Rentes. Our Consols stand at eighty-two and three-quarters, which is about fourteen or fifteen per cent. higher than German stocks. In fact, it is the highest-priced stock in the world, with the exception of that of the United States, who issue bonds at a low rate of interest as a basis for the circulation of bank-notes to their face value. There is even an increase in the returns from the Clearing House. Where, therefore, is this great depression?<lb/>
The noble Viscount opposite talked about Irish Land stock, and said that it had decreased in value some three or four per cent. Well, no wonder the price keeps down if the general public, and the bankers especially, know that further large issues of that stock will take place. It is well known that when you issue every now and again large sums of a certain security you must lower the price. I think it was one noble Lord opposite who asked, "How is it our stock goes down, and Japanese stock goes up?" There is a very good reason for that. Japan pays five per cent., and what is more, the Japanese Government declare that they will issue no more stock in the near future, and they are paying off debt rather rapidly. There are always many complicated questions arising with regard to the prices of every stock, and you must not take the bare quotation as the only criterion. It is a great advantage to this country to send money abroad. We try to realise the Biblical quotation, "Thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow." Unfortunately, we cannot resist borrowing money from abroad, but I would appeal to noble Lords to consider one point with regard to the Budget, and that is to put the sanctity of the poor man's loaf far above any question of taxation of land or the taxation of liquor.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03657"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government appear to think that the House of Commons alone should be the judge of the proper time for a Dissolution, and that neither the people nor anyone else should have a word to say in the matter.
<col>1188</col>
The Royal prerogative, too, is now claimed as an appanage of the Prime Minister&#x2014;that is, by the majority of the House of Commons under another name. Some other authority, not necessarily the House of Lords, should have the right to dissolve the House of Commons. No Chamber in any other country has powers so unchecked. None of the authors of written Constitutions ever dreamt of giving such powers to a single Chamber. Some form of referendum might meet this if either House had power to submit points in dispute to a referendum, on giving three months notice, during which time an agreement might be come to between the two Houses. The people would have time to think it over, and contested legislation would only be delayed three months, if it was in accordance with the views of the electorate.<lb/>
The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India I understood to say was opposed to a referendum on the ground that it reduced the responsibility of Statesmen. But I think it would increase their caution. I do not myself believe that this Budget would ever have seen the light if those who brought it forward knew that it would eventually be referred to a referendum. It was because they thought the House of Lords so weak that they attempted to pass the Bill and override this House. Whatever this House does, it should not surrender any of its rights to the House of Commons. That body is far too powerful already, but I think that it might be wise for the Lords to hand over a part of their power to some institution specially created to act as a check to the House of Commons, whenever it appears to be misrepresenting the people, or the Lords might be strengthened by making it to some extent an elected body. I say that the present House of Commons misrepresents the people. Is there a man in either House who believes that when this Bill is rejected it will ever come back to us in its present form with the cry of "The Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill" as was the case with the Reform Bill of 1832? No! Your Irish allies will take care of that. Lord Wear-dale has made the point that for 200 years the Lords have never rejected a Budget. But until now the Commons have never sent up a revolutionary wild-cat Budget, and I hope that another 200 years will elapse before a Second Chamber finds itself obliged to appeal to the people on a finance question.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0601"/>
<col>1189</col>
I shall touch for a moment on the naval finance of the Government. It has been decided that four more Dreadnoughts are to be built, but not one penny has yet been voted for them, Now ready-money payments, whether in public or in private life, are the essence of economy; they are the origin of the co-operative societies and large establishments on ready money principles that are now so flourishing in all parts of the country. If you do not pay ready money it will cost you more, and this is true, whether you are buying tea for private use or ironclads for the public service. The people of this country are, however, so immersed in their own business or in their amusements that they can only think of one public matter at a time. When they had obtained what appeared to them to be a promise of eight Dreadnoughts, their agitation calmed down. They quite forgot that there was also a shortage of sea-going destroyers of the more modern types, and that in the Russo-Japanese war, which began on the 8th of February, no battle of fleets in the open sea took place until the 10th August. During the intervening six months the flotillas and lighter vessels were constantly engaged. Several battleships and large cruisers on both sides were destroyed by mines and torpedoes, before a pitched battle took place between the main fleets.<lb/>
Then, again, by not building continuously the Government have greatly increased the cost of the vessels that they will have to construct, by giving intermittent instead of permanent employment. The hungry unemployed for one year will be overtime workers at high wages in the next, which I submit is bad finance and very hard on the workmen. Altogether their naval finance has been unbusinesslike and uneconomical. For this, Mr. Lloyd-George and Mr. Winston Churchill are, I believe, chiefly responsible. Mr. Winston Churchill should take warning from the fate of his father. All went well with him until he attempted to make serious reductions in the Naval Estimates when Chancellor of the Exchequer; then he fell like a sky-rocket to rise no more. During the last two years our Estimates for new construction have been about the same as those of Germany, and we have, in consequence, a great deal of lee-way to make up. Our Estimates for new construction and armaments for 1910&#x2013;1911 are &#x00A3;10,256,000, and those of Germany are &#x00A3;10,751,000 when calculated on a similar basis.<lb/>
<col>1190</col>
If we wish to keep the command of the sea so as to be able to feed our population with any degree of certainty we ought to spend twice as much as Germany in naval construction. Germany gets as good value for what she spends on shipbuilding as we do ourselves. If a Dissolution had been postponed for two years we should have had Lloyd-George Naval Budgets for two years longer. If he and his colleagues are returned to power we shall have Lloyd-George Naval Budgets for seven years longer. If that happened, then at the end of that time a great deal more than the House of Lords will have ceased to exist. Great Britain as we now know it will have passed away, and the inhabitants of these islands will have learnt to submit to the dictation of foreign Powers under pain of starvation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03658"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to approach the subject from the point of view of a Gladstonian Liberal. Gladstonian Liberals are now called moderate Liberals. They were not always considered moderate Liberals during Mr. Gladstone's life. We are in favour of the maintenance of Free Trade and believe (hat direct taxation ensures that, rather than the increase of indirect taxation. We wish to maintain the Sinking Fund and see the gradual redemption of the National Debt. We do not object to taxation on unearned increment, believing that ultimately the tax on urban land will, in most cases, fall on the occupier of the buildings after the land has been developed. That is a question of the incidence of taxation, and the incidence of taxation is of all the problems of political economy perhaps the most intricate. We approve of the exemption of agricultural land and of the concession made with regard to the assessment of Income Tax on agricultural land, and we repudiate the doctrine that there is any monopoly in land. Neither do we object to the valuation of land so long as it is carried out by experts, as it is in India. For any one who has been connected with the administration of India land valuation has no terror. And we believe that valuation with regard to agricultural land will explode a great many of the fallacies with reference to the site value of agricultural land. If the capital spent on improvements is taken and the maintenance charges, the site value of agricultural land will be very slight indeed. The President of the Surveyors' Institute said lately that the capital value of agricultural land
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0602"/>
<col>1191</col>
in thirty years was depreciated by about &#x00A3;900,000,000. This shows the fundamental difference between urban land and agricultural land, because in the case of urban land there has been a general increase in value, and in the case of agricultural land depreciation.<lb/>
Now with regard to the Income Tax the Death Duties, and the Super-Tax, perhaps the House will allow me to give a few figures, and they will be the only figures I shall give. I have here a carefully drafted return under the heads of Income Tax, Death Duties, and Super-Tax in the case of estates of the capital value of &#x00A3;50,000, &#x00A3;100,000, &#x00A3;250,000, &#x00A3;500,000 and &#x00A3;1,000,000 respectively, each yielding an average return of three per cent., the owner insuring himself against Death Duties on a three per cent. basis, with the assumed expectation of life of twenty years, and the amount of the insurance being so adjusted as to leave the net capital value unaltered after the payment of the Death Duties. It is presumed that the property is being left to lineals or to a widow. I shall only give the totals; I shall not weary the house with details. In the case of an estate of &#x00A3;50,000 the taxes payable under the Budget of 1908&#x2013;09 were &#x00A3;168; under this Budget the figure would be &#x00A3;240. An estate of &#x00A3;100,000 under the former Budget, &#x00A3;375; under this Budget, &#x00A3;567. An estate of &#x00A3;250,000, under the former Budget &#x00A3;1,144; under this Budget &#x00A3;1,789. An estate of &#x00A3;500,000, under the former Budget &#x00A3;2,498; under this Budget &#x00A3;3,821. An estate of &#x00A3;1,000,000, under the former Budget &#x00A3;5,472; under this Budget &#x00A3;9,171. No doubt these increases are not light, but then this is an Imperial Budget for Imperial needs, and at a moment when the Colonies are preparing to bear their fair share of the burden is it desirable for us to set the example of saying that we do not wish to undertake our share of that burden?<lb/>
In a recent speech at P&#x00E9;rigueux the Prime Minister of France, M. Briand, spoke to this effect: "We are obliged to impose sacrifices, and we trust you will do your patriotic duty with regard to the sacrifices, which we shall make as slight as we possibly can under the circumstances." We do not desire to see the credit of the country shaken in any way or London to cease to be what it is now, the centre of the world's finance; and we wish the defences
<col>1192</col>
of the country placed on a secure footing. But we view with alarm the increase of expenditure, and wish to see a rigorous scrutiny applied to expenditure in the future. We consider that the constant increase of armaments all over the world is an international question which must be dealt with by diplomatic negotiations between the Powers chiefly concerned. We do not doubt that the Government will take the opportunity whenever a favourable occasion arises. We are in favour of expenditure on education and sanitation, because we consider that thereby the earning power of the wage-earner is increased. We do not believe in the readjustment of the inequalities which exist in the present social condition by means of taxation.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Morley justly observed, neither this Budget nor any other Budget can create a Millennium, but this Budget will certainly not create a Pandemonium. We object to any policy which would stir up instead of subdue class antagonism. We are opposed to Socialism, and because we are opposed to Socialism we support this Budget, which we believe will not create grievances such as would arise under a Budget which increased the burden of indirect taxation. The spread of Socialism in Germany is mainly due to the system of taxation and to the high rate of national expenditure. Neither do we believe that this Budget will diminish what Mill called "the effective desire of accumulation." We do not consider that thrift will receive from this Budget a check, and that the growth of British capital will be imperilled if this Budget is adopted. With regard to the employment, or the investment, of British capital abroad, in addition to what has been said on this side of the House there is perhaps, one element which has not yet been alluded to. If capital is invested in a country with a high tariff the interest accruing on that capital is used for the payment of the imports, the needful imports, from that country. For instance, the export of grain and foodstuffs from America can be paid by the interest on the securities held by British capitalists in America, and by that means you can defeat the bad results of a high tariff because the exports from this country which you would have to send to pay for the imports might perhaps meet with difficulties. And then the payment can
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0603"/>
<col>1193</col>
be made, as I have shown, by the interest which accrues to the capital invested in such a country. We do not believe that the money taken by the State, if wisely spent, will increase unemployment. Extravagant expenditure on the part of the State is as much to be deprecated as extravagant expenditure by individuals. In both cases, whether the money is spent by the individual or by the State, with regard to employment it depends on the question whether such expenditure is remunerative or not.<lb/>
Now with regard to the constitutional question. We do not wish to see the constitutional practice which gives the House of Commons control of the finances of the country upset. We do not believe in the doctrine of mandate, a doctrine which would sap the independence of the representatives of the people. We do not accept the novel doctrine that this House can dictate an appeal to the country. An appeal to the country on one subject, which with a referendum would be possible, would not, under the circumstances in which an appeal will take place here, give the verdict of the country on the Budget, because the verdict will be on a variety of issues. We are strongly in favour of a Second Chamber, but we consider that it imperils its authority, perhaps even its existence, by exceeding the limitations which the Constitution has imposed on it. We agree with Lord Balfour that a referendum on matters of finance would make a most momentous change in the Constitution as it has grown up, and that there must be a considerable amount of give and take in the relations between the two Houses, as was shown in the very eloquent speech of my noble and learned friend Lord James of Hereford. Many Liberals, therefore, consider that it is their duty to support the Government and not to incur any responsibility for a crisis which will submit to the judgment of the country much wider issues than the issues which may be involved in some of the novel features of this Budget&#x2014;issues which hitherto Statesmen on both sides of the House have desired carefully to avoid. Let us not forget the lesson of history, that oligarchies are seldom destroyed and more frequently commit suicide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03659"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KNARESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, practically everything which can be said on the financial proposals of the Government
<col>1194</col>
has already been said in this House. I myself have an excellent speech on the Budget in my pocket, but I must ask you to take it on trust, for it will remain there. But I wish to say a few words about the Amendment before the House, and on the Division which is to be taken to-morrow. The noble Lord who spoke last gave us some figures concerning the cost to the inheritor of various duties which I think may perhaps be rather misleading. I have just worked out a case which was suggested to me&#x2014;it may be a very hard one. We will suppose one of your Lordships owns an estate valued at a little over &#x00A3;1,000,000. You have had two sons. The elder has died, leaving you a grandson. The grandson inherits, and he has to pay in Death Duties &#x00A3;158,500. The estate, valued at a little over &#x00A3;1,000,000 cannot possibly bring in net more than &#x00A3;30,000 a year. That is equivalent to confiscating the whole income of the estate for five years. Now carry this a little further. Let us suppose this grandson is a minor and the last in entail; the estates could not therefore be re-settled. We will suppose that during his minority the whole of this large sum is paid off. He succeeds at the age of twenty-one and dies shortly afterwards, leaving the estate, as he naturally would do, to your second son, his uncle, who would succeed to the title. The second son would have to pay a sum of &#x00A3;235,000. The estate would have first gone to your grandson and then back to your second son and the State would have taken out of it &#x00A3;393,500.<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke last seems to consider this a very moderate amount, but let us try to see ourselves as others see us. Supposing this had taken place elsewhere, say in Turkey at the time Mr. Gladstone was conducting his fiery campaign against the Turk. Supposing he had got hold of a case of this sort in which a rich landowner had died, and the Sultan had exacted &#x00A3;158,500 from the son, and when the son died leaving the estate to his uncle the Sultan had exacted &#x00A3;235,500, making &#x00A3;393,500, what would Mr. Gladstone and the papers which sup-ported him at that time have said? Would they not have pointed out that no country could flourish, financially or agriculturally, where such exactions were possible I Would they not have said it was a folly, almost a crime, for any English people to lend money to such a nation? But
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0604"/>
<col>1195</col>
the irony of events is very strange. A few years ago Liberal politicians were holding up Turkey as an example and a warning, and now, except for the protection of your Lordships' House, which they wish to destroy, property is far safer in Turkey than it is in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I am not going to pursue the Budget any further. I should like to be allowed to say a very few words on the Amendment before the House and the Division which is to follow it. Now, my Lords, I do not suppose anything I shall say will have any effect on noble Lords opposite. I am not addressing my remarks to noble Lords on the other side of the House. I have no doubt they have made up their minds to swallow their medicine, and when you have made up your mind to swallow your medicine it is probably wiser not to examine the ingredients too closely, but to shut your eyes and swallow it down quickly, however black the draught may be. Nor do I propose to address myself particularly to those on our side of the House who have made up their minds to vote for the Amendment, but there are some to whom it has seemed very attractive to abstain from voting, and it is especially to them I wish to address my remarks.<lb/>
I know how unbecoming it would be for one who is a comparatively newcomer among you, to attempt to advise your Lordships how you should give your votes; but I hope I may be allowed to make an humble appeal to your Lordships on account of our Unionist Members and of the candidates who are to fight this battle for us. Our Unionist Members have fought a gallant fight in the House of Commons. They are worn out and exhausted by all-night sittings and a session of extraordinary length. They have now without any rest to start again and fight an election campaign, and I want to appeal to you not to stultify their efforts in the House of Commons and dishearten them for the contest, by any want of unity on this side of the House. Two noble Lords, Lord Cromer and Lord Balfour of Burleigh, made most valuable contributions to the debate, but to our great disappointment they ended by announcing that they would not vote for the Amendment, but would abstain from voting. Now what will the consequences of that announcement be? I believe that a thousand Liberal speakers
<col>1196</col>
have already made notes, either mental or in their pocket books, of these announcements as a most important point to make in their forthcoming speeches, and I believe that every one of the thousand believes that votes will be transferred from our side to the other in consequence of these announcements. Lord Avebury has told us on how few votes a majority at a General Election depends, and every Unionist Peer who abstains or votes against the Amendment will transfer votes from our side to the other. How could it be otherwise? Every one of you has influence in his own neighbourhood.<lb/>
I imagine I am at a Liberal meeting and an oleaginous gentleman comes forward and says&#x2014;
<quote>" My dear friends, I am happy to be able to reassure you on the subject of this beautiful Budget. You know your friend and neighbour, Lord So-and-So; you know how good, how charitable a man he is! What excellent judgment!&#x2014;</quote>
You may be sure you will be dressed up in beautiful clothes for the occasion&#x2014;
<quote>" And did Lord So-and-so vote against the Budget? No! my friends, I knew before I ever scanned the list that the name of Lord So-and-so would never be found voting against this magnificent Budget! "</quote>
Well, now, what sort of effect would this have on an elector who had always voted Liberal, but who was frightened at the Budget, and who was thinking of voting for our side? Would he not be re-assured? Would he not say to himself, "Lord So-and-so has had the opportunity of hearing both sides of the question. He has heard the debate in the House of Lords. He is far harder hit by the Budget than I am; surely if it is good enough for him, it is good enough for me." I am sure that I shall be borne out by all the noble Lords in the House who are experienced in elections. In the turmoil of a General Election there is no room for fine-drawn distinctions. To use an Americanism, "we have ' no use ' for fine-drawn distinctions." The electors do not understand them, and will have none of them. Every Peer who votes for the Amendment will be held to be against the Budget; and every Peer who deliberately abstains will be held to be in favour of the Budget, the whole Budget, and nothing but the Budget&#x0021;<lb/>
You may say all this is self-evident, but the gospel of abstention has been
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0605"/>
<col>1197</col>
preached by three notable apostles. Three noble Lords of commanding ability, immense experience, and the highest character have announced that they will not vote for this Amendment. I listened most attentively to the speeches of these three noble Lords, and I find them all lacking in one important particular. They are, inconclusive. They showed us the pitfalls but they did not show us the path. They all condemned the Budget root and branch. We all know that they wish the Amendment had not been brought forward; but now that it has been brought forward do they wish us to vote for it, or against it, or to abstain? We have heard a great deal of a&#x00EB;roplanes lately. I imagine myself in the country on a wintry day. The barometer is at stormy; dark clouds are drifting overhead. I wish for a clearer view of the country. I get into my aeroplane; I mount; I mount higher and higher. The view is magnificent, everything is becoming clear, when, suddenly all is darkness and obscurity. What has happened? I have run into the clouds. This seems to me the case, with the three noble Lords. We have been carried away on the wings of their eloquence, we have mounted higher and higher till we soared with them in the loftiest regions of statesmanship and politics. Then they led us into the clouds and left us there.<lb/>
My Lords, this is not a debating society; we are engaged in practical business of a most important kind. We must assume that the speeches of the noble Lords were designed to have some political effect on this debate, and on the Division which will follow it. But what effect? To be able to say <i>Liberavi animam meam</i> is no doubt a great relief to the sufferer, but how did they mean their speeches to affect <i>animas nostras?</i> To make my meaning clear let us imagine that, one of the genii of the Arabian Nights were to appear to-night to each of the three noble Lords, and were to say to them, "If you will say the word, I will cast such a magic spell over the minds of all the noble Lords on this side of the House that when the critical moment arrives, when the Division is called to-morrow night, they will all follow your example and troop solemnly out of the House behind you, without voting, leaving our noble Leader, who has moved this Amendment, to go into the Lobby alone." Would they say the word? Do they wish to be left to plough their three solitary furrows alone,
<col>1198</col>
or do they wish for companions? Do they, like Saul, aspire to be leaders of a host, or are they content with the mantle of Jeremiah?<lb/>
I know there are some who think that it is unwise to carry this Amendment, for fear that worse will follow. But what worse can follow? That the House of Lords may be abolished? But I am quite certain of this, that if you lose the power, either by voluntary abdication or the will of the people, to oppose Finance Bills of this character, then this House had better cease to exist. The State, the Empire, and the individual can be ruined by so-called Finance Bills just as easily as in any other way. If a single Chamber is to have unbridled power, then let only a single Chamber exist. For your Lordships to sit here and pass Bills of which you profoundly disapprove, with no power either to amend or reject them, would be neither dignified nor profitable. Much better let the electors realise that unbridled power is being given to their representatives and they will at once set to work to devise some means of keeping power in their own hands. What expedients they would devise, whether it would be a referendum, or annual Parliaments or triennial Parliaments, or what it would be, I cannot say; but something they would certainly devise. And if the field of battle is to be the House of Commons alone, then the great abilities of many of your Lordships will be far better employed there, where the real battle is being fought, rather than here, where only academic discussions could take place. In any case, if the House of Lords were abolished you might derive some cynical amusement from seeing the effect which the abolition of this House would have upon the group of very rich men supporting the Government, which they are so fond of boasting about.<lb/>
In conclusion, I will only say that beyond political and Party considerations there is the sound commonsense of the country to reckon with. If the sound commonsense of the country deliberately wishes for socialistic legislation, confiscation of capital, and abolition of your Lordships' House, then, certainly, socialistic legislation will be carried, capital will be confiscated, and the House of Lords will be abolished in spite of anything that you can do. But give the sound commonsense of the country a chance. Then if history has to record the fall of this
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0606"/>
<col>1199</col>
ancient House, let it record also that while it existed its members had the courage of their convictions and fell fighting gloriously in a just cause&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03660"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is evident that short speeches are now the order of the day, and I trust I shall not offend by exceeding the limit that now seems appropriate. I desire, however, with your Lordships' permission, to make a few general observations and then to refer to one particular point which I have very much at heart, and which has not received any attention in this Debate until it was raised by my noble friend on my left. As regards the general observations I wish to make I trust that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will not deem me presumptuous if I make so bold as to use his speech as the peg on which to hang my argument. The noble and learned Lord asked us to consider what would be the consequences of adopting the step recommended by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. But the noble and learned Lord did not seem to have considered&#x2014;he certainly did not ask us to consider&#x2014;what would be the consequences of taking the alternative course and passing this Bill. I venture to say with all respect that this rather one-sided view of a question which undoubtedly has two sides on the part of the Lord Chancellor was disappointing to a great many of us. We are, of course, aware that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack is a Minister of the Crown and that he must therefore speak as a Party politician, but we certainly hoped that in a question involving a grave constitutional issue he, at any rate, would have sought to give us guidance by a reference to both sides of the question.<lb/>
The fact is that from whatever point of view we regard our duty on this occasion we find ourselves in a grave dilemma. It is impossible for us to adopt any course which will not be displeasing to a large number, possibly one half, of our fellow-countrymen, and it is not possible for us to adopt any course which will not, in a greater or lesser measure, imperil the balance of forces in the Constitution. It is impossible to say at the present time whether, if we adopt one course or the other, we shall offend the greater or the lesser number of our fellow-countrymen, but certain it is that if we were to pass this Bill we should incur the contempt of all those who look to this House to give
<col>1200</col>
pause to legislation which has excited apprehension, which has given rise to unusual excitement, or which, to put it in another way, has not received a popular mandate. But if, on the other hand, we adopt the course recommended by the noble Marquess it is equally certain that we shall incur the resentment of all those who regard this Budget as a first step towards the attainment of the policy which they have at heart&#x2014;namely, the fundamental change of our political and social system. If we take the course which is pleasing to those who are friendly to this House there can be no question that we shall imperil the balance of forces in the Constitution. As evidence of that we have the threat or warning&#x2014;a warning which, if I am not mistaken, was very carefully drafted before hand&#x2014;which fell from the lips of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack.<lb/>
But if we seek to conciliate those whom we regard as the aggressors, those who are not friendly to this House, is it not certain that we shall establish a precedent which will indubitably be used to reduce the Second Chamber to impotence? I noticed that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack omitted to mention the warning or threat which his friends apply to this contingency. But we have heard it, and there is no mistake about it. Even if we were to pass this Budget, what has been said by every Radical speaker all over the country? That they will not have done with the House of Lords, that their desire for abolishing the veto of the House of Lords&#x2014;that is to say, reducing this House to practical impotence&#x2014;will remain the same as ever. We may be misinformed, but we have a pretty shrewd opinion that, supposing we had passed this Budget, there was a little scheme on the part of the Government to dissolve Parliament in February and appeal to the country for a fresh lease of power and a mandate against the House of Lords on the score of their contemptible weakness and pusillanimity in this matter. If this is not the case perhaps the noble Lord who is going to speak after me will deny it.<lb/>
I venture to say again with great respect that the argument, all the arguments, in the speech of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack cut both ways. His principal objection to the course we are taking, besides the one which was founded on the opinion that it was unconstitutional, was that if we once did this thing of which
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0607"/>
<col>1201</col>
he disapproved we should always be doing it, that we should get into a bad habit. Can you not apply the same arguments to the House of Commons and say if they once resort to the expedient of "tacking" they will always go on doing it? Nevertheless it seems to have become part of the creed of the Liberal Party in connection with the discussion of this measure that nothing but abuse can sanction the use of a right, that if a right is not abused, if it remains dormant because there has been no occasion to use it, therefore it must necessarily expire and cease to exist.<lb/>
The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India made use of a very similar argument, which I venture to think also can be turned against him in exactly the same way as he used it against us. The noble Viscount made five points. He said five propositions were involved in the Amendment proposed by the noble Marquess. The first was, he said, that we were arrogating to ourselves the control of taxation. Well, my answer to the noble Viscount is that that is just what he is doing, that is just what the Government are doing through the House of Commons. The control of taxation belongs to both Houses of Parliament. The proof of that is to be found in the preamble of this Pill, which runs exactly the same as the preamble of every other Pill, namely that the enactment is to be "by and with the consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal." Rut I noticed when the Lord Chancellor was enumerating the various points of Parliamentary practice upon which he based his argument that he omitted to mention this one, which seems to me to be by itself pretty conclusive.<lb/>
The next proposition set forth by the noble Viscount was that we were assuming a power of penal Dissolution. My answer to the noble Viscount is that the Government are assuming a power of penal administration. If they cannot get their Bills passed in the manner which has been customary and according to the Constitution they introduce them into their Budget in order to do what they call in their jargon "get even" with the House of Lords, and "get even" with the licensed trade. The proposition of the noble Viscount was that this action will be repeated whenever the House of Commons displeases your Lordships' House. Can we not reply with equal fairness and equal logic that the House of Commons will
<col>1202</col>
tack Bills on to their Finance Bill whenever the action of the House of Lords displeases them? Then again the noble Viscount said, and no doubt the phrase will be much quoted, that we are turning a representative supremacy into an oligarchic supremacy. I submit that the nation is represented not by the House of Commons only but by Parliament as a whole, and that what the Government are trying to do, if they succeed in the policy of reducing this House to impotence, would be to establish the much smaller oligarchic supremacy of the Cabinet. It is needless to remind you that under the present Parliamentary system the majority of the present House of Commons are merely tools in the hands of the executive Government of the day.<lb/>
To return to my argument, I say that, with so little to choose between the alternative dangers and disagreeables which are involved in either of the alternative courses which are open to us, there is absolutely nothing to prejudice or weaken that sense of duty with which this House always has and always will discharge its appointed task. The only question before us is "What is our duty?" And on that point I need only say that I agree most fully with all that has been said by those who have supported the Amendment of the noble Marquess. But I venture to think that there is yet another reason, a reason which seems to me to be at least as important as those which have already been put forward, for referring this Budget&#x2014;and when I say the Budget I mean the whole policy involved in the Budget&#x2014;to the nation. The criticism thus far has mainly been directed to the methods by which the taxes are to be raised. There has been less mention of the purposes for which they are to be raised, and it is in this latter respect that I beg your Lordships' consideration of one particular point.<lb/>
I maintain that we ought to refer this Budget to the people because it does not provide adequately for national security. Eight months ago His Majesty's Ministers, of their own accord, came down and told an awe-struck House of Commons firstly that they had completely miscalculated the rate of progress of German naval construction; secondly, that Germany had developed a power of building and arming Dreadnoughts equal to, if not superior to, our own; and, thirdly&#x2014;the most startling of all&#x2014;that the entire British Fleet would
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0608"/>
<col>1203</col>
have to be reconstructed. Now what did the Government do? Did they call upon the nation at once to put forward her whole energy and might in order to meet this great danger from without? Did they shape their Budget so as to meet this supreme need? Did they seek to unite all classes in a patriotic determination to discharge that first and most human duty of all, the duty of self-preservation? My Lords, they did none of these things. On the contrary they chose the very moment of national awakening to a great peril, which has long been perceived by those who make a study of these things but not by the people at large, to provoke a bitter internal conflict, to stir up a class war, to embitter Party animosity, all for the sake of their own Party policy; and they thus made of the nation "a house divided against itself," instead of a united nation determined to sacrifice anything rather than imperil her liberties and her honour. Can there be any doubt whatever what the response would have been if His Majesty's Government had adopted the other course, if they had claimed the support of all patriotic men to a policy of providing beyond all shadow of doubt for the security of the nation? I retort on the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India that the Government made a great tactical mistake. If they had made such an appeal there would have been no question whatever about assenting cheerfully to additional taxation fairly adjusted between all classes. Not only sixteen millions but twenty millions, thirty millions would have been voted without serious objection. What has come of the brave words of the Prime Minister, who said in the House of Commons on the 16th of March&#x2014;
<quote>" Any Government which sacrifices national safety to any question of expediency would be worthy of severe condemnation."</quote>
Those words are not too high in which to describe the duty of the Government, for surely nobody will deny that it is the first duty of every Government, the highest duty of every Government, to protect the State against external aggression.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03661">What, again, has come of the words of the Foreign Secretary who, above all ought to know, and I believe does know the real nature of the danger? Sir Edward Grey, on the 19th of February, used memorable words. He said&#x2014;
<quote>" There is no half-way house in naval affairs between complete safety and absolute ruin."</quote>
<col>1204</col>
Now will anybody dare to say we have complete safety at the present moment, or that this Budget attempts to provide for complete safety? I am not going to take up your Lordships' time, in view of what I said at the outset, by going into details. The facts, moreover, are familiar to all your Lordships. There are, however, certain circumstances which it is just as well to bear in mind, which we ought to bear in mind, and which I shall merely enumerate.<lb/>
In the first place the two-Power standard, that rule of thumb on which the nation has relied and which has given confidence to the nation in each successive Government, was abandoned on the 26th of May, when the Prime Minister qualified his previous explicit declarations and pledges in such a manner as to render them ineffective for any practical purpose. In the second place, for the first time that memory can recall, the votes for new construction in our Estimates are less than those of a single other Power. Then, again, we know that Germany can now construct and arm fourteen Dreadnoughts simultaneously against the eight which we are able to construct and arm at the same time. Germany will be able to dock and repair nine Dreadnoughts on the North Sea coast while we, until 1915, shall not be able to dock and repair more than three Dreadnoughts at the same time. The shortage of medium cruisers and destroyers, to which my noble friend referred, is a matter of common notoriety. The most important point of all is the shortage of men. The <i>personnel</i> was reduced, and I believe I am right in saying that during the last three years not a single man has been added to the establishment of the Navy. It takes longer to make a sailor than it does to build a Dreadnought, and if we are to man the new ships that are built we shall want 15,000 men whom we cannot possibly improvise. What steps have been taken to provide them?<lb/>
Lastly there is the question of the four contingent Dreadnoughts concerning which we remain in grave doubt. Are they really to be part of this year's programme or are they to be counted in next year's programme? I will not go into the question, for your Lordships know very well what reason we have for mistrusting the Government on this point. Those who dwell on these facts are not alarmists.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0609"/>
<col>1205</col>
The gigantic development of German naval power is surely not for parade, for show, or for any academic purpose. Surely we have a right to assume, nay more, a duty to assume, that what Germany can do she may do at any time without asking "By your leave," and without consulting us as to the time and the object. The gravity of the danger is best measured by the words of the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, whom nobody will accuse of being an alarmist. Sir Edward Grey, speaking of what would be the result of the loss of our naval supremacy, said on the 29th of March&#x2014;
<quote>" We should cease to count for anything among the nations of Europe, and we should be fortunate if our liberty were left and if we did not become the conscript appendage of some stronger Power."</quote>
Surely no graver, no more impressive warning has ever been addressed to the Parliament of Great Britain. And is it not strange that nothing of that warning is reflected in the financial policy of His Majesty's Government as shown in this Budget? The results of Radical policy in regard to the Navy prove beyond question that any relaxation of effort on our part, so far from inducing other Powers to arrest the growth of their navies, encourages at any rate one. Power to redoubled efforts. That is a fact which is absolutely beyond dispute.<lb/>
Now, I say that the Government ought to have recognised their initial mistake. They proceeded at first on the assumption that if they reduced our Fleet other Powers would follow suit. When they saw that that was not the case they ought to have recognised their mistake, and they ought to have made it clear in this Budget, which was drafted and conceived immediately after the alarming period which is popularly known as the "Naval scare," that we mean at all hazards to keep our place in the race of armaments, and that it is absolutely vain and futile for any other nation to attempt to overtake us by a sudden sprint or to catch us napping. That, as my noble friend on my left said, would have been the truest economy in the long run. Instead of doing that His Majesty's Government have chosen to persuade the people of this country to once more "sleep in their beds." They have again lulled them into that sense of false security which it is so easy to inspire in the people of this country. They have distracted their attention from this supreme and overwhelmingly important
<col>1206</col>
question by dallying with Socialistic dreams and putting forward pottering schemes for rounding off the sharp corners of motor roads throughout the country. To those who have put forward a plea on behalf of national security they have replied with unworthy sneers about clamouring for Dreadnoughts and not wishing to pay for them. No grosser misrepresentation has ever been made seeing that not one penny of these new taxes is to be applied, or is required, for new construction in the Navy, and that the three millions for new construction is met by the reduction of the Sinking Fund.<lb/>
I hold that the Constitution was made for Great Britain and not Great Britain for the Constitution. Therefore I have no shadow of doubt that it is our duty to risk even the Constitution in order that we may give the nation an opportunity, before it is too late, of deciding whether they prefer Socialistic experiments to the safety of the realm. Nothing I have heard in this debate has altered my profound conviction that a measure advocated as this measure has been advocated cannot be a righteous measure. It has had to be recommended to the people by appeals to class prejudice, by gross personal attacks on individuals, by misrepresentations as inconsistent as they are varied, of which, by the way, we had an example in the speech of the noble Lord the President of the Board of Agriculture. I say that a cause which has to be recommended in that way cannot be for the good of the nation as a whole. But the nation alone can decide in such a case, and whether the decision be for or against the policy of the Budget&#x2014;for let us not forget for one moment to impress upon the people that it is not the Budget but the policy of the Budget, everything that is connoted in the Budget, a Budget which is the climax and the outcome of years of Radical policy, the policy which aims at the abolition of the veto of the House of Lords&#x2014;whether the decision is for or against that policy I am perfectly certain the nation will not blame those who are not afraid to refer the question to their judgment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03662"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the speech to which we have just listened the noble Lord has mentioned gross personal attacks on individuals, I presume on individuals on that side of the House. May I remind him of one or two expressions which have already been used during the course of this debate? One speaker has
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0610"/>
<col>1207</col>
alluded to the "vulgarity" of Mr. Lloyd-George, and another speaker&#x2014;I think it was Lord Newton&#x2014;spoke also in an eloquent peroration of the "nauseating cant" of Mr. Winston Churchill. I propose to show by a few quotations I have by me the typical style of platform oratory that has found favour with distinguished members of the Party opposite.<lb/>
First of all I think it would be only right and fitting and respectful that I should deal with the utterances of one or two of what Lord Rosebery terms that "poor but honest class," the Dukes. I will begin with the most moderate and go on to the more violent of those particular utterances. First of all I will take that of the Duke of Rutland. The noble Duke, speaking at Haddon Hall, on September 18, is reported to have said that the Liberals were a crew of "piratical tatterdemalions." I am not quite sure what he meant by that term. I do not wish in the least to complain of that particular utterance, for, after all, the platform speeches of the noble Duke occasionally have a subtle charm which gives them a great deal of interest, even to opponents. On another occasion the Duke of Rutland is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>" He would like to place a gag into the mouths of all the members of the Labour Party in the House of Commons."</quote>
I have no doubt possibly the Duke of Rutland would like to place a gag into the mouths of all his Liberal opponents as well. That would greatly simplify the controversy on the issues of the Finance Bill.<lb/>
I next come to the Duke of Beaufort. I see that he was at a function at Cirencester on August 7. There were calls towards the end for a speech from the Duke of Beaufort, and the Duke of Beaufort "good humouredly" responded to these and made reply&#x2014;
<quote>"I should like to see Winston Churchill and Lloyd-George in the middle of twenty couple of dog hounds. (Laughter and applause.)"</quote>
Well, my Lords, that was surely a noble and pleasing sentiment. But your Lordships will observe that "the Duke of Beaufort good humouredly responded." Really, I think the noble Duke must possess the grimmest sense of humour of any individual I have met or heard of in my life. Then I pass by without comment a letter from another noble Duke, the Duke
<col>1208</col>
of Somerset, who I do not think is in the House this evening&#x2014;a letter of the type to which we have become rather accustomed throughout this controversy, containing a thinly-veiled threat that he would discharge estate hands and reduce his subscription to charities and other associations and so forth, should this Budget pass into law. I pass that by without comment.<lb/>
I come to the speech of a distinguished member of the other House, Mr. Joynson-Hicks. As your Lordships may be aware, Mr. Joynson-Hicks is one of the distinguished men of the Tory Party in the House of Commons. Speaking at Manchester&#x2014;I have not the exact date, but I think it was recently&#x2014;he made the following remarkable statement. As I see at all events one noble Duke opposite in his place I would like to assure him these views are not my views but the views of Mr. Joynson-Hicks. He used these words&#x2014;
<quote>" He only wished the Dukes had held their tongues, every one of them. It would have been a good deal better for the Conservative Party if, before the Budget was introduced, every Duke had been locked up and kept locked up until the Budget was over."</quote>
I grieve to say these are the actual words of this person, this Mr. Joynson-Hicks. And he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>" These men who are going about squealing and saying they are going to reduce their subscriptions to charities and football clubs because they were being unduly taxed ought to be ashamed of themselves, Dukes or no Dukes."</quote>
God forbid I should ever, in any platform utterance or elsewhere, use language like that about a Duke or any other member of your Lordships' House. But I suppose it was utterances of this kind to which the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby De Broke, referred when he spoke about the claptrap which had been talked about the Dukes.<lb/>
Then I come to a long letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> on August 13 from Mr. Hiram Howell, the Tory candidate for, I believe, North Manchester. He said&#x2014;
<quote>" The Lancashire working men were sick of the selfish cry of ' Property, property, property ' and he wished that someone would give the Dukes a hint, if they had not already done so, to put away their pocket handkerchiefs."</quote>
My Lords, I wonder whether anybody did give the Dukes a hint to put away their pocket handkerchiefs. I notice that so
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0611"/>
<col>1209</col>
far in this long debate, almost unprecedented in length in this House, only two noble Dukes, of a roll of some twenty-eight, have so far taken part in these proceedings. All I can say is that if they did receive a hint to put away their pocket handkerchiefs I would like to congratulate both those noble Dukes who have taken part in this debate&#x2014;the Duke of Norfolk and his colleague the Duke of Marlborough&#x2014;upon their glorious and splendid act of disobedience. I pass from the utterances of those noblemen to others of, perhaps, lesser importance but men also of high station and of noble birth. I will take, for instance, the case of Sir Spencer Maryon-Wilson. Your Lordships may, perhaps, have seen a letter which appeared in the Press in which Sir Spencer Maryon-Wilson directed his tenants to address him not as "Dear Sir," but as "Sir Baronet." I observed in the local papers in two consecutive weeks a notice signed by Sir Spencer Maryon-Wilson, owner of the Rectory Field, Blackheath, to the effect that in the event of the land clauses of the Finance Bill being passed he would be compelled, much against his will, to sell the Rectory Field at Blackheath. A fortnight later there appeared the following notice&#x2014;
<quote>" Sir Spencer Maryon-Wilson has taken an estate of some 30,000 acres belonging to the Dowager-Countess of Seafield for the shooting."</quote>
It is hard to believe in the abject poverty of people who can rent large estates for the shooting. I have no personal feeling whatever against Sir Spencer Maryon-Wilson. I only quote this as an instance of the sort of pressure which is being brought to bear by well-to-do people upon people who are poor or less well-to-do, and which is really in the nature of threats of what will happen should this Budget pass into law. Then I come to the utterances of another, I have no doubt distinguished, man, Sir Gray Humberstone Skipwith, who is reported to have said in a recent speech at Shipston-on-Stour that the Lord Advocate was one of the most unprincipled blackguards living, that Mr. Lloyd-George ought to have been shot, and that if the Budget passed not only would he not help to resist an invasion of our shores but would actually welcome the invaders. Such, my Lords, is the patriotism of Sir Gray Humberstone d'Estoteville Skipwith, Bart&#x0021;<lb/>
I may be told that these men, although, no doubt, distinguished men, and men of
<col>1210</col>
great influence in those parts of England where they reside, are not, after all, men in official positions. I agree that it is possible that none of those gentlemen whom I have mentioned is ever likely to hold either the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer or that of President of the Board of Trade, but I will proceed to quote the utterance of a very distinguished official member of the Tory Party, Sir Alexander Acland-Hood, who, as your Lordships are all aware, has been Chief Whip of the Tory Party for a considerable number of years. I, too, as the House may be aware, have been for some years a Whip in this House, but I do not presume to compare my own position in any sense with that occupied by Sir Alexander Acland-Hood, because the Whip of the Liberal Party in this House, in my opinion at all events, has neither power, nor authority, nor patronage, nor influence of any kind. But in the other House the official title of Chief Whip, that of Patronage Secretary to the Treasury, explains one of the sources of the great influence which undoubtedly belongs to his office. And, further, the position of Chief Whip in the House of Commons is frequently a direct stepping stone to higher rank, even to Cabinet rank. I take the cases of my right hon. friend Mr. Arnold Morley; of our late friend on this side, Lord Tweedmouth; of the present Home Secretary, and of a distinguished member of the Party opposite, Lord Waleran, who have all stepped straight from the Whips' Room in the House of Commons to the Cabinet. Therefore I do not in any sense underrate the importance of Sir Alexander Acland-Hood; indeed I can well conceive of his occupying the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Tariff Reform Government. Speaking last year at Kingston, near Taunton, in Somersetshire, Sir Alexander Acland-Hood in an eloquent peroration, said the members of the Government had "faces like sausages or suet puddings." He was speaking at the time of political cartoons or caricatures, and he said, you could not caricature the faces of members of the Government on that account.<lb/>
I speak without any animus at all in this matter against Sir Alexander Acland-Hood because I do not think he had in his mind those members of the Government who are also members of His Majesty's Household, and who, as a rule, are spared the distinction or the terror, as the case may be, of the political
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0612"/>
<col>1211</col>
cartoonists, with the exception, I am bound to say, of my noble friend the Lord Chamberlain, who at all events may, I think, be able to rest easy under this particular charge. I should like to ask this question. Sir Alexander Acland-Hood is well known to be Mr. Balfour's right-hand man. He says as much in the very speech from which I am quoting. I would like to ask some member of the Front Bench opposite whether Sir Alexander Acland-Hood was carrying out Mr. Balfour's instructions when he made this particular speech. And if his view is not the view of Mr. Balfour, is it the view of the noble Marquess opposite and his colleagues on the Front Opposition Bench? I await with interest an answer on that particular point. I do not pretend that it is a very pleasant task going into this question of the personalities that have been flying about lately, but really noble Lords opposite, or some of them at all events, appear to think that they and some of their friends can use any sort of language on the platform with absolute freedom and irresponsibility; and therefore when you talk to me about the vulgarity of Mr. Lloyd-George I retort "What about the polished metaphors of Sir Alexander Acland-Hood?"<lb/>
I pass from that to what I believe is the general conception of a good many members of the Party opposite of what the system of Government which obtains in this country is. Let us say that a Tory Government comes into power and stays in power ten years. During that time we are not, as a rule, overburdened in the matter of legislation, but the work of administration is heavy, and is growing heavier year by year, and so heavy does this become that after a prolonged period of office Tory Statesmen, worn out by their labours and by the strenuous resistance that they offer to reforms of any kind, require a rest. It is for this purpose and on these occasions that a Liberal Government really becomes quite useful. It is true that it is unpleasant to see persons in high positions who are not members of the ruling families in this country. It is true that just for the look of the thing a certain number of Liberal measures, carefully watered down, may be allowed to pass into law. But, I repeat, Cabinet Ministers require a rest, and there must be a redistribution, not a redistribution of seats but of offices. The "Elder Statesmen," if I may quote a phrase used by our Japanese allies, must, in the natural
<col>1212</col>
course of things, retire. Places must be found for younger men, not, indeed, so good as their merits entitle them to, but good enough, perhaps, to keep them quiet for the time being. Then, if measures are introduced and we do not like them, after all there is always the House of Lords which can be counted upon to cripple or reject any Liberal measure and which now, apparently, is claiming the right to force a Dissolution upon the country whenever it pleases.<lb/>
In this country, where games and sports play a large part in our national life, it is frequently the custom to compare politics to a game. I also will compare them with a game in which the element of chance enters but little. This is not an original comparison of mine, but I think it is an apt comparison. It is a game called, "Heads you win, tails we lose." If we suggest very mildly and deferentially that the rules of the game might with advantage undergo some slight alteration then you get hold of words like "Socialist," and "Revolutionist," and "Anarchist," and any other long, dreadful-sounding words ending in "ist" you can find and you sling them at our heads from every platform in the country. If, further, there should rise to high positions, to high office, men who have the courage to stand up for their own side, and not only that but inspire courage in others and infuse a ray of hope into the minds of men bent and bowed and well-nigh broken by the cruel circumstances of their lives, then you say "Not only are you setting class against class "&#x2014;that, I may mention in passing, was the accusation you brought against Mr. Chamberlain twenty-five years ago&#x2014;" not only are you setting class against class, not only are you driving capital abroad, not only are you bringing ruin upon the country and the Empire," but worse than all, above all and beyond all, you say, "These men have faces like sausages, or, indeed, like suet puddings." These, my Lords, are the literal and sober truths of the methods of political controversy on the platform of those political purists on the Benches opposite.<lb/>
I would like to touch for one moment on the speech delivered on Wednesday night by the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery. I am one of those who bitterly regret the severance of the noble Earl from the Liberal Party. I remember the great services which he rendered to the Party in the past.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0613"/>
<col>1213</col>
I remember the brilliant attacks which, when we were in Opposition, he made inside and outside of this House on the Party to which he was then opposed. It was with great regret that I read the speech which the noble Earl delivered recently at Glasgow. He told us the other night that it was delivered in an atmosphere of some seventy-five degrees. I think that fact throws an entirely new light upon it. I can understand some passages in the speech better now than I could before, but how final and complete the severance of the noble Earl from this side was I did not actually realise until I heard him propounding a scheme whereby you could make the defeat which we are about to sustain in the Lobby carry increased weight in the minds of the electors of this country. He made a practical suggestion to your Lordships. He suggested that some 150 out of your number should be chosen&#x2014;150 out of, roughly, about 500&#x2014;to do battle against the other side. Well, I am not sure when the noble Earl made that suggestion whether he had perused a list which appeared in the <i>Standard</i> on Monday last which divided the members of your Lordships' House into various different categories. There were, for instance, Statesmen, Empire makers, diplomatists, railway directors, landowners, bankers, soldiers, educationalists, scientists, jurists, county workers and captains of industry. I perused this list with great interest and I only wish I had had more time in the last few days to devote to it, for it was really very instructive. Amongst the captains of industry, for example, I noticed the noble Earl, Lord Cowley. Lord Cowley, I gather from that list, is a "captain of industry." Then I noticed the name of my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale, whom I have known for a considerable number of years. He also figured in that list, I am bound to say rather to my surprise, as a "captain of industry." Then there was Lord Poulett, and really Lord Poulett is the most remarkable instance of them all. Lord Poulett, I think I am right in saying, is but twenty-six years of age, and yet during that short time, no doubt by honest toil and strenuous effort, he has reached this great position of a "captain of industry." That is all the more remarkable because I know for a fact that all this time, when he must have been toiling so strenuously in business and other ways, he was hunting a pack of harriers in Somersetshire with, I have no doubt, considerable <i>eclat</i>.<lb/>
<col>1214</col>
If the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition really did entertain the suggestion of Lord Rosebery I am bound to say he would find himself in a rather difficult position. Supposing he took, say, the Statesmen, the Empire makers, the captains of industry, the railway directors and the jurists, and I do not see how he could well leave out any of those, that gives him a total of 147. Subtracting out of that say thirty who might be Liberal Peers; that gives 117. Now, in the other categories I have mentioned, the diplomatists, soldiers, and so forth, there are somewhere about 300. Therefore he would be in the invidious position of having to choose thirty out of somewhere about 300 of these very distinguished men. Looking back to my rather vague knowledge of history I cannot think of any leader who has been in such a terribly perplexing position since possibly the days of Gideon, the son of Joash. Your Lordships may recollect that Gideon had to choose a few hundred men out of an army of 10,000 to do battle against the Midianites. The noble Marquess is in this respect in a far better position than Gideon, because he only has to choose some 150 out of 500, but, on the other hand, the task of the noble Marquess is in some respects more difficult than that of Gideon, and for this reason. I speak subject to the correction of any member of the right rev. Bench when I say I presume that Gideon had fewer Empire builders, or captains of industry, or railway directors, or county workers to choose from in his army of 10,000 men. No doubt your Lordships are very familiar with the procedure adopted by Gideon, but for the benefit of some captains of industry on the Benches opposite whose Biblical history may be a trifle rusty I may remind them exactly what it was that Gideon did. He was told to set aside "every one that lappeth the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth." May I, with great deference and respect, suggest to noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite that the precedent set by Gideon might be useful for the purpose of choosing champions to do battle with the Radical hosts, but, in consideration of the feelings of my opponents, might I also suggest that water should not be, the only beverage employed for the purpose.<lb/>
Another thing which I would like to mention, and which, I think, is nearly as important as any of the speeches that have been made by noble Lords opposite, is the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0614"/>
<col>1215</col>
absence during these debates of a distinguished member of this House&#x2014;the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. The absence of that noble Viscount is very remarkable. I understand that he is in London at the present time presiding over the Royal Commission dealing with land transfer. I would like to ask some member of the Opposition, any member who will deign to reply, why it is that Viscount St. Aldwyn has remained absent from these discussions? Hitherto he has taken part in every Budget debate that has been held in this House since this Government came into office. He is the only Ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer in this House. He is still quoted at the Treasury, and will be quoted for many a long year, as a great authority on national finance. Why, I repeat, is he absent from these discussions? Is it because the labours of this Royal Commission are so arduous, or is it rather because he is a great Parliamentarian and a great House of Commons man, and bitterly resents the course which noble Lords are taking with regard to the Finance Bill of this year?<lb/>
I only desire to offer one or two further observations with regard to this Budget. I would like to say one or two words as to the constitution of this House. The views I hold might be regarded in some quarters as extremely moderate and out-of-date: in other quarters they might be regarded as very extreme. I do not, for example, share the view of the schoolboy who was told to write an essay on Guy Fawkes, and who wrote that Guy Fawkes was, in his opinion, a very wise and clever man because he tried to blow up the House of Lords. But I do say this, that anything more unfair or unjust to a Liberal Government than the present state of affairs it is impossible to imagine. I cannot conceive of a more humiliating position than for men to be given positions of authority, with little, if any, real authority; to be given the semblance of power with little or no real power. That is the case; I am not speaking of the administrative duties of Ministers, but as regards the legislative duties of Liberal Ministers. I can understand to some extent the motives which have prompted noble Lords opposite to reject this Bill, and in all sincerity I say that I respect them for the courage they are showing. I have always respected fighting men, possibly because I am such a painfully peaceful person myself; but I
<col>1216</col>
do not envy them the position in which they are now placed. It is true, I believe that we, at the General Election, will be fighting for our very existence; fighting with our backs to the wall. It is true, on the other hand, that if you lose, the enormous power you now hold may be, to some extent curtailed; but if you win you will gain supreme power&#x2014;supreme over the Crown, supreme over the Commons; yes, the power supreme, unchecked, and uncontrolled. Noble Lords opposite jeer at that statement. Will any of them tell me what then, in their opinion, will be the issues on which the General Election will be fought, and will they consider themselves entitled to pass a Tariff Reform Budget should they be returned to power? They are forcing us to go to the country, and surely it is fair to the electors to tell us what they will do in the case of a victory for their side?<lb/>
I would like to quote what was said not long ago by Mr. Walter Long. He said that politics has become a war in this country between the Haves and the Have-nots. I do not think that is exactly the case. It is true that the bulk of the wealth of this country, or certainly the greater part of the wealth of this country, is on the side of noble Lords opposite, but there are on this side of the House some wealthy men, and there are many men of moderate means or men who have a modest competence and who are loyal supporters of the Liberal Government at the present time. Some of them, may be, are men who are engaged in the advocacy of some particular reform. It is easy to sneer at men like those as "faddists" and "cranks," and it is always easy to raise a cheer in this House whenever you choose to do so by those means. But those men, after all, are working wholeheartedly, loyally, for the cause they have at heart, and there are others who are working for the Liberal Party because they see in it the agency, and, as they believe, a powerful agency, for social reform, and who look to Liberalism to check some of the terrible evils which modern civilisation has brought in its train. Well, if you succeed in gaining supreme power, and if you retain supreme power for any length of time, a great number of those men will necessarily, so it seems to me, give up in despair, and then, indeed, politics in this country will become a bitter and a merciless struggle between the Haves and the Have-nots.

And should that come to pass, then depend upon it revolution will not be very far off&#x2014;not the rosewater revolution which you discern, or affect to discern, but revolution grim and stern and terrible as war itself. My Lords, I pray that that revolution may never come. But if ever we are threatened with revolution then I think there are some members of this House who will sigh regretfully for the days, the halcyon days, of 1909, when they had to deal with desperadoes fierce and cruel, like the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and Socialists of the type of my noble friend the Leader of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03663"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RITCHIE OF DUNDEE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was under the impression that we were discussing the Budget, but the great part of the noble Lord's speech was devoted to personalities. I am not going to make any attempt to defend noble Dukes&#x2014;first, because I think they are quite capable of defending themselves, and, secondly, because I do not see what it has to do with the Budget. The noble Lord who has just sat down asked us a riddle. The riddle was this&#x2014;" Where is Lord St. Aldwyn? "Well, I do not know where Lord St. Aldwyn is; but I will ask noble Lords opposite a riddle in return&#x2014;" Where is Lord Joicey?" I followed the Third Reading debate in another place pretty carefully, and I was very much struck by the fact that while the more timid supporters of the Government were trying to keep one another's spirits up by protesting that there was not the slightest taint of Socialism in this Bill, the Socialist supporters of the Government were congratulating one another on having obtained so very large and satisfactory an instalment of their most cherished principles. I think they were entirely justified in congratulating themselves, because in these land taxes they have obtained from the Government a recognition of the two root principles of a complete system of Socialism&#x2014;the principle of the redistribution of capital and the principle that increment is due to the action of the community and is therefore the property of the community. The Attorney-General, in the course of that debate, gave his definition of Socialism in these words&#x2014;
<quote>" Socialism is the substitution of cumbrous, ignorant and hide-bound State action for individual enterprise and energy."</quote>
If I had racked my brains for a month
<col>1218</col>
I do not think I could possibly have evolved a more perfect description of the general tenor of the Government's legislation during the last two or three years. Nearly every measure they have sent up to this House has provided for the substitution of cumbrous, ignorant, and hide-bound State action for individual enterprise and energy. Almost every measure they have sent up here has been the embodiment of bureaucracy and teaches the people the deplorable lesson that it is not so much upon their own individual efforts that they need rely any longer but that they may lean with confidence and security on the fostering care of an almighty Government. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, asked us whether we were afraid of the predatory instincts of the people. Well, I am not afraid of the predatory instincts of the people. I am afraid of the lessons which the legislation of the Government is teaching the people&#x2014;legislation which, as was inevitable, has been accompanied by a horrible growth of expenditure instead of the retrenchment which we were promised.<lb/>
Now, to crown it all, we are given a Budget containing principles which aim a further blow at private enterprise and attack capital as well. Capital is very shy and very easily frightened, and public enterprise will disappear if you deny it its fair reward. The supporters of the Government laugh us to scorn when we tell them that the working classes will be the first to feel the ill effects of the Budget. But capital is very much more liquid than labour, and capital can go elsewhere and leave labour behind. Socialists hold the view that capital gets too large a return in this country, and I should imagine that the authors of the Budget share this view. If that is the case, why is it that capital is leaving the country in unprecedented volume? Surely if capital got so good a return here it would not want to go elsewhere. Those who hold the view that capital gets too high a return in this country must surely realise that by attacking capital they are bringing about the very opposite result to that which they wish to achieve. Surely they must see that if they attack capital it results in the capitalist asking a higher return for his money than when his security is good. The man who is prepared to take three or four per cent. for his capital when the security is sound will want five or six
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0616"/>
<col>1219</col>
per cent. for it if you damage the security, or else he will take his capital elsewhere&#x2014;a process which the noble Lord, Lord Revelstoke, gave ample evidence is going on at the present moment. The noble Lord, Lord St. David's, the other evening told us that whenever any sound investment was offered in the City of London with good security there was plenty of capital forthcoming. Of course there is. Your Lordships do not want a financial expert from the City of London to tell them that self-evident proposition. The noble Lord was begging the question. Our point is that by damaging the security you are removing the attraction to capital. The first essential of a healthy labour market is an abundant supply of cheap capital, and if you threaten capital labour will feel the first effects. Pursue your policy a little farther, carry it to its logical conclusion, and your credit will go too.<lb/>
Let us consider what six or seven months of this Budget has done for the credit of the country. I have taken figures from the Stock Exchange lists in April last, before the Budget was introduced, and compared them with the figures ruling within the last few days. This is what I find. I find that whereas Consols have fallen over three per cent. Russian stock is unchanged, Japanese stock has gone up one per cent., and French Government stock one and a-half per cent. Then I have taken the best classes of English railway debentures. I find that Great Western Railway stock has fallen four and three-eighths per cent., and London and North Western debentures three and three-quarters per cent., while Canadian Pacific stock, on the other hand, has not moved, and the best class or American railway bonds has not moved. There is one country that I have not named&#x2014;Germany. Germany is the exception that proves the rule. German stock has fallen in exactly the same ratio as British stock, and I think the explanation is very simple. Germany is wallowing in the same financial morass as we are in, and from much the same causes&#x2014;growth of expenditure and the threat of Socialism. Why is it that during this time British securities have fallen while the securities of other countries have either remained steady or been inclined to rise? It cannot be owing to any peculiarity of the London money market, because many of the foreign stocks I have mentioned
<col>1220</col>
are dealt with very largely in London, some of them almost exclusively, so that if the money market had affected one class of stock it would have affected the other. No; there has been a steady pressure to sell British securities, and there has been some influence at work here which is non-existent elsewhere. I say without hesitation that that influence is a feeling of insecurity engendered by the growth of expenditure, by the policy of the Government in general, and by this Budget in particular. The trade of the country cries out for retrenchment and the lightening of the burden of taxation, and the reply it gets from a demented House of Commons is a wildcat scheme of land valuation at a cost according to the Government's own ridiculous estimate, of &#x00A3;2,000,000, but in the view of those who are well versed in these matters at a cost more like &#x00A3;10,000,000 or &#x00A3;12,000,000.<lb/>
I am a Free Trader, and I am told by the Government that I must take my choice between their policy, crystalised as it is in this Budget, and Tariff Reform. Well, I can name two measures for which the Government have been answerable in the last two months both of which violate the first principles of Free Trade&#x2014;the Port of London Act and that misbegotten Bill, the Hops Bill, No. 2. The latter Bill was greeted with such exuberant joy by Tariff Reformers on this side of the House that the Government have apparently thought it wise to hustle it off the stage in the hope that it may be forgotten. One or two noble Lords opposite who denounced the Bill as a betrayal of Free Trade are not likely to forget it in a hurry. It seems to me that the chief difference between the two Parties on this question of Tariff Reform, or Protection, or whatever else you like to call it, is that while one preaches it the other is busy practising it. And when I am told that I must take my choice between this Budget and Tariff Reform I have two replies. One is that the land taxes, to which, although I am not a landowner, I object more strongly than to any other part of the Budget, will bring in no revenue this year; and the other is that apparently I have got to submit to Tariff Reform in one shape or another whichever Party is in power, and I think, on the whole, I prefer to be experimented upon by my political friends rather than by my political
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0617"/>
<col>1221</col>
opponents. I do not want to make way for Tariff Reform. I should not be sorry to see Tariff Reform "side-tracked," or thrown off the track altogether; but much as I dislike Tariff Reform I dislike this Budget still more, because I believe it contains principles which aim a deadly blow at the very foundation upon which the prosperity of this country has been built&#x2014;the enterprise and the energy of the individual. Destroy that energy and enterprise, as you undoubtedly will if you carry these principles to a logical conclusion, and you will convert prosperity into ruin. I am going to vote for the Amendment of the noble Marquess because I think the people should have an opportunity of expressing their opinion on a Bill which to my mind is fraught with incalculable danger to the whole of the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03664"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is without doubt a Socialistic Budget, and I believe that it is brought in not so much with a view to obtaining the finance of the year as with the object of creating a quarrel with your Lordships' House, because so long as this House is in being and is a power it is quite impossible for any Government to carry on these Socialistic methods. The whole of the legislation of the last four years points to the efforts being made by Socialism to invade Parliament. We have seen in almost every measure the attempt to place the supreme power in the hands of a bureaucracy. What is that but the beginning of the thin end of the wedge of Socialism? In the course of this debate various noble Lords have spoken of revolution. Earl Russell appealed to the French Revolution, Earl Beauchamp appealed to the revolution which took place under the reign of the Stuarts, and now we have the noble Lord, Lord Denman, saying it is very possible that a revolution may take place as a consequence of what is going to occur in your Lordships' House. You must remember that if it does take place it will be a revolution by invitation. Members of the Government have been about London and other parts of the country appealing to the passions of some of the lowest classes in the country; and what can you expect? We all know that there is a certain substratum existing in society always ready, owing to poverty, crime, and other evils, to assist in disorder, especially when invited to do so by those who hold high office in His Majesty's Government. I
<col>1222</col>
think those who have appealed to such terrible measures must be responsible for anything that takes place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03665"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will allow me, may I point out that I only alluded to the French Revolution as an instance of the courage of an aristocracy and for no other purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03666"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say before I leave this subject that I was very glad to hear the Marquess of Northampton say that old age pensions were the product of both sides of the House, and that they would be carried on in the future by both sides of the House. I think that gives a conclusive answer to the statements which were made by the Lord Advocate, and which were so ably refuted by the Leader of the Opposition in the other House. After all, what is it that the Amendment of the noble Marquess proposes? What we propose is that before this Budget is passed into law it should be referred&#x2014;this most revolutionary Budget&#x2014;to the will of the people. We acknowledge the supremacy of the people, and we are perfectly ready to act on their dictum. But that is not at all what the Government are prepared to do. I should like to quote what the Lord Chancellor said the other day. He said&#x2014;
<quote>" It is in my opinion impossible that any Liberal Government should ever again bear the heavy burden of office unless it is secured against a repetition of treatment such as our measures have had to undergo for the last four years."</quote>
What does he do? He puts himself above the people. He refuses to abide by the decision of the people when that decision is adverse. I think that is also a very Socialistic proposal. Then Lord Rosebery says he would like to see the House of Lords pass this Finance Bill, not because he had a good opinion of it, but because he had such an excessively bad opinion of it. The noble Earl said that if the Budget were allowed to become law and if the country had a sufficient experience of its intolerable inquisitions, its intolerable bureaucracy and the enormous loss of employment and capital it must involve, we should achieve a victory when next we went to the polls. I think the noble Earl's speech was a most admirable criticism of the Bill, but I cannot accept his conclusion. He foresees the hardships which this Budget would entail upon the populace, the great loss of employment which it would bring in its wake, and
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0618"/>
<col>1223</col>
all the rest of the hardships and disasters which are to accompany it. And yet he says "Pass the Budget; let the people suffer; and then when they have suffered, when they have found out what tyranny and what an amount of pain and suffering and loss of employment this Budget has caused they will turn to the Unionist Party and say ' We will gladly have you back again.'" That is not, in my opinion, the right way to do the thing. Let us tell the people what the hardships are going to be. Let them know what the Budget is going to do for them. Then give them the opportunity of deciding and if they elect to have the Budget they cannot blame your Lordships' House. Lord Balfour of Burleigh made a most excellent speech and a most excellent criticism of the Budget, but his conclusion, again, is one which I think it is almost impossible to understand. He criticised the Budget. He showed what a bad and wicked Bill it is. He showed the difficulty of carrying out the details, the enormous expense it would involve before you could even understand the different clauses of the Bill; and yet he said that he could not vote for the Amendment and that he must go out into the woods. I confess that that is a conclusion I fail to understand. I can only say that all we Scottish Peers who have for many years watched the noble Lord's distinguished and able career can only view his action with surprise and great regret. I can only think that the idea that possessed him was that if this Budget were not passed it would be a death blow to what he valued still more&#x2014;Free Trade. Your Lordships must remember that the welfare of millions of your countrymen, the very life of the country, is in its industry, and that its industry depends on its integrity and on its security. The security of the people is in the integrity of their rulers; it is that integrity and that security which can alone bring about national prosperity and it is for that integrity and security that your Lordships are standing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03667"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KILLANIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the important matter before the House I should especially like to have an opportunity of expressing, however briefly, my view, because, while I agree with a great deal of the criticism&#x2014;I might perhaps say all the criticisms&#x2014;of the Budget offered on this side of the House, I am in the unfortunate position that I cannot see my way to voting for the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. We have
<col>1224</col>
heard in the course of this debate a number of very interesting and able speeches, and from this side of the House we have heard a number of powerful criticisms of the Budget; and, as an Irishman, I wish to take the opportunity of endorsing the view of the Budget expressed by two noble Lords from Ireland, Lord Donoughmore and Lord Ashbourne, who pointed out how particularly unfair this Budget is, in its incidence of taxation, on Irish interests by picking out for heavy taxation such well-known commodities of Irish life as whisky, tobacco, and land.<lb/>
But, though I have heard a great many speeches, and agree with many of these criticisms of the Budget, they have not for the most part assisted me in the difficulty which I feel in this matter, because the question that seems to me to be of primary importance in reference to how we treat it is the constitutional one. The noble Lord, Lord Newton, asked "What does that matter? What interest will the electorate take in the constitutional view?" That may be so; possibly the bulk of the electorate will not take any interest in it: heaven only knows what will influence them! But the constitutional aspect is very important for members of this House to take into careful consideration on this fateful occasion, and we ought not to put it aside in this easy, indifferent manner. Furthermore, a large number of electors, and those Conservative electors, do take an interest in the constitutional view of the question. My difficulty in the matter is that the Government come to this House and say, "This is the Finance Bill of the year, the annual Bill of Supplies and aids granted by the House of Commons; it has been passed, also, in that House by a majority of 230, and do you mean to say that the House of Lords is going to throw it out? We know that this House has the Tight to point out the unfairness of any of the taxes and to discuss and express disapproval of them, but we submit that it has no right to amend or reject such a Bill." As an abstract proposition&#x2014;if this were an ordinary Budget&#x2014;I should agree with the Government. But then a noble Lord on this side of the House says, "Do you mean to say you are going to vote for this particular measure just because it is called a Finance Bill?" to which, I reply, "Certainly not." That is the dilemma, the contradiction, the difficulty of the problem as it presents itself to me, and which I had hoped this House
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0619"/>
<col>1225</col>
might have found some means of coming to closer quarters with, and so clearing up, if not solving.<lb/>
May I attempt, then, to formulate my view? And, in the first place, may I say that, while I recognise that this House has the legal right to reject a Money Bill or a Finance Bill, I submit that in the case of an unwritten Constitution the mere letter of the law does not cover the whole ground or settle the question; and, from all I have heard or read on the subject, I am of opinion that it would be against the theory, and practice, and spirit of the Constitution and against all the principles and conventions which make and hold together our unwritten Constitution, if this House were to reject or amend the Budget, provided the particular measure, called a Finance Bill, is a genuine, annual Budget, and nothing more. I hold that, even if your Lordships considered certain financial proposals were "Socialistic" or "revolutionary," or were convinced that the finances of the nation could be better arranged, we must observe our constitutional limitations, and that, provided the Bill containing such proposals is a Finance Bill and nothing more than a Finance Bill, this House is bound to pass it, and that its assent to it with or without discussion is merely formal. But one does not get much further unless one considers what is a Finance Bill. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said that at the beginning of each session, the Sovereign in the speech from the Throne asks the "Gentlemen of the House of Commons" to grant Supplies and aids with which to carry on the executive Government of the year, and he implied, and I submit, that the Finance Bill is the response of the House of Commons to the request of the Sovereign made at the beginning of each year for Supplies and aids for the carrying on of the Government for that year.<lb/>
But this Finance Bill is much more, and includes under its cover important pieces of legislation. A couple of right rev. Prelates have supported this Bill on the express ground that it, is a great scheme of social reform. That has been the boast also of many members of the Government. That may be all very well, and in its time and place a good thing. I can quite understand the right rev. Prelates being earnest advocates of beneficial schemes of social reorganisation, but such measures and
<col>1226</col>
objects are, surely, legislation&#x0021;and it is intolerable that such great social changes should be brought about, and the Second Chamber, which is intended to revise all legislation, be able to do nothing with reference to them. Let us take the valuation clauses. I submit that these are a most serious and flagrant case of "tacking." The noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, has justified their inclusion in the Finance Bill as being a necessary accompaniment of the land taxes. But that does not settle the matter. I ask him, Is this House, or is it not, a Second Chamber for revising all legislation? And does he really maintain that such a Valuation Bill, introducing entirely new principles of valuation, is not legislation, or that it is right that it should become the law of the land, and yet this House never have been able to change a single, word in it or reject it, if it so thought right? My submission is&#x2014;not that I am necessarily opposed to such proposals&#x2014;that it is intolerable and absurd to think that such a piece of legislation might possibly become law, and this House have been absolutely debarred from considering it on its merits. Moreover, valuation Bills have always hitherto been regarded and treated as legislative proposals.<lb/>
Then take the Land Taxes. Here, again, there is tacking. They are sufficient to constitute a Land Bill, introducing, as they do, great changes in the ownership of landed property. Take the Undeveloped Land Duty. It practically compels urban landowners to deal with their property in a certain way. That is the cause and object of the tax, and, although it may be a good object, is it to become the law of the land and this House have had nothing whatever to say to it and to have been wholly unable to change a single syllable in it? And if I turn to the Licensing Clauses, I find the same story. They contain the penal policy advocated by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. They have openly said that their object, in connection with the Licensing Clauses, was not merely to raise money but to carry out a certain policy with reference to the liquor trade of the country. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has boasted that, as a result of the taxation, he looked forward to "diminishing" returns from this source of revenue. His real aim is to injure or destroy a certain trade. That may be a good thing, it may,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0620"/>
<col>1227</col>
or may not, deserve approbation, but I object most strongly to any such legislation being included in a Budget Bill and to this House being told that it has, therefore, no right to interfere with it at all. I say that it is intolerable that such obvious pieces of legislation as I have referred to should be thus smuggled through Parliament, and this House told that it cannot touch them just because they can be used, or, if you like, are even necessary, for financial purposes afterwards. That is the view which I hold very strongly and which I have held all along; and the speeches I have heard have not caused me to change my mind.<lb/>
Such is the difficulty of the situation as it strikes me. The real trouble and cause of complaint is "tacking"; and I thought it should have been met by frankly and openly dealing with it. It seemed to me a fitting occasion to repel a serious and growing invasion of our rights and privileges. It is admitted that tacking may not take place, but it is also said that we must not amend a Money Bill; but I could quote a number of authorities showing that, if there is a case of tacking to Money Bills, we have the right to amend on the ground of, and in so far as it is a case of, tacking. Members of the Government have boasted that they would tack to this Budget legislative measures which we had refused to pass by themselves; they have done so; and it seems to me that this House would have been better advised to have dealt with the matter from that standpoint. Those parts of the Finance Bill which were genuine financial proposals for the year would then have been passed by this House although it might not have thought well of them, and, on the other hand, the House would have been fully entitled to deal, as it thought fit, with those portions of the Bill which were tacking. If the rights and privileges of the House of Commons are invaded, the Speaker says so; he goes thoroughly into the matter, and the Commons confirm his rulings. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, being a member of the Government, could not fill that r&#x00F4;le for this House, but I venture to say that had a Committee of this House been appointed, composed of members who carried weight and were experienced in the working of the Constitution&#x2014;and from both sides of the House&#x2014;it could have inquired into whether certain portions of this Bill
<col>1228</col>
were not illegitimately tacked into it and were an invasion of the rights and privileges of this House as a legislative Chamber. Liberal and Conservative members of the House could have served on such a Committee, since afterwards any Peer could have voted, on their legislative merits, for or against any of the proposals which had been found as tacked on. I venture to think that some such treatment of the difficulties of the situation would have been profitable, and might possibly have led to some understanding or settlement, and at the worst, it could only have ended in a Dissolution, but the Dissolution would have been brought about by the other House, and not by this House; and this House, while it would not have failed to assert and protect all its rights and privileges, entrusted to it for the public good, would not, either, have exceeded them.<lb/>
That brings me to the reasons why the method proposed by the Amendment of the noble Marquess does not recommend itself to me. I cannot possibly vote for the Finance Bill in its present form, but neither can I support the Amendment of the noble Marquess because it seems to me to be a very extreme proposal&#x2014;more so than the case demands&#x2014;and because, as I have tried to show, I think it might have been dealt with otherwise. This House is going, without any attempt at discrimination, to refuse straight away all aids and supplies whatsoever to the Government, and thus bring the Executive to a deadlock. It arbitrarily orders a Dissolution and names the issue. We enact a Referendum off our own bat. These may be possible powers for us to exercise, and the Amendment has a plausible and democratic ring about it; but it seems to me to be very extreme action, and, whilst I am most anxious to protect the rights and privileges of this House, I think we are going unnecessarily far. Nor am I satisfied that it is the business of this House even to insist on the nation being consulted, except in accordance with the laws and customs of the Constitution. The late Lord Salisbury said that this House had not the power of changing the executive Government, but by this Amendment we are going to stop all Supplies and, necessarily, to turn out the Government by exercising a power and control which has hitherto rested solely and completely with the House of Commons. For these reasons I find it impossible to vote for the Amendment of the noble Marquess; and this is a
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0621"/>

matter of sincere regret to me, because I recognise the gravity of the occasion, and because during the eight years that I have been a member of this House I have always been able&#x2014;certainly on every important occasion&#x2014;to support the noble Marquess. I regret that I cannot do so now, all the more because I believe that I am as opposed as he is to much of the contents of the Bill, and because I am as opposed as possible to the procedure adopted by the Government in the introduction of this so-called Finance Bill to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03668"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say that I am supporting this Amendment, among other things, for the strong view I have always taken that the power of this House in such a matter is a necessity of the Constitution. It is admitted on all sides that this House has a legal right to reject a Money Bill, and I have always looked upon this as embodying the principle that we have for that reason the right to reject any Bill that may come before your Lordships' House. I consider that this is one of the greatest attributes a Second Chamber can possess and it is one of the greatest bulwarks of the rights of the Crown. I have always regarded it as an evil of a singles Chamber that there is nothing between it and the people when it is at variance with them except the veto of the Crown. I look upon the veto of the Crown us a delicate and sacred thing, which ought not to be used except in cases of the gravest emergency. It is far better if the House of Commons is to be called to account by the country that it should be done through the instrumentality of a Second Chamber than by the interposition of a powerful and popular Sovereign.<lb/>
Two things have always impressed me very much. There is the statue of the great Protector outside this House with his back to the Chamber he ruthlessly flaunted, and his face to the people to whom he appealed and in whose name he held sway for ten long years. The other is a point made by one of the Labour Members the other day. He said that a popular Sovereign was a greater danger to a democratic Government than a despot. I think this is sufficient to show that if this power is legal it is also constitutional in the sense that it is not obsolete and it is necessary. It is one we should preserve; but I can hardly see how it is to be preserved if it is to be whittled away by the indefinite wrapping up of
<col>1230</col>
almost any measure within the compass of a Finance Bill. The question before the House which has been stated on several occasions in the course of the debate is&#x2014;Are we justified in using this power on this occasion? I think we are. This is not an ordinary Finance Bill. It is a Bill which contains many new provisions of taxation, and I say that we are justified in rejecting it. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said the other night, for instance, that the valuation clauses were necessary to the taxation of land. Now, is it so? Is it not perfectly possible to take land on the present valuation if you want merely to raise taxes? Is not the whole gist of this Bill to substitute for an assessment based upon the annual value of the land an assessment based upon its capital value? This is a principle which has not hitherto been maintained in our system of taxation, and therefore we have the right to ask that the opinion and views of the nation may be taken upon this matter.<lb/>
Then, again, we are told openly that the whole object of this Bill is a revolution, that the purport of the Budget is a Socialistic one. This Budget was purposely formed so as to lead to the nationalisation of land, so as to lead to the nationalisation of the liquor trade, so as to lead to the nationalisation of the railways, and so as to lead to the nationalisation of all sources of production. The whole object of the Bill is Socialistic. There are three forms of Socialism. They take the form that every kind of property is to become the property of the State, and everybody is to be compelled to work, willingly if they will and compulsorily if they will not, for the benefit of the State; that the State shall take all liability to see that the people are fed, clothed, housed and made as happy as possible. That is a beautiful idea, but it is impracticable, and I know of only three instances in which it has come to fruition&#x2014;namely, the workhouse, the prison, and certain religious orders which have existed from time to time. The two first are not loved, and the third is impracticable except for enthusiasts and those prepared to banish all family ties. For these reasons I think it is absolutely necessary that we should exercise the power of this House in referring to the country a Bill which contains powers so novel and so far reaching, and whose acceptance must have the very gravest results upon the prosperity of this country.<lb/>

It is usual, and has always been the case in the past, to grant facilities for men to record their votes if they move from one station to another, as far as it is possible. Of course it is impossible to give these men any financial help in getting from one station to another, and the Treasury will not sanction any deviation from that rule.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FINANCE BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03681">Debate on the Amendment <i>moved</i> by the Marquess of Lansdowne to the Motion that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;viz., to leave out all the words after ("That") for the purpose of inserting the following Resolution ("This House is not justified in giving
<col>1234</col>
its consent to this Bill until it has been submitted to the judgment of the country")&#x2014;<i>resumed</i> according to order.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03682"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that I owe some apology to the House for venturing to address your Lordships for the first time on a subject so grave and an occasion so momentous. My diffidence is increased by the fact that I have felt compelled with great reluctance to take a position somewhat different from that which was so weightily indicated to your Lordships by the most rev. Primate the other day. I thought at the beginning of this debate, and I still think, that that position was one very proper and very dignified for the Bishops in this House to adopt, but since the debate began I have been compelled to think that, having been entrusted with a vote in this House on an occasion so important, I could not&#x2014;at least speaking for myself&#x2014;conscientiously refuse to give it, and that if I were to give it I should be compelled to give it against the Amendment of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
My Lords, I cannot describe myself in the words of the most rev. Primate as one of those who are honourably associated with Party ties. I stand apart from both Parties. I do not claim that as any credit, but simply as involved by the position which I hold, and the independence of that position may perhaps give some warrant for my speaking on this occasion. I can honestly say that no man could have approached this matter with a more open mind, and it is merely the course of your Lordships' debate which has convinced me that I have no other course but to join with those of your Lordships' House who deplore the Amendment of the noble Marquess. We have heard many able arguments to prove that this is a bad Budget. It is impossible to deny the weight of those arguments, urged as they have been by men of such wide experience in public affairs, in the management of land, and in the conduct of business. But I have not heard arguments sufficiently persuasive to prove that the Budget is bad enough to justify the unprecedented course which the noble Marquess has commended to this House. We cannot escape from the fact that this is an unprecedented course. Never before has this House rejected a Finance Bill sent up by an overwhelming majority from the other House; never before has it refused Supply
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0624"/>
<col>1235</col>
to the King's Government. Even in 1860 the Paper Duties Bill was only carried elsewhere by the small majority of nine. After all, it was only a single Bill involving not more than &#x00A3;3,000,000, and, therefore, it is not comparable with the course which the House is asked to take on this occasion.<lb/>
I shall, no doubt, be reminded that the Amendment of the noble Marquess does not ask the House to reject the Budget, but only to refer it to the country. But, my Lords, Amendments, like human beings, must be judged not by their intentions but by their performances&#x2014;not by what they say but by what they do&#x2014;and to refuse the Supplies for the year is to reject the Budget. There are signs&#x2014;not so much in what is being said in this House as in what is being said by those who support the noble Marquess in the country and in the Press&#x2014;that the weight of this contention&#x2014;that the course recommended is unparalleled&#x2014;does not heavily press upon their minds. There are indications of an attitude which says, "If this had never been done before it is high time it should be done now." I have been forcibly reminded of the familiar anecdote of the American traveller who, when he was shown a sacred lamp which had been burning for a thousand years, blew it out and quietly said, "Well, I guess it's out now."<lb/>
My Lords, precedent is the very basis of our Parliamentary system. It is the only bulwark which we possess against the encroachments of those sudden impulses, however strong and natural, which, if they were unchecked, would make the working of an unwritten Constitution impossible. But there is more here than precedent. There is surely a principle behind the precedent essential to the working of the Constitution. After the impressive speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord James of Hereford, yesterday it is needless to labour the greatness of the constitutional principle involved. Let me only use the words&#x2014;for none other summarise the position better&#x2014;of Lord Chatham&#x2014;
<quote>" In legislation the three estates of the realm are alike concerned, but the concurrence of the Peers and the Crown to taxes is only necessary to clothe it with the form of the law. The gift and grant is of the Commons alone. This distinction between legislation and taxation is essentially necessary to liberty."</quote>
There are some who think comparatively little interest is or will be taken in this constitutional question. Lord Newton in
<col>1236</col>
his entertaining speech said it was a subject of interest only to professors and dons and persons who write letters to the <i>Spectator</i>. I do not know much about the thoughts of these superior persons, but I do know something about the thoughts of the ordinary man, and I am much mistaken if it will not be proved that the constitutional question is one which not only interests but will profoundly stir the people of this country.<lb/>
There are many who have already said they would prefer the passing of a bad Budget which they dislike to any tampering with what they feel to be a fundamental principle of the Constitution. If, then, my Lords, the constitutional question is paramount, it is not enough, I will venture to urge, that the Budget should be grossly bad. Many Budgets have been described as bad&#x2014;I believe it was so in the case of the Budgets of 1853 and 1894. What would be the effect of establishing a precedent that if a Budget was sincerely, honestly, and with good reason disliked by this House it might therefore be rejected? It would mean either that this House was competent, apart from the prerogative of the Crown, to dissolve Parliament or that it would compel the Commons to make this grant not its own but one which would prove to be acceptable to this House. Such a contention would manifestly alter the whole balance of power upon which our Parliamentary system is based. Would it be too much to say that rejection is legitimate if only two things can be overwhelmingly demonstrated about this Bill&#x2014;first, that it is unconstitutional in method, and second, that it is revolutionary in its proposals?<lb/>
As for the first, that of course involves the question so-called of tacking. My Lords, that is a most serious question. Tacking is objected to because it also means an intrusion of legislation into the province of taxation. I do not think the principle could be better expressed than it was by your Lordships' House in 1702&#x2014;
<quote>"That the annexing of any clause or clauses to a Bill of aid or supply the matter of which is foreign to and different from the said Bill of aid or supply is unparliamentary and tends to the destruction of the Constitution."</quote>
I suppose we should add that equally illicit would be the re-introduction of any legislative measure in another form already rejected by this House. It is asserted, I
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0625"/>
<col>1237</col>
imagine, that the provisions of land valuation in this Bill involve tacking. But I ask myself are they foreign to the Bill? I am reminded that Mr. Mill, in a passage to which possibly I may refer again, in justifying the taxation of increment value, said&#x2014;
<quote>" The very first step to be taken would be a valuation of all the land in the country,"</quote>
I find it difficult to believe that procedure for the assessing of a tax is foreign to that tax itself. Again it has been argued with great ability that the duties on the liquor licences involve tacking, and that they bring in by a back door something which your Lordships have already dismissed. But is there any similarity between these duties and the Bill which was rejected? It is one thing to say, as the Bill did, that licences should be automatically reduced and that after the expiration of the time limit the State should resume the full control. It is not the same thing but a quite different thing to say that additional duties should be placed on the licences. My Lords, these duties may be wise or unwise&#x2014;that is a question which I am not competent to discuss; but can it be beyond the province of a Finance Bill to add to existing licence duties? The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, in a very forcible speech declared that if there was not a similarity in character between the two proceedings there was similarity in motive. That may be so, but I submit that in this context that is irrelevant. The question is not the motive with which something is done, but whether what is done is or is not constitutionally valid.<lb/>
Then, again, we have been assured that the Bill is revolutionary in its proposals. I presume that the criticism refers, not to the Income Tax or the Death Duties, but to the new Land Taxes. It is argued that there is gross unfairness in the incidence of the taxes, on the ground that land has been singled out for specially oppressive burdens. I think it was the noble Marquess, in the very impressive speech with which he moved his Amendment, who asked why the industry which deals with the products and the sale of the products of the land, already (as we all know) so seriously harassed, should be singled out for exceptional treatment. But, as I read this Bill, I find that the only direct way in which agricultural land is dealt with is by way of relief or exemption; and by Clause 69 it is exempted from some existing burdens,
<col>1238</col>
by Clause 7 it is exempted from the Increment Value Duty, by Clause 14 from the Reversion Duty, and by Clause 17 from the Undeveloped Land Duty. The new taxes, as I understand it, are not upon agricultural land, but on land which has acquired a special value from the fact that it is limited in amount, that it is needed by human beings to live upon, and that it acquires its value, not from the capital or labour of the owner, but from the labour and the expenditure of the community.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, urged that it was the vice of the Bill that capital was taxed out of all proportion to income. I imagine it is common ground that we should all wish to reach and make use of, to a larger extent than has hitherto been done, those large incomes to which no sort of responsibility is attached. But, as I read the Bill, the Super Tax in the Income Tax is a serious and earnest attempt to do this very thing. It may not be enough, it may not be the best plan, but at least the Bill, in burdening a special kind of land, also lays burdens upon a special kind of income. And noble Lords cannot say at one moment the Budget is bad because income is taxed too heavily, and at another moment say the Budget is bad because it is not taxed heavily enough. If we turn to the taxes themselves, it would be presumptuous upon my part to enter into them in any detail, but as a mere humble student of economics, I find it difficult to believe that a tax which, as long ago as 1848, received the special sanction of John Stuart Mill can be described as exceptionally revolutionary in its character.<lb/>
We have had recently reports from experts which have shown that the taxation of these increment values has come within the sphere of practical politics. The noble Lord, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, was amply justified in pointing out that he is responsible only for the suggestion that the amount of the increment value which is due to public expenditure, and that only, should be taxed. And other noble Lords are entitled to say that the suggestion has hitherto been that the contribution should go to the rates, and not the taxes. But at least it has been widely acknowledged that the time has come when additional burdens should be laid upon this special source of wealth, and I feel that words have somehow got out of relation with facts if the application
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0626"/>
<col>1239</col>
of that principle in the Bill is described as involving a revolution in finance. May I summarise the points which I have ventured to make? These proposals may be sound or unsound, they may be wise or unwise, but can they be described as unconstitutional in method, as revolutionary in character? And if they cannot be so described, do they merit the unparalleled treatment which the noble Marquess proposes to give them?<lb/>
I am aware that at this point another contention emerges. We are told that the danger is not so much in the actual proposals as in the tendency which lies behind them&#x2014;a tendency inferred from speeches delivered either by some of His Majesty's Ministers elsewhere or by some of their supporters. I hope I shall not be wanting in respect to a very eminent politician if I suggest that the tendency complained of is largely the tendency of the Celtic temperament to respond to its environment, to do a thing that meets the situation, to be conciliatory in the House of Commons and inflammatory at Limehouse. Partly the tendency may be that mysterious possession affecting the Celtic temperament which is called the <i>hwyl</i>, which makes the speaker say he knows not what, and excites the audience they know not why. But seriously one must say, I think, that a heavy responsibility has been incurred by those who have treated grave problems with a levity and a recklessness unworthy of their high position. We know what to think of those who run about in the midst of inflammable materials with crackers and squibs, and if a serious contest is provoked by the vote which will be taken this evening the whole responsibility cannot in justice be laid upon the shoulders of noble Lords who support the Amendment.<lb/>
But even if this be true these considerations would surely be valid in any general indictment of His Majesty's Government or at a General Election, but in this matter admittedly requiring the most scrupulous and delicate care, ought this House to go beyond what is contained within the covers of the Bill, and import into it inferences which are drawn from other sources? I think the reply would be made that the dangerous tendencies are within the covers of the Bill, that what is proposed is a first step to Socialistic legislation. It is our old friend, the thin-end-of-the-wedge argument. He has been very
<col>1240</col>
familiar in all the debates on social legislation which have taken place during the last fifty years. He was busy in opposing the Factory Acts, in opposing the extension of compulsory education, in opposing the protection of women and girls, in opposing the control of the hours of labour or of the sale of liquor or the regulation of sweated industries. His past appearances have somewhat discredited him, and I am not greatly alarmed by his appearance now.<lb/>
In this country it is a very far cry from the taxation of land values to that abstract and logical system of Socialism which was denounced by the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, with such impressive eloquence as&#x2014;
<quote>" the end of property, the end of the family, the end of religion, the end of all things."</quote>
May I say, without presumption, that I know as many as any member of this House of those who would be described perhaps as Socialists, and though I disagree fundamentally with many of their positions, I know many of them to be as devoted to the property they have, to their families and to their religion as any of your Lord-ships. But is it not possible to attach too much importance to phrases and resolutions? It is difficult for us here who have no difficulty about language to realise the glamour of language to another section of the community. They are men deficient in knowledge of history and of economics, deficient in training in public life, they find it difficult to embody their ideal in words or in concrete shape, and so the large promises and stimulating phrases of logical Socialism appeal to them, they applaud them, and they repeat them without very deeply understanding them. But when they touch some matter upon which our working men have special knowledge and experience, such, for example, if I mistake not, as the property of our large building societies and friendly societies, they can be trusted to take an independent line.<lb/>
Two things have to be remembered. One is that the English character, in whatever class we find it, is not prone to follow logic. The Marxian Socialist is logical; the full-blown Protectionist is logical; we may thank Providence the English people is not logical. The other thing to be remembered is that human affairs in general rarely follow the lines of logical anticipation. New circumstances occur which change the situation; proposals
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0627"/>
<col>1241</col>
which might be injurious to industry or social life in one generation are quite natural and harmless in another. There is another illustration which will appeal to some noble Lords opposite. The logic of the old Manchester School has proved to be a very bad prophet, and it is quite as bad in the direction of social legislation as many of your Lordships would think it has been in the matter of Free Trade. The fact is that, not so much by argument as by one of those general influences which we call the spirit of the times, we have been led to take a higher conception of the functions of the State, and we believe&#x2014;we all believe, both sides of this House believe&#x2014;that there is a great place for the collective action of the community in extending the opportunities, especially of its weakest and most ignorant citizens, of living a decent life. It was a wise man who wrote&#x2014;
<quote>" Energy and self-dependence are liable to be impaired by the absence of help as much as by its excess. It is even more fatal to exertion to have no hope of succeeding by it than to be assured of succeeding without it."</quote>
I do not believe that there can be any doubt of the need of collective resources to give many individuals in this country the standing ground for a chance.<lb/>
Will this mean that when granted this they will demand more? I believe it will have the reverse effect. It is in an atmosphere of hopelessness and resentment against the social conditions existing that the extreme and bitter Socialism we all deplore is engendered and flourishes. Give a man a better chance, give him a feeling that the social system is not against him but with him, for him, and on his side, and then his own individual instincts of energy and enterprise will, I believe, be a more effectual check against the developments of Socialism than all the arguments that could be urged against it by more fortunate persons. As for the great bulk of skilled workmen, it is to their moral rather than to their political feelings that Socialism makes its appeal. There is among them a spirit of real comradeship in their desire to increase the opportunities and improve the conditions of their fellows. It is surely the truest wisdom to approach this social instinct on its moral side, so true and stimulating with sympathy, to train, to guide, to instruct it on the side where it is weak, in knowledge of history and economics. The truest wisdom is not to
<col>1242</col>
alienate, to embitter, to make it wilfully resentful and aggressive by using words about Socialism of mere indiscriminate dislike or panic. The moral, I think, is, we are entitled to consider proposals on their own merits and not to be too eager to import into the consideration of them fears of the consequences to which, were it not for good sense and circumstances, they might conceivably lead.<lb/>
Returning to my main theme, I ask&#x2014;Is this Bill, however open to objection, properly described as unconstitutional or revolutionary? Are we not in danger of attaching undue importance to words used elsewhere or tendencies suspected? If that is so, is the course proposed by the noble Marquess justified by facts? I have but a few closing words about the issues involved. It is foolish to use the language of threats in this House. Such language rightly arouses the spirit of men to whom threats are addressed. It is the voice not of threats, but of reason, which asks men seriously to weight the consequences of their action. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery) described the spirit of the Balaklava charge&#x2014;
<quote>" Theirs not to reason why,</quote>
<quote>Theirs but to do and die,"</quote>
but it is ours to reason why; it is for that object this debate has been carried on for six days, and if we reason I cannot but think we shall tremble at the consequences that may result from our action.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, with his wonted courage asks us to consider whether, if the right to reject a Finance Bill is not asserted now, it can ever be claimed again. The right remains; it is inherent in the law and the Constitution. But there is another right that is jeopardised by the Amendment of the noble Marquess&#x2014;a right more unquestioned, more important&#x2014;the right of this House to control not taxation but legislation. There is a handwriting on the wall that the time is coming, if it has not come, when the whole position of a Second Chamber in the Constitution of this country will be submitted to the judgment of the people. No issue can be of greater importance to the country than the result of that submission. There never was a time when there was greater need for a strong Second Chamber. Would not the weight with which this House would approach that discussion be infinitely greater if proof had been given&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0628"/>
<col>1243</col>
a proof the more impressive because it was against the interests and inclination of this House&#x2014;that in defending its privileges in legislation, it was scrupulously careful not to trench in the matter of taxation upon the privileges of the people?<lb/>
There is a courage which is eager to accept attack, and there is another, a harder, a higher courage which holds the hand until the attack can be met on the surest and strongest ground. I cannot but feel though it is not much use being a gloomy prophet that the effect of the Amendment if carried will not only be gravely to endanger the claim of this House to control legislation, but also that it will be to disturb, it may be for a long time, that balance of the estates of the realm on which the orderly government of this country depends. It would mean, would it not? dislocation of trade and commerce, which certainly would not allay, but might increase, those tendencies to which noble Lords have so impressively referred. It would mean most of all the postponement for a long time of those social reforms noble Lords on both sides of the House ardently desire. These risks, my Lords, are hovering over this House. Is it wise by the summons of the noble Marquess's Amendment to challenge them now? I am aware I have taxed the indulgence of your Lordships. It is a somewhat thankless task to occupy a middle path. I have not ventured to praise this Budget; that is not my province; it would be futile; we have "come to bury C&#x00E6;sar, not to praise him." To-night the decks will be cleared for action and the battle will begin. It may be that there are still some noble Lords opposite to whose unspoken but very real thoughts I venture to appeal. This is an issue in which there is no place for doubt; but if there be a doubt, the benefit of it should be given, not to the claims of Party, however strong, but to the permanent interests of this House and the spirit of the Constitution entrusted to its care.</membercontribution></p>

I will, in the observations that I have to address to the House, endeavour to make quite clear to your Lordships the reason why we are putting forward, and why we are supporting with perfect confidence in our own integrity and in the clearness of the issues, the Amendment of the noble Marquess, and why it is that we appeal without alarm to those with whom the decision will rest.<lb/>
Had I been able to address your Lord-ships as I contemplated on Thursday last I should have ventured to place before you certain remarks on the character and consequences of this Bill, but I realise that to do so at this stage of the debate would only be the flogging of the deadest of dead horses, and if I entered upon the task I should be merely saying again what has been better said by more competent speakers. There are only two points in the Budget itself to which I desire to refer before passing on to other topics, and in doing so I must ask the indulgence of the House if I do not find myself physically quite equal to the strain which I am about to undertake. The first point is the suggestion, which has found favour in some quarters of the House, that this Budget ought to be accepted as an instrument of social reform. I am not certain that this claim does not give away the Budget as a purely financial measure. But let that pass. The view I am stating was urged with great force by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack on the first night of the debate; it has found particular and perhaps natural favour wth the Episcopal Bench, although it did not figure very largely in the speech of the Archbishop to which we have just listened, and it was defended in a powerful speech the other night by the noble Earl opposite, Lord Russell.<lb/>
All these noble Lords have pointed to the evils with which we are so well acquainted in our social system&#x2014;evils arising from drunkenness, overcrowding, sweating, insanity, poverty, and crime, and they have said, "Let us accept this Budget, which, after all, gives us very large sums of money some of which maybe devoted to the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0629"/>
<col>1245</col>
alleviation of certain of those ills." I greatly deprecate the idea that regard for the social welfare of the people, or abhorrence of these social evils, is the monopoly of either side of your Lordships' House. I do not say that this has been so much as suggested, but the argument that this Bill is required and is necessary for the purpose of social amelioration certainly seems to throw upon those who cannot accept it the suspicion of some indifference to the conditions I have described. If that be so, I venture to say it would be a most unfair and most unjust imputation. For my part I regard the social problem, by which I mean the progressive deterioration of our people, as the most insistent political problem of to-day. It is a problem which as time advances will be found more and more to make and unmake Ministries.<lb/>
Indeed, if I were allowed to cast my glance over the whole political situation in its broadest aspects, I would say that there are two questions which pre-eminently demand the attention of our people. The first is the question of national defence&#x2014;namely, the question whether the nation is safe. The second is the question of social reform&#x2014;namely, whether the people are sound. But to argue that, because we possess a keen sense of these evils we are therefore bound to support any Budget by which large sums of money are raised is not only a dangerous but a profoundly immoral doctrine. It has been even urged in this debate that, although some of these taxes may be harsh and oppressive in their operation, yet, nevertheless, their objects are so good that your Lordships should assent to them. That is the old argument of the casuist with which we are all familiar from the dawn of time, that "the end justifies the means," which has been the parent of more social crimes in history than even vice itself.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I object to this argument not only because it is immoral. I object to it because it is also unsound. I do not believe that at any time in history poverty, or the consequences attendant upon poverty, have ever been mitigated by taxation or the products of taxation. If you pass this Budget we at any rate on this side of the House do not think you are going to have a happier or a more moral people. On the contrary, we think that there will be more unemployment, more distress, a lowering
<col>1246</col>
and not a raising of the social standard all round. It is for these reasons that we on this side of the House do not regard this Budget as an instrument of social regeneration. Rather do we think that the principles upon which it rests must lead to social demoralisation among the people. I only make these remarks in passing because in the course of these debates I have greatly resented the implication that on this side of the House there is any indifference to these social questions, and because it is in the very interests of the social welfare of the people that we intend to vote against this Budget, just as noble Lords opposite propose to vote for it.<lb/>
The second point about this Budget to which I ask your Lordships' permission to refer is this: I doubt whether sufficient importance has been given during the debate to the social concomitants of the Budget and to its financial sequel. By the social concomitants I mean the vexation of constant and unavoidable appeals to the Law Courts, and the almost intolerable inquisition into the life and property and economy of every person in this country who has property in any form&#x2014;an even more intolerable burden than the taxation itself. If you pass this Budget into law, you will be setting a veritable Old Man of the Sea upon the shoulders, not of your Lordships alone, but of all the respectable and reputable classes in the community. When I speak of the financial sequel of the Bill, I mean the certainty that the taxes which you are about to impose will not be fixed or stationary taxes, but will be taxes that will grow, and grow in a manner and with a rapidity which it would be quite impossible for your Lordships or anybody else to arrest. This has been openly admitted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We all know he would never have set up this great system of land valuation&#x2014;costing at the lowest estimate several millions&#x2014;for the mere paltry return from the land taxes which it is proposed to collect in the first or the second year. The candid and invaluable Mr. Ure has told us that these taxes in a few years time are to produce many millions sterling. It is not the mere prospect of the increase of these taxes which is the serious thing; it is the fact that you are now for the first time adopting the revolutionary principle of levying these taxes on capital value and not upon the income received. Once you make that start there is no difference in
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0630"/>
<col>1247</col>
principle whatever between &#x00BD; <i>d</i>. in the pound and 5<i>s</i>. or 10<i>s</i>. in the pound. It is only a step forward from partial and sporadic confiscation to complete and uniform confiscation.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham, whom I see there, commended these taxes to us on the ground that they are merely an extension of existing imposts, and that in the future they will "slowly broaden down from precedent to precedent." I confess I was not captivated or even greatly consoled by the prospects offered to us in the poetic imagery of the right rev. Prelate. In my view the growth of these taxes will be rapid and not slow, and the progress will be, not from precedent to precedent, but from privation to plunder. The right rev. Prelate is a great scholar, and I should like to remind him of an analogy with which he is no doubt familiar. When the Emperor Augustus was reorganising the Roman Empire, like His Majesty's Government he had a very ambitious programme, and, like them, he was greatly in need of money. Wiser than His Majesty's Government, he introduced a Customs tariff the duties under which varied from two and a-half to twelve per cent., with higher taxes on luxuries, and preferential treatment for the colonies of the Roman Empire. Like His Majesty's Government also he had great ideas about a new army, although I may say, in passing, that he did not commence to constitute it by depleting the old. In order to get his new army he introduced a scheme of death duties, of which we learn from the famous historian of the Roman Empire that in the course of two or three generations the whole of the property of the subject must have gradually passed through the coffers of the State. And then when the Senate, which corresponded to your Lordships' House, rebelled against all these impositions the Emperor regretfully informed them that unless they withdrew their objections he should be obliged to impose a special land tax.<lb/>
What was the sequel to these operations? At a later date another Emperor arose, whose name was Caracalla, much in the same way as in this country we might have another Prime Minister, who might even be the present President of the Board of Trade. We read this in the immortal pages of Gibbon concerning this Emperor:
<col>1248</col>
<quote>" Nor was the rapacious son of Severus contented with such a measure of taxation as had appeared sufficient to his moderate predecessors. Instead of one-twentieth part, he exacted one-tenth part of all legacies and inheritances, and during his reign he crushed alike every part of the Empire under the weight of his iron sceptre."</quote>
That is the way in which "The People's Budget" of Rome&#x2014;for so I am sure it was called&#x2014;" slowly broadened down from precedent to precedent," and I have no doubt we should have very much the same experience in this country.<lb/>
With your Lordships' permission I now desire to pass to the subject of this debate itself. I hope that it has at least dispelled one illusion, and that is the idea which has been so sedulously propagated in the Press that the Amendment which the noble Marquess has moved is not the result of his independent initiative, but is the consequence of pressure which has been exercised upon him by a number of your Lordships whom it is the fashion to describe by an invidious name. You are alleged to have come up from your residences in the country and to have forced the noble Marquess out of the action which his naturally cautious and constitutional temperament would have led him to take, and driven him into headlong and unconstitutional procedure. In some papers I have even seen Lord Milner and myself, probably because of our foreign experience, described as the leaders of this unruly foray. This makes a very good story. It rather reminds one of the Lord Advocate at his best. There is the same vivid imagination, cultivated by assiduous practice, and impervious to correction or control. The only drawback to the story is that there is not a word of truth in it. It is not to be imagined that the action of my noble friend Lord Lansdowne was taken without full and anxious consideration, or without consultation with all those with whom he is in the habit of acting, or without a deep consciousness of the enormous gravity of the issues. But at no stage has there been any difference of opinion between the noble Marquess and the great majority of those whom he leads with so much ability and with such unquestioned acceptance. Neither party has been called upon to bring any influence or any pressure upon the other, and, as this debate has shown and as the Division will show, there has rarely been an occasion in the history of your Lordships' House when there has been a greater unity
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0631"/>
<col>1249</col>
of opinion on the part of those who will constitute the majority in the Lobby.<lb/>
This unity has nor been altogether un-broken. We have had on this side of the House four or five speeches made by noble Lords of the highest eminence, to whose opinions we attach the greatest weight, who have all advocated an opposite course. Paradoxical as it may seem, if we want the most searching and crushing exposure of the faults and fallacies of the Budget it is to those speeches that we must turn. Nevertheless each of these noble Lords, with one exception, has ended with the remarkable, although I doubt not reluctant, conclusion that he could not himself vote for this Amendment. Now, my Lords, I should be ashamed to impugn in the smallest degree the absolute sincerity and intense conviction of these speakers. Their character, their career, and their reputation in this House and elsewhere would be a sufficient rebuke to any such unworthy slander. We have listened to them with the respect which their utterances always command, and yet, my Lords, ready as we are to follow these noble Lords on ordinary occasions I am confident that I am stating the attitude of the great majority of your Lordships' House when I say that their arguments on this occasion have left us absolutely unmoved, and that just as readily as we accept their premises with regard to the Budget, so do we repudiate the conclusions to which those premises have led, and that we think the action they have recommended to us is an action inconsistent with our own duty and with the honour of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The first of these speakers&#x2014;I am afraid he is not in his place to-day&#x2014;was Lord Cromer. I desire to speak very briefly of I his argument, to which, nevertheless, the greatest weight attaches. The reason of the noble Earl for not voting against the Bill was that he is apprehensive of an acute and prolonged constitutional controversy, which might divert the country from the supreme necessity of national defence. Your Lordships will know the importance that the noble Earl attaches to this subject. It figured in his speech on old age pensions last year. For my own part I agree with, indeed I go beyond, the noble Earl in my opinion about the extreme inadequacy of our existing system of national defence. But I cannot see what that has to do with the provisions of the
<col>1250</col>
present Budget. No part of the taxation under this Budget goes to national defence. That is a subject which, in our opinion, at any rate, has no very great interest for His Majesty's Ministers. If we pass this Bill we get no more Dreadnoughts, no better or superior Army than that which we have at present. On the contrary, there is every reason to anticipate that the money raised by this Budget will be dissipated on objects which, whether they be good or whether they be bad, will have no connection whatever with national defence. Indeed, I think it might be argued that the best and only way in which really to promote the cause of national defence would be to afford the country an opportunity as soon as possible of dispensing with His Majesty's present advisers.<lb/>
But, my Lords, if we pass this Bill shall we escape the constitutional controversy which Lord Cromer fears? Are we not committed to it in any case? Is it not certain that, whether you vote "Yes" or "No" on this Budget, the issue of the House of Lords is going to be the prominent issue of the next General Election? We had a Cabinet Minister, not the least shrewd and capable of that body, Mr. Lewis Harcourt, telling us a few months ago that it was going to be the leading plank of the Liberal platform. Of course it may be said that over and over again His Majesty's Government have marched with trumpets blowing up to the walls and have gone back again. That may be true, but there was a very significant passage in the speech of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack the other evening which I am surprised has not attracted more attention in this debate. It was the passage in which the noble and learned Lord, taking a piece of paper in his hand, in tones of extreme gravity, almost as though he had the black cap on his head, read out to your Lordships' House the record of our offences and the sentence of our impending doom. It was not for our prospective treatment of the Budget exclusively or alone that we are going to be punished, but for our alleged treatment of Liberal measures in general during the past four years.<lb/>
It is quite true that during the past few days we have passed the Irish Land Bill and the Housing and Town Planning Bill into law. All the credit for these measures&#x2014;and I am sure that I am not anxious to take it away&#x2014;is, of course, given to Mr.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0632"/>
<col>1251</col>
Birrell and Mr. Burns. No part of the credit can be allowed to rest with this House. We know only too well that if we pass a Liberal measure it is attributed to our calculating cowardice, and if we reject it it is all due to our insolent and inherited bravado. But, whatever may be the case about these particular Bills, the point of the Lord Chancellor was that it was because we have thrown out the Education Bill and the Licensing Bill, and the various other ingenious political and social experiments that we have had during the past four years, that we are going to be punished. Therefore, if we act on Lord Cromer's advice it is quite clear that we shall not escape from this constitutional struggle. The rod is in pickle for us anyhow. There are even some astute tacticians on the other side who, I believe, are of opinion that His Majesty's Government, if this Budget were accepted, would nevertheless dissolve immediately, and for my own part I think there would be a good deal to be said for such tactics, because His Majesty's Government would be able to go to the country and say that we had accepted defeat in the first encounter, and that they entered the lists with a victory in the opening round. Therefore it seems to me that if we were to follow the advice of Lord Cromer we should neither escape the constitutional controversy which he fears nor should we promote the cause of national defence which he has at heart.<lb/>
My Lords, there was a speech delivered a night of two ago&#x2014;and I wish I had heard it&#x2014;by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh, who although he spoke, as I am told, with great sincerity and fervour and said that he personally disliked the Bill, describing it as unfair between man and man and as based on class hatred and jealousy, nevertheless intimated his intention, when the Division arrived, to run away to the woods and not to be here to vote. There were two reasons which he urged for this course. The first, which he argued with great force&#x2014;and he was followed by Lord James of Hereford last night&#x2014;was the belief that your Lordships' House are for the first time instituting a great change in the practice and working of the Constitution of the country. That is a very serious statement and one to which I will, with your Lordships' permission, return in a few moments. The second reason was that the rejection of this Bill is bound up with the
<col>1252</col>
advocacy of Tariff Reform. I shall perhaps not be doing the noble Lord an injustice if I assume that that was the determining factor in his mind. It is quite true that a great many of your Lordships will vote against the Bill because you think that there is a better means of raising the money and I cannot see that you are to be blamed for that, because the conclusion of almost every speech that we hear from that side of the House is this&#x2014;" If you object to our taxes, what is the alternative by which you propose to raise the money? "No doubt these views will be urged with great power and force at the General Election, but I should have thought that it ought to be possible to give a vote against this Bill without any reference to Tariff Reform, and that the most ardent Free Trader could have given such a vote, if convinced of the immorality of the Budget, without expressing any judgment on the alternative proposals that may be urged in its place.<lb/>
Then I read this morning the speech of Lord James of Hereford. There is one passage in it which is so inconsistent with the course of the debate that I may, perhaps, be permitted to call attention to it. Speaking with his great authority as a constitutional lawyer he said that he concurred with the doctrine with regard to "tacking," but that that did not arise here, for the Opposition did not object to the Bill on the ground of "tacking." Surely this is a misrepresentation of the facts, for the noble Marquess, in his opening speech, elaborated in a most clear and distinct constitutional argument that it is in the main because there have been introduced into this Bill measures which have been withdrawn from the notice of your Lordships' House, which ought in the ordinary course to have come up as separate Bills, part of which have indeed come up as separate Bills, and been rejected by you in the last year or two, that objection is taken to this Bill. There was another passage in his speech to which I may be allowed to refer. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"In the conflict which is going to take place none of your Lordships will be able to take a share; not one of your Lordships will be able to defend the course you have taken; not one of your Lordships will be able to say that you have been acting in your belief within the Constitution."</quote>
My Lords, I respectfully dispute the whole of these propositions. Speaking for myself, at any rate, if I have the health, I propose to do every one of the things of which the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0633"/>
<col>1253</col>
noble Lord has declared your Lordships to be incapable. Anxious as the noble Lord appears to be to circumscribe the rights of this House, he cannot prevent your Lordships from appearing, at any rate until the issue of the writs, upon any platform in this country, and I hope that the large majority of your Lordships have no intention whatever to allow yourselves to be tried and sentenced unheard. I hope that you will take advantage of the occasions presented to you, and that on many a platform you will state at public meetings your belief that you have acted both within the spirit and the letter of the Constitution, and will explain the reasons for which you have voted against this Bill.<lb/>
And now, my Lords, I should like to say a few words about the notable speech to which we listened from Lord Rosebery. I am very sorry that the noble Earl is not in his place, but I hope that I am not thereby disabled from alluding to a speech which was certainly one of the most prominent incidents in this debate. It would be idle to deny that no speech was looked forward to with more interest than that of the noble Earl, partly on account of his own personality and partly from the fact that he had already entered the lists at Glasgow, where he made a great speech in which he delivered the first blow, and as many of us thought a smashing blow, in this campaign, which we were anxious to see whether the noble Earl would drive home in your Lordships' House, I rather wonder if the noble Earl quite sufficiently realised the great responsibility that he assumed when he spoke at Glasgow. When he came out on the platform at the City Hall and made that speech he was not a recluse thinking a lord in his study, but he was an ex-Prime Minister speaking a lord to his countrymen. I think a very great and natural importance attached to that speech. The noble Earl himself attached importance to it because he issued it with a, preface and scattered it broadcast in hundreds of thousands of copies throughout the country.<lb/>
No speech in my time has had anything like the instantaneous and overwhelming effect upon the people. If it did not originate the agitation against this Bill, at any rate it lent a great impetus to it. I have no doubt it must have had a profound impression on the judgment of your Lordships. It was the first speech that
<col>1254</col>
laid down in clear-cut and dramatic fashion the tremendous issues that were at stake. I need not read extracts from that speech. But when the noble Earl said that this Budget was putting the future of Great Britain in the melting pot, and that it was a revolution without any mandate from the people, the average man was surely justified in thinking that he ought to do what lay in his power to prevent such a catastrophe, or at least to secure that the revolution, if consummated, should be a revolution with a mandate and not without one. And when the noble Earl told his audience that in his belief it was not in the best interests of the nation that this financial measure should become law, again the average reader, particularly if he happened to be a legislator, might be pardoned for thinking that it was his duty to do what he could to prevent it. It is quite true that the noble Earl did not end with the advice that your Lordships should throw out this Bill. All he said, in respect of advice for the future, was that it would be well if a fortnight should elapse between the departure of the Bill from the other House and its arrival here. That interval took place, and I have no doubt that your Lordships devoted it to an examination of the measure. But I think the modesty of the noble Earl rather prevented him from seeing that there was another piece of literature, a more attractive and fascinating production, which would be more likely to be in your Lordships' hands during that fortnight than the crabbed and repulsive contents of the Finance Bill itself, and that was the speech which the noble Earl himself delivered at Glasgow. Those of us who have had any experience of study know well the delight with which we turn from an original text to the comments of a brilliant critic, and the noble Earl had no right to be surprised if the skill of the commentator on this occasion had even more weight than much of the contents of the original document itself. It was in some such frame of mind that we came here and awaited the advice of the noble Earl. We had again a denunciation of the Budget. This time it was a miasma or fog, which was overspreading the country and poisoning the sources of national prosperity. But this time the noble Earl concluded with the definite advice that for certain reasons which he gave it was our business to pass this measure into law.<lb/>
I desire to speak with profound respect
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0634"/>
<col>1255</col>
of the noble Earl's conclusion, and yet I venture to state that I am speaking the sentiments of the majority of those I am addressing when I say that we regarded the conclusion of the noble Earl as a lame and impotent conclusion, and that the impression produced upon us was as though some great and famous commander had left us in the breach after he himself had taken us up to the walls and had fired the powder in the train. I hope that I do no injustice to the motives of the noble Earl. They were motives of the highest patriotism and honour. The noble Earl said he had been for forty years a member of your Lordships' House. He has been its leader and he is still its foremost orator. He has on more than one occasion endeavoured to reform if, and therein I am his humble follower. No one could hear him without feeling that he is intensely concerned for the future of this House, that he thinks its continued existence vital to the welfare of the country, and that he fears your Lordships are going to incur grave peril if you persist in this course.<lb/>
I will not venture to attempt a comparison between the dangers of the revolution <i>in esse</i> and the revolution <i>in posse</i>&#x2014;the revolution involved in the plunge into Socialism of this Bill and the revolution that may be caused by any disturbance in the constitution of your House. But accepting the fact, as I think we all do here, that your Lordships, in taking this step, are incurring, if you like, considerable and grave risk, I should yet like to state the reasons why we have felt compelled to take the course we do. When we assembled in this House a week ago, what were the courses open to us? They were, as I think, only three in number. The first was to amend the Bill, not of course by tinkering it, in Committee fashion, but by the excision of such portions of it as in the public interest we thought desirable. The second was to accept the Bill <i>in toto</i>. The third was to reject or refer it to the people. The only noble Lord who, so far as I know, has advocated the first course is Lord Avebury, but I think he would be the first to recognise the practical impossibility of the course suggested, because, as a matter of fact, it would have raised at once the question of privilege. If you had sent down the Bill to the Commons amended or cut about they would have returned it to you with your excisions or Amendments
<col>1256</col>
ignored, and you would then have had either to swallow the Bill as a whole, with the additional humiliation of having attempted to alter it, or you would have had to reject it, which would have brought you to the present position of affairs. Therefore I rule aside that course as impracticable.<lb/>
The second course was to follow the advice of Lord Rosebery&#x2014;namely, to make very strong speeches against the Bill, but either to vote for it or to abstain from voting. The chief reasons, as I under-stand, advanced for this course are tactical in character and were summarised by the noble Earl. He thought it would be a good thing that the people of this country should be given six or eight months of experience of the Bill, of, as he expressed it, its intolerable inquisition, its intolerable bureaucracy, of the enormous loss of employment it would entail, and at the end of that time he believed that the country would give us a majority that would surprise ourselves. But I am not sure that we could have counted even upon six or eight months. It is just possible that noble Lords opposite might have been as much afraid of those six or eight months as the noble Earl is confident about them. It is at least conceivable that a General Election might have been sprung upon us before these lessons had sunk deep down into the hearts of the people. Then there is the question whether the effects of taxes like these could be correctly estimated in six or eight months. Remember, my Lords, that this is a Bill not merely for the imposition of taxes, but for the creation of machinery. Lord Rosebery described as an intolerable bureaucracy the system which is going to be set up. There are many noble Lords in this House who have had experience of administration greater than mine, but I think they will all concur with me in saying that nothing is more difficult than to disestablish a bureaucracy when once it has been enthroned. Posts are created, vested interests start into being, persons are appointed, salaries are paid, a whole network of organisation is instituted which it is almost impossible, after a few months have passed, to cleave asunder or to cut down.<lb/>
But there was another alternative put before us by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. He defined the period for which His Majesty's Government might
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0635"/>
<col>1257</col>
regard themselves as indispensable to the nation, not as six or eight months, but as two years. My Lords, I heard that prognostication from the noble and learned Lord with an absolute gasp of horror. But if it be true, I wonder whether Lord Rosebery would have contemplated that the people of this country should be left for two more years, not merely under the miasma of this Budget, but under the even more mephitic exhalations that might be supposed to emanate from its successor or its two successors, as well as all the other consequences which he depicted in such graphic terms.<lb/>
And these consequences would not be confined to the sphere of taxation. They would extend over the whole range of government. It would have been two more years, as we think, of insufficient attention to the defences of the country, two more years of Socialistic experiments, two more years of tampering with the Church and other of our national institutions. Had we acted on this advice, my Lords, I think it would have been, if I may use a metaphor the origin of which I do not know, but which is at least expressive, playing it rather low down on the people of this country. It would have been like the action of King David, who, when he was rebuked by a higher Power for making a census of his people&#x2014;presumably with a view to increased taxation&#x2014;and when he was given the alternative of several punishments, evaded that which was to fall upon himself and chose that which was to fall upon his people. I do not think the people would have thanked you had you taken any such course. They would have said that you were merely trying to save your own skins and leaving them to suffer. And when the General Election had come, whether in six or eight months or in two years, instead of respecting you for your caution, they would much more likely have condemned you for your cowardice.<lb/>
But I should like to get away from the question of tactics, because, with all deference to those who have used that argument, it is not upon considerations of expediency, but upon the broadest conception of our duty to ourselves and to the country that your Lordships ought to decide what action you should take. I am doubtful how far I am entitled to lay stress upon the conscientious objection
<col>1258</col>
that I believe many of your Lordships take to this measure. I say I am doubtful, because we are at once met with the retort that our objections are selfish, and indeed that we are not entitled in the case of a Finance Bill to have any conscientious objections at all. That is the absurd and amazing doctrine which is now placed before your Lordships' House. I would like your Lordships to consider the part which it leaves you to play in the Constitution, We are expected to bear our full share in the duties and administration of the country, and when any special effort or outlay is required it is to us that His Majesty's Ministers turn. We are to be taxed up to the hilt, we are to be abused on public platforms and told we are land-grabbers and thieves, and if we are unfortunate enough to be Dukes we fall under the special lash of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But when a Supply Bill or a Finance Bill comes before this House we are to look the other way. If we remember that we are a co-ordinate branch of the Legislature by whose "advice and consent" alone Supplies can be granted to the Crown, we are at once to forget it; if we feel any pangs of conscientious objection we are to suppress them; and so long as the Bill is a Finance Bill, a Bill for the Supply of the year, we have nothing to do in your Lordships' House but to sit here like a number of puppets and nod our heads to the First, Second, and Third Heading of the Bill and pass it into law. I hardly think that is a conception of your duty which will commend itself to your Lordships. Yet that is the naked truth of the position we are now invited to take up. Even if our own sense of self-respect did not forbid us consenting to such an ignoble part, I hardly think we have a right to do it in view of the larger interests which are placed in our hands.<lb/>
What is the real character of the issue before this House and the country? The Government are fighting for the principle that the House of Commons may send up any measure, however dangerous, Socialistic, and subversive in our view it may be, and provided it can be cramped within the four quarters of the Finance Bill of the year we are to have no alternative but to pass it. That is a novel, a revolutionary, and an intolerable claim. It is one which your Lordships have never acknowledged, and which you have no right to acknowledge now. You have no

right to acknowledge it in the interests of this House, because it is clear that this House would be reduced to legislative impotence if it were possible to take particular Bills out of the ordinary course of legislative procedure and tie them up under the cover and label of a Finance Bill, and in that way circumvent your Lordships and pass them through your Lordships' House. You have no right to give away without a struggle the rights and privileges which you have enjoyed and which have been vindicated by many of your greatest Statesmen and orators for 250 years.<lb/>
But I think there is a higher sanction still. You have no right to do this in the interests of the people at large. Remember that your surrender now would mean that nothing would stand in future between the people and the power of the House of Commons, which, in other words, means the Government of the day, to pass into law whatever they might desire. You would really be committing the country to a single Chamber Constitution. That means a Constitution in which one Chamber can override the other without the necessity of an appeal to the people. And in that case it would only be a natural and almost logical consequences for some Minister or some Government to come forward at a future date and propose that this Constitution of ours, which we have always thought the glory of this country and the wonder of the world, should be assimilated to the single Chamber model of Bulgaria or Greece.<lb/>
May I now endeavour to answer the implication made in the speech of the most rev. Prelate that your Lordships are taking a novel and unconstitutional course? As far as I can understand the charge of unconstitutional procedure, it takes two forms. The first contention is that we are acting unconstitutionally in compelling an appeal to the country. I confess I do not fully appreciate the nature of this charge. It appears to me to be inherent in the rights of any Second Chamber&#x2014;and I find them described as such in all the constitutional handbooks&#x2014;that in the last resort a Second Chamber can compel a reference to the polls. The time may arise and does sometimes arise when a disagreement between the two bodies can only be settled by such a solution. I am quite willing to say that the cases in which that right should be exercised must be closely circumscribed in practice. I can only imagine two cases in which
<col>1260</col>
it would be right for a Second Chamber to take such a course. One would be the case in which the Government of the day had introduced some measure in flagrant conflict with the expressed will of the nation. The other would be the case of legislation embodying principles or provisions which had never been submitted to or approved by the electorate of the country. In either of such cases it would appear to me to be part of the inherent duty of a Second Chamber to say that the measure should not become law until it had been referred to the judgment of the people. Such a power is safeguarded by the obvious check that if it is rashly or frivolously used it recoils on the head of those who use it. Therefore I am not greatly moved when I hear these charges of unconstitutional action in this respect, because it seems to me, that the country is protected in the first place by the evidence of history, by the records of your Lordships' House, which show that although you have enjoyed these powers for hundreds of years you have exercised them with very considerable moderation and self-restraint; secondly, by the force of public opinion to which your Lordships have never shown any unwillingness to bow; and, in the third place, by the instinct of self-preservation which is likely to prevent your Lordships from any foolish or partisan proceeding.<lb/>
The second charge of unconstitutional procedure to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord James of Hereford, and the most rev. Archbishop alluded is a rather different one. It is that we are doing a novel and unconstitutional thing in rejecting the Finance Bill of the year. I do not propose to argue the question whether there is a distinction between the law and the Constitution or whether there is a distinction between Money Bills and Supply Bills. The constitutional authorities have argued both these questions in this debate. I am prepared, for the purpose of argument, to suppose that such a distinction can be drawn in both cases. But that does not settle the matter. What is the history and what are the facts of the case? The history of this controversy, into which I have not the slightest desire to plunge, may be roughly summarised, first as the period extending from the time of the Stuarts to 1860, and, secondly, as the period from 1861 to the present day. In the interval between the two, in 1860 and 1861, there stand out like landmarks on a flat horizon the incidents
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0637"/>
<col>1261</col>
of those two years. The history of the matter up to 1860 it is unnecessary to recapitulate. As everybody knows, this controversy has gone on with varying fortunes on either side and many vicissitudes for centuries.<lb/>
The right of the House of Lords to reject Money Bills and even to amend Money Bills has been constantly claimed, frequently exercised, and even admitted by the House of Commons. These rights were conclusively vindicated in the debates of 1860. There is still in your Lordships' House a Peer, and for all I know there may be more than one, who heard the famous speech which was delivered by Lord Lyndhurst, on May 21, 1860, on his eighty-eighth birthday, stating, recapitulating, and advocating with all the power of his undimmed intellect and with all the force of unexhausted youth the rights and privileges of your Lordships' House. That Peer was my own father, and he and his son will go together into the Lobby to-night in support of the propositions which Lord Lyndhurst laid down in a manner which could never be challenged on that occasion. In 1860 your Lordships did precisely what we are told is unconstitutional now. They threw out the Paper Duty Bill, in spite of the fact that it was contended by Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville that it was an essential part of the Supply of the year. That was the whole case of the Government. But your Lordships, acting on the advice of Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Chelmsford, and Lord Derby, threw the Bill out.<lb/>
What happened? The House of Commons did then what I believe they are going to do now. They passed a number of Resolutions affirming the prerogative of the House of Commons. Mr. Disraeli, satisfied with the admissions of Lord Palmerston and Mr. Gladstone as to the rights and privileges of your Lordships' House, actually, I believe, voted for the Resolutions. But in the next year Mr. Gladstone inaugurated a new financial era. In order to circumvent your Lordships House&#x2014;the whole story is told in the book of the noble Viscount opposite&#x2014;he embodied for the first time in a single Bill all the measures which it had previously been the fashion to send up one by one. That was a piece of strategy on the part of Mr. Gladstone; it was deliberately avowed as such. He left on record a statement in which he said the House of Lords for its misconduct was deservedly extinguished in
<col>1262</col>
effect as to all matters of finance. It is true that in the following year, when the conflict might have been resumed by your Lordships' House, the House of Lords did not do so, but took another course on the advice of Lord Derby, mainly because the Paper Duty Bill was a Bill not for the imposition but the relief of taxation, and because it was one with the principle of which the Conservative Party agreed. The measure was accordingly accepted as part of the Finance Bill of the year.<lb/>
But my point is that the House of Lords did not on that occasion surrender their rights. They remained intact, they could not be extinguished by the openly avowed and vindictive act of a Minister in the other House. They could not be extinguished by any act of the House of Commons. If now your Lordships choose to revive them, they can only be, destroyed by an overwhelming pronouncement on the part of the country. The idea that your Lordships are doing anything now for the first time which is entirely novel and unconstitutional is therefore an idea without foundation. You are doing now what you did in 1860. When Lord James says, "How comes it that this action is now taken for the first time?" the answer then is this&#x2014;It was taken repeatedly up to the year 1860, but it was taken in a different form, because the Bills always came before you separately up to that date. The reason why you have never taken this step since 1860 is that no Chancellor of the Exchequer has been found in that interval to put before you a Bill like the present Bill, which so directly challenges the constitutional prerogative of your Lord-ships' House and compels you to take a course of action which you have never signified your intention to relinquish but which occasion has not arisen to take during the last fifty years. We deny, therefore, that we are now setting up any new or extravagant claim. We recognise the right of the House of Commons to control, under normal conditions, the finances of the country. But we say that we have the power and the duty, always enjoyed and frequently acted upon, to see that that right is not abused in order to carry through, under the guise of financial measures, policies or principles which have not been approved by the people. And we signify our willingness to bow to the final expression of the popular will when once it has been expressed in clear and constitutional form.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0638"/>
<col>1263</col>
My Lords, that seems to me to be the constitutional position. I only desire to say this in conclusion. If that is our case from the constitutional side, is it not worth drawing attention to the fact that a constitutional case is also being set up by the Government? What is the policy of these ardent defenders of the Constitution? The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack a few days ago told us, when he read from that historic sheet of paper, that no Liberal Government would consent ever again to bear the heavy burden of office unless it was secured against a repetition of the treatment they have met with during the last four years. Surely, my Lords, there was there the inception, the announcement, of a revolution incomparably greater than any revolution which can possibly arise from a reference of the Finance Bill of the year to the people as a whole.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord committed the Liberal Party to the destruction of the veto of this House and the subversion of the ancient balance and equipoise of our Constitution. Surely here, if anywhere, was a rupture of the unbroken custom and usage and convention of hundreds of years. I think I might use the language of the noble and learned Lord himself and say that this seems to me to be a direct invasion both of the privileges of your Lordships' House and of the prerogative of the Crown. I believe, therefore, that when we go to the country on this question of constitutional or unconstitutional usage the country will be quite sufficiently intelligent to see where the real revolution lies&#x2014;whether in the action of your Lordships, who in the discharge of what you believe to be your duty are going to refer this measure to the people, or in the action of the Government, which, because it cannot get its own way, proposes to break up the ancient Constitution of this country in order to render the House of Commons supreme.<lb/>
We have been told by almost every speaker in this debate in language of varying menace, that if we throw out this Bill we are only at the beginning of a conflict of which no one can foresee the end. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack was more precise. He told us it could only end in one way. I do not think, even if I were a Minister, I should like to be quite so confident. I think it is quite likely we are at the commencement; of a long and arduous struggle, and that the
<col>1264</col>
component parts of the Constitution may emerge from that struggle in an altered form. There are some of us on this side of the House who would not shrink from that consequence. Nay, there are some who would warmly welcome it. That we should have a Second Chamber in this country&#x2014;a reformed House of Lords, for that is the popular phrase&#x2014;possessing elements of strength denied to ourselves and supplementing the existing Constitution from sources to which we cannot turn, is an aspiration which is dear to the hearts of many who sit in this Chamber. I hope that it may be reserved for the Party to which I have the honour to belong, should the opportunity ever occur, to carry such aspirations into execution. I wish I could cherish the hope that we are likely in such an attempt to receive the support and encouragement of noble Lords opposite; but, however that may be, I trust and I confidently believe, that there will emerge from this controversy upon which we are about to embark, an unmistakable mandate from the country&#x2014;not, perhaps, at the first election, for we are told that the issues are likely to be confused, but at some subsequent election, because this matter cannot be decided by one election, possibly not even by two&#x2014;I hope there will emerge from the conflict an unmistakable mandate from the people of this country that a Second Chamber is an absolutely essential feature in our Constitution, and that that Second Chamber shall not be a mere phantom, rendered equally impotent and ridiculous by the paralysis of its powers and scarcely worthy to deliberate if it could only delay; but that it shall be a Second Chamber representing, as your Lordships have endeavoured faithfully to do for many centuries, the stability, the character, and the experience of the State, and one which, like your Lordships' House, and I hope in an even superior degree, will be independent and fearless and strong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03684"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with pleasure to the valuable, speech with which we have been favoured this evening from the most rev. Prelate the Archbishop of York. In its large argument, logical in the best sense of the word and yet elevated, he practically said everything that need be said to cover the great scope of the arguments which should be addressed on the question now before your Lordships. But the noble Lord who has just sat down has
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0639"/>
<col>1265</col>
supplied one topic which must be discussed. He has entered into this debate in a very vigorous fashion, and I must congratulate him upon having from first to last shown no sign of that physical weakness which he pleaded when he first began. He has been energetic and combative to the last degree, and instead of in any way attempting to moderate a very grave situation, he has left it aggravated. He has infused into it a spirit most unfriendly to peaceful counsels. He has used arguments which when carried to the country will, I fear, prove prejudicial to the very object he has at heart, and may end in the mutilation and weakening of that Second Chamber for which he was speaking and the curtailment of the powers he has been attempting to uphold.<lb/>
The noble Lord began his argument by suggesting that it was outside our purpose to enter into the moral reasons which had been brought forward in support of the Budget as being devoted to excellent ends. If I were to enter upon the question of the purposes to which the money which this Finance Bill will supply is to be devoted, I might have to say something in part of which I should find myself alone, and in other parts I should find myself supported by but few. I do not hold with the noble Lord that the present Government have been weak in supplying money for the defences of the country; on the contrary, I think they are open to censure for having yielded to ignorant panic and having increased the naval and military expenditure to which we are exposed. The noble Lord said no additions are involved in the present Budget on account of our national defences. The noble Lord seems to have forgotten that something like &#x00A3;3,000,000 was added to the Naval Estimates embodied in this particular Finance Bill. I might enter upon the second part, and I should demur personally to some portions of the expenditure proposed to be devoted to what is called social service, but these are not the questions involved in the Finance Bill.<lb/>
We have an expenditure of &#x00A3;160,000,000 which has to be met. The Commons send up their plan of meeting that expenditure embodied in the Supply Bill, and for the first time in our history you are going to reject it. That is the novelty, the unprecedented novelty, which this House is going to perpetrate. In the way of
<col>1266</col>
defending the Constitution and the rights of this House, you are going to do something which has never been done before. The noble Lord said this House in 1860 rejected the Paper Duties Bill, and spoke of it as if it was a Bill to impose duties on paper instead of being a Bill for their repeal. But the Supply Bill of the year has come up year after year for a period as to which the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. Has it ever been rejected before? Lord James of Hereford told us last night of the peculiar fashion in which it is presented to you, all indicative of the supreme, you may say exclusive, control of the House of Commons over the supplies of the year. We have heard year after year the quaint formula in which the Supply Bill is proclaimed and made an Act of Parliament, <i>Le Roi remercie ses bons sujets</i>; and in the Speech at the close of the session His Majesty thanks the gentlemen of the House of Commons for the liberal supplies they have given to meet the national wants. This will not happen this year. There are no supplies for which thanks can be given. The House of Commons cannot receive the thanks from the Throne. What is to happen? Surely, my Lords, that is a very serious question to consider. It is not a matter of mere form. There must be a Speech from the Throne. You will have in a few days the Prorogation, and that Prorogation will be followed as we all know by a Dissolution, It will be impossible in the Speech from the Throne to avoid a reference to what has happened. In what way will that be expressed? Will it be by way of regret? I suppose that it will not be by way of censure, but it will require the most delicate measurement of words, the most careful use of language to prevent that Message from the Throne being perverted, however discreet the Ministers of the Crown may be, and to prevent this mischief the words in the Message from the Throne may be converted into cries of war. This is what you are precipitating.<lb/>
By the rejection of this Bill you are precipitating for the first time a Dissolution. The noble Lord who has just spoken says that the Second Chamber always had the right of compelling a reference to the country. The Second Chamber has always had the right of reserving its assent to particular Bills, which may be withheld and which may become the subject of a reference to the country when a General
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0640"/>
<col>1267</col>
Election happens; but the right so reserved and exercised does not compel us here and now to insist upon an immediate reference to the country. You may, for example, reject an Education Bill or an Irish Land Bill, and Parliament may go on for two or three years. You may reject other measures, and you may go on until Parliament expires; but in rejecting the Finance Bill as you will do you compel at once an appeal to the country, and thus you are acting in a manner for which no precedent can be cited, in a manner which has never been attempted even by the boldest advocate of the rights of your Lordships in past times. In the Amendment you say that you are going to consult the judgment of the country on this Bill. It is part of the mischief of the situation which you are creating that you cannot consult the judgment of the country on this particular issue. You cannot ask the country "Yes" or "No" on the merits of the Finance Bill. The issue before the country will be something very much larger and broader than that comprehended in the Amendment. It must cover a larger field of appeal upon other grounds; and the question which the noble Lord deprecates being Taised&#x2014;the relations between the two Houses of Parliament&#x2014;is raised in a worse fashion, because you are appealing to the country, who may sustain you in matters of legislation, with the embarrassing addition that you claim this novel power of interference in matters of finance. There are-many voters who will not uphold you in claiming a right to interfere with the financial arrangements of the Government. Here for the first time you are taking a new departure. Those who reverence the Constitution, those who most respect it, those who desire to see the different forces which constitute the governing powers of this nation maintained in their efficacy and in some degree of relative strength, must deplore the action which has brought us to this position.<lb/>
The whole question of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament will be submitted to the country, under the cry that the Lords are interfering with the taxation decreed by the representatives of the people, and that they are taking upon themselves the power of the purse, and that for the first time in history they are presuming to deal with taxation. That is surely a very unwise step to take even from the point of view of the noble Lord who last
<col>1268</col>
addressed the House. I should have thought he would have given some reason to justify it. But the greater part of the noble Lord's speech dealt with the speeches of other noble Lords sitting on the Cross Benches who join him in denunciation of the Budget, or at all events of some parts of it, but who deprecate the rejection of this Bill because they see that in the rejection you are involving other questions to which they pay the utmost regard, and to which the noble Lord himself pays the utmost regard, but as to which he says that he will take the consequences. In his argument addressed to those noble Lords, however, he did not really grapple with the fundamental issue&#x2014;namely, the right of this House to interfere with the financial arrangements of the year. He passed that by. He assumed that because under the forms of the Constitution the concurrence of this House is necessary to the passing of such a Bill, though the Bill comes up as a free gift from the Commons, the consequence of that concurrence is that, having the power, you have the right, and having got the right you have the duty, and having the duty you must exercise and perform the duty, and reject this Bill. On what grounds? On financial grounds, on grounds of pure finance? These are good grounds to be argued in the House of Commons or on political platforms, but the grounds which have been advanced here for the rejection of the Bill never have been recognised as constituting a sufficient reason for such a rejection.<lb/>
It is true&#x2014;it is, of course, undeniable&#x2014;that the concurrence of your Lordships is necessary to the passing of a Supply measure. You have the power, but to pass from the power to a declaration that you have the right, still more to pass from the assertion of a right to the assertion of a duty, you must take into consideration what is the antecedent history of your country, the antecedent powers of this House, and what are the consequences involved in your action. You must, as the most rev. Prelate said, take heed of the consequences and see whether in your action you are not really violating the principles to which you ought to be most devoted and which you ought most strongly to uphold. It is a most dangerous business this of mixing up finance and legislation, and the peril is that in grasping at this novel power over finance you may imperil the power you undoubtedly have over
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0641"/>
<col>1269</col>
legislation. As I have said, this General Election cannot involve a referendum on the subject of the Budget. You do not go to the country asking for an "aye" or "no" on the Finance Bill. Unlike the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, in its proper place and in relation to legislation I do not entirely exclude from consideration the possible adoption of the machinery of the referendum at some future time. It may become necessary for the peaceful and due working of our Constitution, but the notion of applying the referendum or its machinery to the question whether a Finance Bill shall or shall not become law is, as some of us who have looked into the machinery would say, at once seen to be unworkable. It dislocates all your finance, which must be settled within the course of the twelve months, and if it is done by the action of this branch of the Legislature you throw everything out of gear.<lb/>
It is wonderful to me the simplicity with which this notion of the referendum with reference to this Finance Bill has been brought forward in many quarters. An ingenious gentleman who exercises a considerable influence in the columns of the leading journal, thought not long ago that it could be solved by the simple process of sending circulars through the post. His Majesty's Government, or someone else, was to send circulars through the post, with prepaid replies annexed thereto, and the replies were somehow or other to come back; and in this way you were to find out the opinion of the country on the subject before them. It is worth while to follow for a minute the working of this suggestion. Imagine your postman in the streets of London, in the rural districts of England, and in the remote counties in Ireland taking round these sheaves of circulars on which the electors are somehow or other, without verification or identification, without possibility of any guarantee, to make their mark and return them. How many people you would get to reply I do not know; who would get those replies is still very obscure; but it is obvious that such machinery as that is totally inapplicable to the particular subject of the Amendment which is now before us.<lb/>
In the General Election which is now coming, you will find it is a matter of boast&#x2014;the noble Lord opposite admitted that it would be a matter of boast&#x2014;that you will not be able to confine this issue
<col>1270</col>
to the merits or the demerits of this particular scheme of finance. What the country will be asked to vote upon will be, "What shall be the limitations on the power of this House, and in what degree shall this House co-operate in the future with the other House in passing the laws of the country?" That is a very serious question to have put in this haphazard way before the people, and I think your Lordships are not over-confident of what the answer will be. I even seem to detect a feeling that you are not going to win in this particular controversy; that you will not win ultimately I am firmly convinced. Even the noble Lord who last spoke seemed to have some doubts upon that point, but that you should win even in this present issue seems to me extremely unlikely. In the midst of the combative spirit and the passions of this controversy I would ask your Lordships to reflect a little on how this General Election will work, brought on as it is in the fashion I have described. You are not going to win. An industrious gentleman in <i>The Times</i>, who has shown a very patient and it appears to me a very judicious spirit on the whole, has gone through the Kingdom and has made his observations as to the probabilities of success in this or that constituency, and he has given the results of his investigations in two or three issues of that newspaper. Well, he is not very confident. He does not add up the results; though anybody who takes the trouble will find that he does not indicate a victory for the Opposition, but that perhaps the supporters of the Opposition in the other House after the General Election will approach to something like equality with the avowed supporters of the Government. There will, however, remain two independent bodies of members&#x2014;the Nationalists and the Labour Party.<lb/>
Is it a light matter that you should provoke a General Election&#x2014;with its tumultuous, confused, passionate appeals&#x2014;on the relations between the two Houses which will probably result in the election of another House of the fashion I have described? Do you think it is a satisfactory matter to contemplate? Are you pleased at the suggestion that the Nationalists and Labour Party should hold the balance in that assembly? Even as regards this House, what are your feelings with respect to those two sets of members? What are their feelings towards
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0642"/>
<col>1271</col>
you? The Nationalists are not very fond of your Lordships; I suppose if there is one section of the House of Commons more opposed to your Lordships than another it would be the Irish Nationalists, because your Lordships have too often thwarted their desires. I do not say whether that was right or wrong, but the thing has happened. And the Labour Members, they will not feel any very great respect for your Lordships. Remember, however narrow may be the balance between the Ministerialists and the Opposition in the new House of Commons, the very first question raised there must be this question of the power of this House over the Budget and this question of the relations of the two Houses. Upon this question there will be no doubt about the energy with which these outlying groups of members will support the Government in their strongest demands, and probably even urge them to make them stronger than the Government desire. This is the future which you are very light-heartedly preparing to encounter. It ought to make us grave&#x2014;not make us combative or desirous of victories over one another. It ought to make us take into grave and serious consideration what is the immediate future before us and how we can escape from these perils.<lb/>
You are developing the revolutionary spirit&#x2014;that is the danger of the time. In your departure from constitutional practice you are giving a lesson which may be improved upon. And there are plenty of persons about who are quite ready to take the lead your Lordships give, and as soon as you suspend habitual usage, they will show the same contempt for the practices which have gone before. Already there are very strange suggestions made as to how we shall get through the coming crisis. In more than one apparently responsible quarter the suggestion is made that the Government should levy the taxes without Parliamentary authority, go on as if they were endowed with full power and permission from the Legislature, and by their own administrative authority alone do that which it has hitherto been held they are disentitled from doing unless supported by Resolution of the House of Commons and before the year is over by a statute of Parliament. There are other suggestions, because the minds of men are occupied with what is going to be done in the next stage&#x2014;suggestions showing something of the same hot temper, the same extraordinary departure
<col>1272</col>
from calm and moderate counsels which ought to be present in the consideration of such problems as these. It is a natural suggestion&#x2014;that in order to enforce upon your Lordships those changes in your position some action shall be taken such as was consented to by King William when Lord Grey obtained from him power to create a sufficient number of Peers to carry the Reform Bill. I have heard it suggested that if similar advice were now tendered to His Majesty, and if His Majesty were graciously pleased to assent to the proposition, your Lordships should be invited to pass a Resolution to exclude the new Peers from taking their places among you. Such a step was never conceived by the Duke of Wellington, not even by Lord Eldon. One unconstitutional thing leads-to another, and this comes from a grave, discreet expositor of English law, who for the first time makes this suggestion.<lb/>
Bear with me if I go one step further and suggest another consideration which you may, I think, with advantage take to-heart. In what you are going to do now you are departing from constitutional usage. You are violating usage. This will always be remembered of you. You say you have good and sufficient reasons&#x2014;I do not inquire at this moment what they are&#x2014;for breaking the constitutional usage. There is no legal power to prevent you from passing this resolution and carrying it out. You can break the constitutional practice be the result what it may. No one can prevent it. Let us see how far that kind of argument may lead, and, I believe, is leading some people. Pray consider, my Lords, how each one of us is in this Chamber. Some are here by creation, some by descent. In the former case Letters Patent under the Great Seal confer upon a man a Peerage. He does not sit in consequence of that; that is not enough. The Letters Patent are followed up by a Writ of Summons requiring him in the, special circumstances of the realm to come and give his counsel and advice in the great affairs which are in debate and aid in the government of the country. The Writ of Summons is apart from, separate from, independent of, though in practice consequent upon, the Letters Patent conferring upon him a Peerage. In the same way in the case of a Peer who comes in by succession. He does not of necessity come immediately into this House. If he does not apply for a Writ of Summons he may
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0643"/>
<col>1273</col>
remain out all his life, as Peers have done, and never sit here. If he applies for a Writ of Summons, it is issued and he comes here; and your Lordships sit here by virtue of Writs of Summons. The Writs of Summons are issued at the General Election to particular Peers who are members of the House immediately before the dissolution of the Parliament, and afterwards to those Peers who have been created during the Parliament.<lb/>
But, my Lords, what if these Writs of Summons were withheld? It is all constitutional usage, followed as a matter of course, but there is no power to compel it being followed. If under the advice of the Minister&#x2014;I am not going to suggest that such advice should be given&#x2014;the Writ were withheld, there is no Court that could enforce it. You cannot get a <i>mandamus</i> against the Crown. The excluded Peers would have no power of enforcing their entrance into this House. I do not know what they would do. They might in such a contingency hold a mass meeting in Trafalgar Square, or organise a promenade towards Westminster, but in the way of legal redress I am not aware of any power under which they could enter this Chamber.<lb/>
In a word, just as the constitutional usage can be departed from without any power of preventing that departure in regard to the passing of Supply Bills, so constitutional usage with respect to issuing Writs of Summons to Peers could be departed from, and the Crown is entirely master of the situation. Charles I, tried it on, and this House resolved that it was improper, but the King had got into difficulties with the other Chamber and did not find it convenient to quarrel with both Lords and Commons, and so he gave way and the excluded Peer took his seat. But in the language used on the other side the non-exercise of the power does not prevent the power being used if a Minister were audacious enough, resolute enough, and animated by so few scruples as to be able to advise it. My Lords, I do not like the situation when such revolutionary schemes are considered and talked about. I want to see this order of ours&#x2014;I mean the order of the nation and not of this House&#x2014;change from old to new by slow evolution, without violence, fury, or passion, without anything like civil discord breaking out into strife between contending

families of men. I want to see things work out equably; but under the impulse of the step the majority of your Lordships are about to take you will find the problems I have suggested will be developed under the necessity proclaimed by the Lord Chancellor of ensuring for the future for the Liberal Government some different position from that which it has occupied in the past; you will raise all these questions and raise them in the worst possible fashion for a Second Chamber.<lb/>
No one of us would wish to expose the noble Marquess opposite to anything like a personal rebuff, especially after the magnificent exhibition of courage he gave us last week when he made his speech at the opening of this debate. But who cannot help feeling that it would be better for him, better for his Party, better for this House, better for this nation, that his Amendment should be defeated? It will not be. I regret it cannot be, but I am absolutely persuaded that it would be to the advantage of the country if it could happen. It would be a terrible disappointment to some friends of mine outside. I admit that, but what a relief it would be to many of us, to many of your Lordships, and to the sober-minded inhabitants of the nation at large that this issue, which no doubt is inevitable&#x2014;the noble Lord who spoke just now said this issue was inevitable&#x2014;should be tried under better circumstances and not, as now, mixed up with the question of finance, with the control over the purse, with that violation of all the traditions embodied in so many phrases, recognised in so many words habitually forming parts of our common ways of thinking about the working of our Constitution, in the fashion which it is in this particular Amendment.<lb/>
The rejection of this Amendment will not be. I regret it. I regret most of all that those noble Lords who see the unwisdom of the path upon which we have entered, who deprecate the action of the noble Marquess in putting this Amendment before the House, and who want to save this House from the peril involved in it&#x2014;I am most sorry that they have not been able to take the courage to come over and show that this is not a Party issue, and to show by the Division that sober-minded men, habitually opposed to His Majesty's Government, even condemning most bitterly the provisions of this Finance Bill, will still
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0644"/>
<col>1275</col>
rally in defence of the Constitution against the innovation now threatened. Party connections, personal bias, the combinations of groups&#x2014;these may lead to and do explain the action which I do deplore. I wish we could have been strengthened and the country could have been encouraged by something more than a mere resolution net to vote for the Amendment; by their coming over and voting for the passing of the Bill. It will require all the good temper, all the moderation, all the fairness of mind, all the self-control that is possible in every section of the political world to see us through the controversy which is now opened, and I would that, at the commencement, we had all shown ourselves a little more forward in proclaiming our views as to the necessity of maintaining the traditions of this House in respect of finance, and that noble Lords from the other side would have risen to the height of the occasion, not being content with simply saying, "We dislike the Bill, but we cannot vote for the Amendment," but going on to say, "Though we dislike the Bill, we will vote for the Bill because in voting for it, we show our attachment and devotion to the constitutional principles of the country."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03685"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GOSCHEN`</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will not accuse me of any egotistical feeling if I venture to say that the financial traditions in which I have been brought up would naturally impress upon me the seriousness of the character of the vote to be given on this occasion. I admit that with some portions of the Budget it would be possible to agree, but surely it is not only what is contained in the Budget that we have to think of, but also the form in which it has been introduced. I presume that the general form in which a Budget is introduced, the character of a usual Budget, is to provide for the financial necessities of the year on an equable basis of taxation, with as little disturbance as possible to the trade and industry of the country. I do not wish now to stop to argue whether this Budget achieves that or not, but surely it goes very much further than this. Besides introducing novel elements in the actual imposition of the taxes themselves, it lays down and provides for extravagant machinery at great expense, far in excess of what is necessary for the output of the financial year and capable of an increase in the future which it is impossible to foresee.<lb/>
<col>1276</col>
And, my Lords, with all due deference to the most rev. Prelate who spoke earlier in the evening, surely we cannot, in considering this novel departure, forget the attendant circumstances in which this Finance Bill has been introduced and the opinions which have been expressed in support of it, not only by His Majesty's Government and their supporters, but also by their candid critics both in this country and abroad. It is the anxiety as to what is going to be the future taxation to be imposed and collected under the machinery which is proposed by this Finance Bill that is disturbing the credit and upsetting the financial business of the country at the present moment. There is nothing which is so injurious to credit as uneasiness as to what is going to happen in the future, uncertainty as to how it may be affected, and the feeling&#x2014;I think on this occasion the justifiable feeling&#x2014;that a blow is going to fall upon it, but how hard a one it is impossible to realise. I believe it is easier for the credit of the country to recover from an actual blow that has fallen upon it than from the uncertainty which is at the present moment prevailing. And, as your Lordships know, the further danger in this system of what I may call Budgetting for the future is that it tends to encourage Chancellors of the Exchequer to extravagance by placing at their disposal a machinery for easily collecting taxes in the future, and to discourage thrift by frightening capital.<lb/>
Lord Revelstoke the other evening described how capital was being frightened and was leaving the country, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, who, I think, is not in his place at the present moment, in criticising that speech said that the noble Lord had given us a glimpse of the Temple of Mammon and had asked whether it was right that it should be disturbed. The noble Earl went on in his criticism to say that to him and some of his friends there was a vision, not only of slightly disturbed finance or of the unfortunate persons who might be losing a quarter per cent., but of starved humanity on the Embankment. The noble Earl also, I think, said that this showed to him clearly why it was that the City was in the rear of social progress. This is not the place nor the opportunity to debate the question whether the City is or has been in the rear of social progress, but that it is not entirely the dehumanised
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0645"/>
<col>1277</col>
money-making machine it was described to be by another noble Lord is proved by the grants it has always been ready to contribute to any funds that have been raised for the amelioration of distress. But I think it is right here to say that the City, in its anxiety as to capital leaving the country, is not only thinking of itself, but of those who depend upon the maintenance and the security of capital in this country for their livelihood. The City is not only composed of a number of financiers who are thinking of their own profit. It is the financial nerve-centre of this country, to which flow the savings and earnings of all classes of the community which it again distributes throughout the country, making them capital accessible everywhere. And surely, if not from the highest motives, at least from their business instincts, those who are responsible for the use and custody of this money might be credited with a recognition of the fact that it is upon the mutual dependence of their own interests upon those of their customers and of their clients that the stability of credit rests. It is upon the character of their policy that really depends the credit of this country.<lb/>
Many of us can give proofs that capital, not surplus capital, as has been frequently said, but actual capital is leaving this country, and that the interest of that capital is also being used abroad. But I think there is one fact with regard to capital which is more important even than this, and that is that the Government are, by this Finance Bill, taking capital and using it as income. One of the chief objections to the Finance Bill is that it kills enterprise. It kills enterprise by frightening capital; and in doing this it puts a tax on the raw material of industry. Take the Death Duties. The Death Duties are the culminating tax upon one form of property upon which other taxes, such as Income Tax, Super Tax, and Land Tax, will have to be paid, and, in order to pay these, capital will have to be entrenched upon in many cases. I do not ask for pity for those who will have to pay that capital, but it is others, and those not the rich, that we have to think of. If you are anxious to see great enterprises or great industries started in this country you need those who possess capital, and who are prepared not only to put their capital into them,
<col>1278</col>
but to risk it, and, if necessary, to lose it. Take the great enterprises of electric lighting and electric traction. At the first moment they were only mere ventures, and at the start they had need of a large amount of capital to be put into them. Now they are great successes, and they are at the present moment employing a vast amount of labour; they are giving out large sums of money in wages, and by their success they have contributed largely to the comfort and happiness of all classes in this country. Now the State desires to equalise the distribution of wealth; but if the State goes too far in the direction of regulating wealth, take care that the amount to be distributed is not so diminished as to cause universal loss.<lb/>
I was going through the papers the other day of one whose memory I think is not forgotten by members of your Lordships' House, and I came across a passage in a speech which was delivered by my father in 1885, in Edinburgh, which I do not think is inappropriate to this discussion, and which as it is short I will, with your permission, quote. He was expressing the hope that in the campaign of that time no effort would be made to stir up the feeling of class against class, and he pointed out that the interests of all were dependent one on the other. He said&#x2014;
<quote>" There are some who seem to look upon the wealth of this country as if it were simply money contained in a cash-box, and that you can give the key either to one party or the other party, to one class or the other class, to help themselves from that cash-box. The wealth of this country is not a fixed quantity. It is one that increases or diminishes according as there is wise and stable and just legislation. It would indeed be a disaster to the country if we should simply adopt the principle, ' There is a certain fixed amount of wealth; all that is wanted is to distribute it differently, forgetting that we must endeavour so to legislate that the prosperity, wealth, and well-being of all classes may be promoted and increased&#x2026;. Do not let us run away with the idea that taxes upon property are for the benefit of the poorer classes, or of the producing classes."</quote>
These are the words, not of a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, but of a Liberal candidate in the campaign of 1885. Like several other speakers who have addressed your Lordships' House in this debate, I am one of those who do not hold the same economic faith as noble Lords who sit around me. I am a Free Trader, but that does not in the slightest degree incline me the more to support this Budget, or prevent me acting with noble Lords
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0646"/>
<col>1279</col>
who sit around me on this occasion. I do not believe that this Budget is the only alternative to Tariff Reform. I believe that this Budget contains the seeds of a policy which is dangerous to the trade and credit of this country, and will disturb the balance of capital, and, believing this, I hold that we who are opposed to this Budget ought to show a united front in submitting it to the judgment of the people. I intend this evening to vote for the Amendment of the noble Marquess, and in doing so I do not for a moment consider that I am acting inconsistently with those principles of Free Trade which I hold or which I have inherited.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03686"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU, OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have heard with great interest the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down, and especially his concluding words in which he declared himself to be a Free Trader. As one who is going to support the Amendment before the House, I purpose to support the noble Marquess in his Amendment for other reasons which I shall lay before your Lordships. To begin with, although I like others who have been in the House of Commons realise to the full the gravity of the situation and the indispensable nature of the control of the House of Commons over the ordinary realms of finance, still on this occasion the issue is so grave that in my humble judgment this House is justified in interfering.<lb/>
I propose for a moment to address myself to one or two aspects of the Budget which are more of a special than a general nature. First of all, I would remark in one single sentence that so far as the interests of the particular industry which I have the honour, to a certain extent, to speak for in this House&#x2014;the motor car industry&#x2014;are concerned, although we naturally dislike the taxes put upon us by the Bill we acknowledge that the Government have met us fairly about the Road Improvement Bill, and we consider as far as that is concerned that we have got something, so to speak, for our money. I do not wish, therefore, on that point to attack noble Lords opposite, or to say anything that is unfair. I prefer to pass on to another subject. I would like to show how grave is the effect of the Death Duties, which, in combination with other taxes, affect a class which is numerically small. If you
<col>1280</col>
take the history of the Death Duties, beginning in 1894 under Sir William Har-court, one cannot help being struck by the fact that every successive Chancellor of the Exchequer, no matter to which side of politics he happened to belong, has made the excuse that he is only raising these duties by half or one per cent., and it seems to be totally left out of consideration&#x2014;and here to some extent I blame, with all deference, my own side of the House as well as the other&#x2014;that these Death Duties have been raised to a point which in my opinion is extremely dangerous. The noble Lord who last spoke said this tendency has the effect of driving capital out of the country. It will have another effect. It will increase the tendency to evasion, for citizens are not encouraged to accept a system of taxation which they feel inherently unjust.<lb/>
I will give instances of the extraordinary increase in these duties in the case of three estates, one admitted to be a great estate, one the estate of a well-to-do man, and one the case of a man who made a considerable sum in trade, but whose estate when he left it to his successors could not be described as wealthy. In the case of an estate of &#x00A3;800,000, the duty under Sir William Harcourt's Budget in 1894 would have been at the rate of eight and a-half per cent. I am taking the case of estates settled from father to son, where the Death Duties would be less heavy than in any other form. This estate, when Mr. Asquith was Chancellor of the Exchequer, would have paid eleven and a-half per cent., but the present Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Bill before the House would charge this estate with sixteen per cent. The payments in those three cases are &#x00A3;68,000 under Sir William Harcourt's Budget, &#x00A3;88,000 under Mr. Asquith's, and no less than &#x00A3;128,000, or nearly double, under Mr. Lloyd-George's Budget. I think that that justifies my assertion that these Death Duties have been increased to a dangerous degree.<lb/>
May I also point out that the hardship is a very grave one to the present generation, whatever may happen in the future? Take the case of a man who insured himself under Sir William Harcourt's Budget, or thirteen years later when Mr. Asquith brought forward his proposals, or fifteen years later when the present Chancellor of the Exchequer brought forward his
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0647"/>
<col>1281</col>
Budget. Insuring against such duties is? almost impossible for the present generation. You may take it that the rates for a man of sixty years may vary according to health and other circumstances from seven to eight per cent.; it is quite impossible for an old man to pay the other calls for which he is responsible and to insure himself against the Death Duties, with the result that these duties in such cases must come entirely out of capital. I will take another case of a settled estate, passing from father to son in which &#x00A3;50,000 is involved. In that case six per cent. was charged by Sir William Harcourt and by Mr. Asquith, and ten per cent. by Mr. Lloyd-George; the payments in this case are raised from &#x00A3;3,000 under Sir William Harcourt and Mr. Asquith to no less than &#x00A3;5,000 under Mr. Lloyd-George. The sum of &#x00A3;50,000 invested produces only about &#x00A3;2,000 a year. You cannot call it a large fortune. It produces the income of a well-to-do man, but not the income of a millionaire.<lb/>
A further case I have to quote to you is taken from facts of which I am personally cognisant. A man in the North of England had made a small fortune in a business of which he and his sons had the management. Under Sir William Harcourt's Budget that estate would have paid five, and a-half per cent., which is equal to &#x00A3;1,375. Under Mr. Asquith in 1907 it would have had to pay the same amount; but under Mr. Lloyd-George's Budget this year the amount is &#x00A3;2,250, or nearly double what would have had to be paid two years ago. I will relate to you the result of that heavy burden. We all take a pride in this country in the continuity of businesses in which the name of a family carries enormous weight. In this case the finding of &#x00A3;2,250 out of &#x00A3;50,000 capital, which is not fluid capital but consists of the interest in the business, as a matter of fact placed that particular family in such a position that they had practically to divide up their business. On the top of that disaster the estate was further subdivided by the deaths of two more members of the family, and the total duties amounted to over thirty per cent. on the total value of the business as it was originally estimated. I say that is a monstrous heightening and increase of the Death Duties, and is not in the best interests of this country. I know that the answer will be that the Death Duties are in their nature a kind of deferred Income
<col>1282</col>
Tax. Let us grant that. Noble Lords opposite have said, no doubt with accuracy, that taking the Income Tax alone, the amount charged upon huge fortunes is not very great; but if you add to 1<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. or even 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;&#x2014;the amount a man has to pay to insure against Death Duties&#x2014;the tax will amount to from 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;1, and I have a case where it meant as much as 6<i>s</i>. in the &#x00A3;. In no other country in the world&#x2014;I defy the Government to quote one&#x2014;is the Income Tax including insurance against Death Duties anything like that sum. If you study the figures you are driven to the conclusion that capital, whether representing landed property or fluid capital or the interest in a business, is to be more heavily taxed in this country than in any other country in the civilised world. That is a very strong thing to say, but it is the fact.<lb/>
Another point I should like to bring before your Lordships is that of the Undeveloped Land Duty. Though it may sound somewhat foreign to the Death Duties, you will find it affects that question also. It sounds very little to say you are going to charge a half penny in the &#x00A3; on this, that, or the other. I am aware the Government only propose at present to tax undeveloped land, and I quite admit there may be cases arguable in which it may encourage men to use up land; but by putting on this Undeveloped Land Duty you have again added to the amount which a man must pay. The result will be, if you add the Income Tax, the Super Tax, the provision for Death Duties, and the Undeveloped Land Tax, that it will amount to 7<i>s</i>. or 8<i>s</i>. in the &#x00A3;. If you take Consols at ninety, which is a fair average, and apply the &#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; tax, in that case the tax amounts to ninety half pennies or 3<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., which is exactly 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; on the income produced of &#x00A3;2 10<i>s</i>. a year. Thus &#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; on the capital value means 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; on the income. It is another Income Tax higher than the existing one, and diminishing a man's power of providing against charges at his death. That, I think, justifies my argument that the increase in the Death Duties is a very serious thing. There is only one justification for this increase so far as I can see. There would be justification if the proceeds of the tax were to be devoted to the redemption of the National Debt. But that is not what is proposed. What are you doing to-day? You are using capital for the ordinary purposes of income, a
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0648"/>
<col>1283</col>
process which I beg leave to say is totally unsound. If you take those heavy duties, which must be in nine cases out of ten raised by mortgages or by the selling of stock, and use them for redeeming the National Debt or the reduction of capital, it will be for the benefit of the nation.<lb/>
It is said that this country is so rich that it is impossible to bleed it to death. Noble Lords opposite tell us that there is every sign of luxury around us, and I have been waiting to hear in the course of the debate that motor cars are the greatest signs of luxury of the age, but we have so far escaped that. No one will deny that we can see on all sides of this great City signs of increasing luxury. I deplore the signs of that luxury. I think it is very often money not well used, and very often it is used ostentatiously; but, however that may be, there are not signs of increasing riches among our own people, broadly speaking. There is a great deal of money spent here by foreigners, whom we welcome to our shores. Money is also spent by rich Americans, who make London their home for a portion of the year. Many millions are made in trade and financial operations, and in nine cases out of ten the origin of the money is not in this country at all. Straws show which way the wind blows. Perhaps it will interest your Lordships if I give you three or four instances out of the Inland Revenue returns showing you how, as far as the country and the land are concerned, the wealth of the people is diminishing. We all know that when a man founds a family, or has aspirations to establish himself as a power in the land, the first thing he does is to take out a licence for armorial bearings. I daresay many noble Lords know that persons have taken armorial bearings which they were not entitled to take, but at any rate they have to pay something to the Exchequer. The number of armorial bearings taken out ten years ago was 56,792. In the year from 1907&#x2013;08 the number was 55,449. Take game licences. We were told by the late Prime Minister, of whom, of course, I speak with great respect, that England was to be a treasure house for the poor and not merely a pleasure house for the rich. There may have been some reason for saying that, but as far as I can make out the number of game licences issued has seriously diminished. The number in 1908&#x2013;09 was 73,885 as against 68,331 this year. That does not look as if England was entirely
<col>1284</col>
abandoned to shooting. Take the case of the railways. Every one knows there has been a great decrease in the number of first and even of second-class passengers. The reduction in the amount of railway passenger duty paid is very serious. In 1902&#x2013;3 &#x00A3;368,548 was paid, but last year it amounted to only &#x00A3;345,825. I have other figures, but I will not weary the House with them. But the effect of this Budget will be, I believe, to intensify and increase the poverty of some of the most worthy members of the community. It will certainly hit very hard all the owners of land. It will hit the small family and business man, and the ultimate effect of these five or six new taxes, whether they are on land or small businesses, will be to discourage the investment of capital in this country and also to hamper and harass existing concerns.<lb/>
The noble Lord who last spoke from the opposite Benches I remember used to give us words of wisdom in the House of Commons to which possibly we were sometimes deaf. He spoke of our going into this fight in light-hearted fashion. I do not think any one of us is going into it in light-hearted fashion. We realise the gravity and possible consequences of the Amendment. We are not light-hearted; but we are stout-hearted on this subject. There is a refrain which has gone up lately at meetings which has a great effect, I believe, upon audiences, Some gigantic person gets up at the back of the hall and asks, "Are we down-hearted?" and the reply is generally a yell of "No." Neither, my Lords, are we down-hearted. I have been fourteen years in the House of Commons and several years in this House, and I realise to the full extent the gravity of the step we propose to take to-night. But I shall certainly support the Amendment of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03687"><member>LORD GRIMTHORPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this debate ranges over three points of the most supreme importance. The first is whether the expenditure set forth in the Budget is justified; the second is whether the means proposed by the Government for meeting that expenditure are justified; and the third, which is the most important of all, is whether your Lordships' House is justified in rejecting the Budget, which provides the revenue by which the King's Government is carried on. Far too little in my opinion, has been said about expenditure.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0649"/>
<col>1285</col>
The expenditure is going up at a most alarming rate. The reign of extravagance began under the last Government. I confess I had hoped for better things under the present Government, but for the moment the word "retrenchment" seems to have dropped out of the Liberal vocabulary; and simultaneously with an increase of expenditure there is a reduction in the Sinking Fund. Charles Lamb was once reproached for coming late to business, and he replied, "Oh&#x0021;but you must remember I go away early." In the same way if the Government are reproached for spending too much they reply, "Oh&#x0021;but you must remember that we are saving too little." That does not seem to me very sound finance or such as would have been approved of by Mr. Peel or Mr. Gladstone. At the same time we must not forget that the total indebtedness of the country has been reduced by &#x00A3;40,000,000 under the present Government, whereas it was increased by &#x00A3;120,000,000 under the late Government. I am surprised that in all the speeches made during this debate from the opposite Benches no one has ever thought of attacking the expenditure, no voice has been raised in protest against the great and growing expenditure of this country. There are no economists apparently sitting upon the Benches opposite, and apparently not many upon these Benches either. But for all that it is expenditure which is the root of the evil, and unless it is attacked and controlled this country will be exposed to many and grave dangers. It is not necessary to defend the expenditure as it has not been attacked, so I will pass on to the next question.<lb/>
The expenditure has somehow or other to be provided for. New sources of revenue have to be tapped, and the question between us is this, whether under a system of Free Trade the burden is to fall largely upon capital, or whether under a system of Protection the burden is to fall mainly upon labour. That is the question which will have to be debated in this country. It is said that under the former system you are driving capital abroad and impoverishing the country and that under the latter system you would do away with unemployment and find work for all. As regards driving capital out of the country I think a good deal of the talk on that subject is mere moonshine. Capital is and always has been leaving
<col>1286</col>
this country, and I trust it will always continue to leave this country, for much of the great wealth and the enormous foreign commerce of this country is due to the very fact that the higher interest capital earns when invested abroad returns to this country in ever-fertilising streams and serves to provide new sources of wealth, to create new wealth and open out fresh sources of prosperity. I should have thought that this was a truism everybody would have recognised, certainly the great financiers who have addressed your Lordships' House. But really it seems to have come upon many people quite as a revelation. In <i>The Times</i> last Friday there was an article by the financial correspondent, who said&#x2014;
<quote>"The preference of investors for foreign securities becomes evidently due, in part at least, to a simple economic law, which impels the thrifty to put their money out to the best possible advantage."</quote>
It is a truism that capital will go where it can be most profitably employed, and that is why capital has been going out of the country. I commend to your notice another quotation from the same article. The writer said&#x2014;
<quote>"One of the causes of the comparative unpopularity of home investments arises from the necessity with which one of the great parties is faced of proving that we are on the road to irretrievable ruin."</quote>
It seems that according to this very pregnant statement many of those noble Lords who have been denouncing the Government for the outflow of capital from this country are themselves in a large measure responsible for the very evil which they deplore. In order to make out their case they have to prove what nobody except Lord Faber has attempted to prove, that British industries are starving for lack of capital; and even he, with all his experience, could only lay his finger upon two&#x2014;the railways and the building trade. It is a matter of notoriety that the railways are largely over capitalised, and it seems a strange remedy to say that you will cure the ills from which they are suffering by stuffing them with more capital when they are already suffering from a plethora of capital at this present moment. With regard to the building trade, we know that is always depressed when trade is depressed, and that it is one of the last to recover. We must not take a periodical symptom for a fixed permanent disease.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0650"/>
<col>1287</col>
Another point, on which I am sure my noble friend Lord Airedale can bear me out, is this, that in quoting these figures noble Lords on the other side entirely forget the vast sums that are put into British industries in providing new mills and machinery and in bringing plant up to date, and strengthening, improving and consolidating the brains and sinews of British trade and commerce. These vast sums are paid, and yet there is no record of them in statistics. I think anybody acquainted with the North of England knows perfectly well that no occasion for profitable enterprise is thrown away for lack of capital. How is it that capital does not pour into this country from foreign countries as our capital pours into theirs when there is a lack of it, and how is it when foreign Protectionist countries want capital and money it is to Free Trade England they come to find it? If you describe this Budget as revolutionary and Socialistic and as frightening away capital I want to ask you where the capital is going for greater security? Where can it find greater security than in England at the present moment? The prices of our Funds prove it up to the hilt. Our Funds stand higher in proportion to their rate of interest than the Funds of any other country of Europe. That is on account of the greater security they offer; people are prepared to take a smaller rate of interest on that account. That is the strongest proof you can have that there is no lack of security in England, and if capital is going away for greater security where is it going? That is an interesting question to have answered. Is it going to America, with its Trusts and panics and financial scandals in State legislation? Even the Standard Oil Company is not secure there. Is it going to the revolutionary Republics of South America, or to Russia with its <i>pogroms</i> and its bombs, or to France and Germany, where there are crises just as acute as here, financial crises of the most serious description?<lb/>
And with regard to the rise of Socialism which you so greatly fear here in England even a Tariff Reform paper wrote the other day pointing out that&#x2014;
<quote>"The by-elections for the Reichstag, the general elections for the State Parliaments, and the municipal elections in the towns and cities are yielding a staggering group of Red victories."</quote>
That is what you find in Germany. Capital will not go away to the extent you fear
<col>1288</col>
unless it can find much larger profit and perfectly good security. I would ask noble Lords opposite, and members of the Tory Party, to remember that it is quite possible to flaunt the flag of Socialism too freely before the electors of this country. Beware if by telling them that this Budget is blank, unmitigated Socialism you lead them to say "Well, if this is Socialism it is not so very terrible after all, and we don't know that it would be a bad thing if we had a little more of it." That is what you are leading them to. I believe the greatest propagandists in favour of Socialism at the present moment are Tariff Reformers. It is they, and those who describe the Budget as pure Socialism, who are making more Socialist converts than the Socialists themselves.<lb/>
If you say of this Budget, as Lord Curzon said, that it does not provide a cure for unemployment I would say it is not the business of the Budget to provide a cure for unemployment in the first place; and, in the second place, if you pile Ossa upon Pelion in the way of Protective Duties you will not get rid of unemployment which is inseparable from modern industrial civilisation. Look at all the Protectionist countries in the world, even America, with its vast resources and unlimited opportunities, where development is always going on and where there is necessarily a much greater demand for labour you would think at least than in this small old established country, where it is a perpetual miracle, due only to the beneficent operation of Free Trade, how such an enormous population crammed within such narrow confines can find so much to do and can live in such comparative case and comfort. But the question of unemployment is not really germane to the Budget. It is only put forward as a sort of stalking horse. Deeper reasons lie behind, deeper reasons which noble Lords do not attempt to conceal.<lb/>
In discussing this Budget I have been struck by the fact that during the whole of this debate not one single word has been said by noble Lords opposite against the indirect taxes which have been proposed by the Government. No, they fall on the labouring classes, and no protest is offered against them. No protest is offered against the taxes on food, tea, and tobacco. No, those who have to pay these taxes are left to look after themselves, and indeed many noble Lords who have spoken if they had their way would pile taxes on the poor
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0651"/>
<col>1289</col>
until nothing the working men eat would go into their mouths untaxed. But all their objurgations are reserved for the other taxes, the taxes which fall upon capital. I quite agree you may tax capital too high, but I do not know that it has yet been proved that capital is taxed too high under this Budget. Noble Lords should remember that Mr. Balfour admitted quite recently that if he came, into office he would be forced to continue the higher Income Tax, the Super Tax, and the higher Death Duties. Therefore by throwing out the Budget you do not get rid of those. You do not get rid of the indirect taxes, but you are, taking this extreme and perilous step to get rid of the Land and the Licensing Clauses which you detest; and by incurring these risks to get rid of the Land and the Licensing Clauses you are saying on the one hand that the community is not to take a moderate tithe of the value which it has created, and you are saying on the other hand that the sale of intoxicating liquors is not to be restrained by taxation. It seems a strange thing to make a political revolution for two such objects as those. I venture to say it will be indefensible. When you come before the country and join issue with the House of Commons on such a ground you are fighting with the sun in your eyes, and, moreover, I believe you are holding an empty pistol in your hand.<lb/>
I have followed this Debate with the greatest attention, and I confess I have not yet heard in any one of the speeches, eloquent and able speeches, which have been delivered a good and sufficient reason for violating the well-established practice and custom as it has existed for centuries and for making a political revolution. Lord Curzon, in his interesting speech to-night, practically admitted you were making a political revolution, for whether you succeed in maintaining your position or whether you are forced to abandon it things cannot remain as they have been. You have made that impossible. In consequence of your action the country is face to face with the question whether you are to govern the House of Commons or whether the House of Commons is to govern you. That is the question which, whether you like it or not, will be debated upon ten thousand platforms in the country, and I am very much afraid only one answer will be given, and that will be one unfavourable to your Lordships' House. This I deeply deplore because I am a strong and convinced Second
<col>1290</col>
Chamber man myself, and I believe in future we shall be exposed to dangers that will arise, not by reason of the strength of the Second Chamber but by reason of its weakness. Therefore I regret deeply to see it running the risk of being further weakened.<lb/>
In departing from the tradition of centuries in setting up a claim which, if it ever existed, has become obsolete through disuse, in rejecting the Budget sent up to you by an enormous majority of the accredited representatives of the people, in seeking to deprive the House of Commons of the exclusive control of the purse, you are entering a contest in which you must suffer much moral and intellectual damage. In forcing the election on this issue you are obliged to maintain that the House of Commons no longer represents the people. It was George II, I believe, who said to the elder Pitt&#x2014;
<quote>" Sir, you have taught me to look to the House of Commons for the sense of the people."</quote>
And if you do not find it there, where else are you to find it? If the House of Commons do not represent the people who, may I ask, do you represent? It is an utterly novel and absurd doctrine to maintain, as so many maintain now-a-days, that the true sense of the people is embodied in the minority and not in the majority of the House of Commons. If that doctrine were acted upon you would reduce Parliamentary Government to a farce. Last evening a noble Lord said Great Britain was not made for the Constitution but the Constitution for Great Britain. I quite agree with him, but at the same time it was not a sentiment I expected ever to hear delivered from the Tory Benches. We sit here by virtue of that Constitution, we enjoy our hereditary legislative rights by virtue of that Constitution, and if you tear the Constitution to pieces, upon what do you base your claim to make laws and exercise authority? Therefore it is a dangerous thing for us to tear great rents in the Constitution, inasmuch as it is on the Constitution our rights repose.<lb/>
Reference has been made by Lord Curzon to the very significant remark that proceeded from the Lord Chancellor on the first night of the debate, that in which he said no Liberal Government would ever take office again in England unless it was secure from a repetition of the treatment it had received during the last four years. I think that is a statement we must, whether we like it or
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0652"/>
<col>1291</col>
not, lay well to heart. For what does it amount to? It amounts to this, that when the people declare at the polls, whether at the forthcoming election or some subsequent election, that they want a Liberal Government in office, it means that they cannot have that Liberal Government in office, that their expressed wish and declaration cannot be carried out, unless your Lordships' House consents to part with some of its powers and privileges. If you decline to part with some of its powers and privileges then you say to the people, "You want to have a Liberal Government in office but we will not allow you to have it." Do you think the people of England are going to stand that? Therefore you are really exposing yourselves to the possible loss&#x2014;I say it without any intention to use the language of menace&#x2014;of some of your powers, to the possible curtailment of some of your privileges, and to the possible lowering of your political status and prestige. It is said "This cannot be; "some noble Lords have said" It is impossible, no one can touch us." Beware how you commit yourselves to that statement, for if you say no one can touch you, if you say no power exists in this State which can check your control, your powers, your privileges, which can modify or regulate your character and position, that you are in the State and not of it, that you are the one element in the body politic which remains immovable, unalterable, impervious to pressure above and from below, secure from attack, enjoying an immunity which is extended neither to the Crown nor to the popular House of the Legislature, it is a position you cannot take up and maintain, either in fact or argument. Therefore it is well that we should see what the consequences may be. You have said, and nobody doubts it, that when you laugh consequences to scorn you are not thinking of yourselves. No, in a matter of this I supreme importance I do not think we ought I to think of ourselves, but it is our bounden duty to think of this great, ancient, and historic House to which we belong. Nobody can deny that the House of Lords boasts a long, honourable, and splendid record; that it has played its part well in the history of England and rendered immense services to the country; and therefore it is with profound regret and grief and misgiving that every true friend of the House of Lords must watch your Lordships taking a step which will lower your dignity, impair your usefulness, and diminish your power for good in the State and Constitution of the realm.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1292</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03688"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not at this period of the debates have presumed to address your Lordships on this important matter if it were not for the fact that I am one of those who sit on this side of the House who are not in entire accord with the fiscal policy of those with whom we usually act. There have been pointed references made to the Free Traders in this House. I venture there fore, although my remarks will be very short, to say a few words with regard to my position and my views on the Bill which we are here to discuss. Let me say, in the first place, that I can at all events give some consolation to the noble Lord who has just addressed the House, and who began his remarks by deploring the extreme extravagance of the Government. I cordially concur in the remarks he made with regard to the extreme extravagance, not only of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but of the Government themselves.<lb/>
But what I wish to call attention to more especially is this. I am bound to say I am alarmed at what I may call the deliberate recklessness in which the Government enter into obligations without considering in any way how they are going to pay for them. I know what the answer from the Government will be&#x2014;that members on this side of the House have approved their policy of old age pensions and have pressed upon them repeatedly expenditure for naval affairs. In my opinion that is no answer to the question whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer is not able to so frame his Budget that he shall not put abnormal expediture upon a particular year. It seems to me that in this matter there has been recklessness because the cost of these pensions, however desirable they are and however much we may join in wishing to promote them, certainly was not considered fully before the Act was passed. It is for that reason we have to meet an expenditure this year abnormal and far beyond that of any year I can remember since I have had anything to do with public life. Consider what an example this is for local authorities. The enormous debt which is being piled up by the Government is not the only disagreeable feature of fiscal affairs at the present time. In the country local authorities are spending large sums of money on improvements, and their debts are increasing year by year to an enormous extent. Let me say that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0653"/>
<col>1293</col>
so far as the county councils are concerned I do not think they are yet corrupted by the evil example of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But I think there is a very real danger before us, and that it is much too common for public bodies of all sorts, whenever they have a particular policy they wish to carry out, some good work to complete which they think will be popular, not to consider how the cost can be brought within the ordinary expenditure of the year. So long as they chink it will be popular they get somewhat reckless with regard to finding the money for the purpose. Let me say that while I dislike that feature about the Budget, I also dislike intensely what I believe to be the injustice and unfairness of the Budget. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not for a moment say it is not a fair thing to put the taxes on those who are best able to bear them, but I have an impression that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has, in the form of his Budget, tried to penalise those interests which he has found are hostile to the Government.<lb/>
I said at the beginning of my speech that I wished to say something about the question of Free Trade. I am a Free Trader myself and have been all my life, and it is a sincere cause of pain and regret to me not to be able to follow my Party in the belief that the new policy which they have adopted&#x2014;Fiscal Reform and Protection&#x2014;will bring all the advantages to this country that they suppose. More than that, I believe that when that policy is carried out and there is a general system of Protection over the country, you will not be able to commend this policy to the working classes and especially to those people who, having a fixed income, have nothing to gain but everything to lose by a rise in prices. Much as I distrust the policy of Protection being adopted in this country I look upon the proposals of the Budget as a much more serious calamity to the country for the future than anything that can happen if Fiscal Reform is adopted; and as far as I am concerned I should not hesitate for a moment to accept the advice given me by my noble friend Lord Cromer and other Free Traders, that if we had votes at the coming election we should give them and our support to the Unionist-Party and do all we could to prevent many of the provisions of the Budget becoming law.<lb/>
<col>1294</col>
I should like to turn to another point. I am not going to presume to follow many of the speakers in the examination of the constitutional doctrines which they have made, but I should like to put before the House how the present position strikes me from a common sense point of view. I take it that we admit the Commons have the power of the purse, and as far as I have followed the speeches in this debate during the last week it is also admitted on both sides of the House that as the Budget must be passed by both Houses of Parliament there is an absolute legal right in this House to reject it if they think it is desirable or necessary to do so. I admit fully that that right is governed by the fact that it is a most unusual course to pursue, that it is very nearly without precedent, and that at all events it cannot be justified unless the circumstances are so unusual and so exceptional that it is necessary to make some use of this power in order to meet a real difficulty. Well, my Lords. I venture to submit that the question of "tacking," which I do not think has been so fully debated in this House as some of the others, is a most serious one for your Lordships to consider, particularly under the present circumstances. We know from the statements that have been made outside this House, and even within this House, that Ministers are desirous of limiting the power of the House of Lords by having some effectual means of stopping the veto upon all Bills that come before us. It seems to me somewhat ominous that we have in this Budget a provision dealing with a totally new policy, a policy which must be of the greatest importance to every member of the House and the country in general&#x2014;I mean the policy with regard to land. These provisions have been inserted in the Budget Bill so that any discretion or power of this House in saying either "Yes" or "No" to the Second Reading, or discussing their details, is absolutely taken away.<lb/>
What are the particular measures dealt with in this Bill? There are twenty-six clauses dealing entirely with the question affecting the novel taxation of land and the most elaborate machinery by which it is to be worked. Not only are there twenty-six clauses, but there are twenty-eight pages taken up by these clauses. Nearly a third of the Bill consists of these provisions, and, as has been pointed out
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0654"/>
<col>1295</col>
already by many speakers, they are of such an elaborate nature that it is almost impossible for any man of common sense to understand them, even if he has deeply studied the Bill. I would venture to ask what was the necessity of putting in this new policy with regard to land, because it is a new policy, with all the machinery that is necessary for carrying it out? It is not certain that it is going to bring anything to the revenue of the country for this year. Although there will be some small sums collected under these proposals the cost of the machinery which you are going to put in force even this year will be far greater than the funds you are going to raise for the purpose. Unless the Government had some deep design, why was it not possible to bring forward the proposals in an ordinary Bill which would have been submitted to the House, giving members the opportunity of considering the principle and the details? Then in some future years they could have brought forward the taxes which they considered necessary if the Bill passed into law.<lb/>
Notwithstanding some of the constitutional arguments by which it has been sought to prove that this is not a case of "tacking" I have not been converted to that view. I must say I consider this is a question of "tacking," and it is the most important part of the Bill which the House has to consider. Lord Curzon, who made such an eloquent speech a few hours ago, pointed out that this "tacking" was contested by this side of the House as much as, if not more than, other points of the Bill. I do not think, however, it has received quite the attention that I expected from those who have criticised the Bill from this side of the House. I think it is a very serious matter, and that we are justified in taking whatever steps we consider necessary to protect the privileges of this House against this usurpation which is proposed by preventing us from discussing the policy of a Bill of this sort. I regret, holding the views I do about this matter, that the Amendment of the noble Marquess does not contain any pointed allusion to "tacking" itself. There is no other Amendment before the House dealing with this matter. I do not for a moment set up my own judgment in any way or criticise in the slightest degree the judgment of those who have selected the
<col>1296</col>
particular words of the Amendment moved by the noble Marquess at the beginning of this debate, but I am, afraid the words, which he chose no doubt after considering all the difficulties of the situation, may be I open to be misrepresented in the country. It is already clear that some such misrepresentation is going on.<lb/>
It has been said by many authorities outside this House that the House of Lords are trying to make their House supreme, and the noble Viscount opposite, Lord Morley, I think went so far in his speech yesterday as to say that the effect of this Amendment, if it were carried, would be to make the House of Commons a "dummy." I cannot believe that any man in his heart believes that that can be either the intention or the effect of this Amendment if it is carried. I have no authority to speak for the views of the Front Benches on this side of the House or for the mover of the Amendment, but let me say for myself that in giving my vote for this Amendment, as I shall do, I vote for it because although I do not wish to interfere with the privileges of the other House in any way I do wish to assert that we also have our privileges. And it is for the purpose of protecting the privileges of this House, and in order to contest in every way the passing of the Budget into law, I for my part shall give my vote in favour of the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03689"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have heard a great deal in the course of this debate of an argument which is being pressed upon us with much reiteration, and that is that if we accept the Amendment which has been moved by the noble Marquess we at once place this House in a position which will render all future Liberal legislation impossible. We have been told this over and over again, first by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, who stated that no Liberal Government in future would be able to take upon itself the responsibility of assuming office. Then we were told in very sonorous phrases by the noble Marquess, Lord Northampton, that it was practically impossible for any Liberal legislation to be passed so long as the House of Lords acted as it does at the present moment. Unfortunately when we are told, as we are told repeatedly, that what is termed progress is practically impossible, sight seems to be altogether
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0655"/>
<col>1297</col>
lost of the legislation winch has been passed already. The noble Marquess, who emphasised this particular point so much the other night, seems to have entirely forgotten, for instance, the Trade Disputes Bill, which was passed in this House although we certainly disliked it, probably not quite so much as the Prime Minister and the then Attorney-General in another place. He has forgotten the Children Bill, the Town Planning Bill, and the Irish Land Bill, to which attention was drawn to-night; and it also seems to have escaped his notice that Ministers and supporters of the Government have on many occasions throughout the country since the General Election taken great credit for the amount of legislation that has been passed by the present Government. In 1907 the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>" The two years not yet wholly expired since the present House of Commons and the present Government that came into power have been years conspicuously and exceptionally fruitful both in the sphere of legislation and administration and largely beneficent reform."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03690">Is it not rather absurd for noble Lords to get up one after another and tell us that in the present constitution of your Lordships' House all Liberal legislation is impossible? I would suggest that those particular noble Lords and the noble Marquess, Lord Northampton, when they go upon the platforms of the country during the coming contest should slightly vary the tune, and instead of making use of this argument should ask the electors not to commit the deplorable error of dismissing a Government which has been capable of passing so much useful legislation.<lb/>
Then we had a speech the other evening from Lord St. David's, who occupies an important position in the City of London. He spent a great deal of time in arguing a point which none of us dispute for one minute&#x2014;namely that when foreign issues are made in this country, and more especially issues made by Governments in search of war material, and issues by foreign railways controlled in London, a great deal of the product of those industries benefits this country by way of trade and orders for material and plant. That is not what we complain of. That is not the point at all. When we speak of capital and investments leaving the country it is not so much the money which is subscribed for these foreign issues as the fact that people all over the place are investing their
<col>1298</col>
savings in buying foreign securities and foreign bonds instead of supporting long established British securities. I cannot see what possible good, what appreciable good, it can be to British trade that a man instead of purchasing Home Rails or some other well known British security should go into the market and buy American railroad bonds or bonds of some other security representing money long since spent. And when investors steadily refuse British securities the only possible result is their values must fall, to the very serious detriment of other issues which are required by those particular interests or other industrial concerns.<lb/>
But it is not so much the actual Budget itself of which we complain as frightening money out of the country, but the whole attitude of His Majesty's Government in supporting this Budget. As a humble director of one of the big London banks I can refer your Lordships to broker after broker in the City of London, and bank manager after bank manager, with whom I have conversed, and they will one and all tell you that clients and customers are constantly coming to them and asking their advice about a change of investments and always ending up with the same formula, "What do you recommend as safe, only nothing British?" I say it is a most unfortunate state of feeling to be prevalent in the country at the present moment. I can tell you of an instance of a friend of mine, a man who made a large fortune in the Colonies&#x2014;and people who are successful in Colonial speculation are not, as a rule, children in business&#x2014;who had the other day brought to his notice an English industrial enterprise in which he was invited to take a share. His reply was, "The business pleases me," and then he made use of this remarkable sentence&#x2014;
<quote>"Ever since Lloyd-George laid it down that nobody is entitled to what he has got except the man who has not got it, I have sold every English investment except my land, and don't intend to buy any more."</quote>
I am perfectly ready to admit that I think the interpretation which my friend placed upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer's words was somewhat exaggerated, so much so that I have been perfectly ready to risk what little I can afford myself in the enterprise which he would not touch. But what I do say is that it is most deplorable that even the most nervous of old ladies, let alone business men, should have these feelings
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0656"/>
<col>1299</col>
inculcated in their minds by the speeches of any British Chancellor of the Exchequer.<lb/>
Now we are waiting to see what is going to happen in the event of the vote of this House going in favour of the Amendment of the noble Marquess to-night. Great interest is being taken outside as to what the action of His Majesty's Government is going to be. We were told the other day by the President of the Board of Trade that the Government were going to "play the game." He said the present revival of trade may be checked by what he called the chaos that might result, and that seems a temptation to exploit the unemployment which may possibly result from commercial confusion. Whether His Majesty's Government are going to "play the game" or not we do not know, but judging by what fell from the Secretary of State for Scotland the other day and what we have seen in the public Press during the last few days it looks very much as if the wild men of the National Liberal Club were rather getting command of the situation. I have no doubt there are a great many temptations in that way at that temple of austerity where not very long ago, if they are not doing it now, they were spending &#x00A3;700 or &#x00A3;800 a year in salary to their cook. There it stands on the Embankment, the Embankment which is the marshalling place of political processions, and I can well understand that, judged from the results of last Thursday's demonstration and the questionable characters who appeared in the Police Courts on the following day, the gentlemen in the National Liberal Club would want something more solid and something more respectable from political demonstrations in future. It would suit their books admirably if there were some confusion of trade and some increase in unemployment in order that we might have some more processions on the Embankment which might be safely hounded against the House of Lords. All I can say is that if through mere political spite the extremists who support His Majesty's Government do get the upper hand in this matter and do manage to prevent the Government doing anything, which they certainly can do, to prevent temporary inconvenience arising, if they do deliberately set to work to cause confusion of trade at this particular time at the beginning of winter which very likely would interfere with employment, I think it will be a piece of heartless indifference and will not be relished by the country at large.<lb/>
<col>1300</col>
Before I sit down I want to make an appeal to the noble Earl who leads the House. In his opening speech the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, said that he hoped the noble Earl opposite would in his speech to-night give us some real indications, straightforward indications, as to what are the intentions of the Government with regard to the question of land nationalisation, which, however you may wrap it up and however you may disguise it, is undoubtedly at the back of the mind of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The question was raised in this House a few months ago by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, when he called attention to the speeches of the Lord Advocate and the fact of his having said that&#x2014;
<quote>" This modest-looking tax involved a principle of far-reaching application, a principle which they believed to be sound and safe but which the bulk of their political opponents equally strongly denied. The principle was that the land as distinct from the buildings erected upon it and the improvements made upon it in truth belonged to the nation."</quote>
We know what that means. The noble Earl gave at the time one of those enigmatical answers of which he is such a master. The noble Earl has reduced the art of disguising his opinions when he does not want to answer an inconvenient question in a way that excites the admiration of all on one side of the House and must consume noble Lords opposite with bitter envy. There is no one in this House who is better able to get up, and in suave and urbane tones make a speech of half an hour and then sit down without having said anything at all than is the noble Earl. But we want to have something a little more definite than that. It is all very well to say that, in a Cabinet like the present one, which is composed largely of fire-brands, the more moderate members cannot be held responsible for the occasional sparks which fly from those fire-brands. But the speeches of the Lord Advocate are not occasional sparks. They were matters of daily occurrence. It was evidently a calculated part of the campaign in support of the Government, and day after day the Lord Advocate went about the country preaching this particular doctrine of land nationalisation. I do ask your Lordships to say that the time has gone by for these enigmatical phrases of the noble Earl, and that the matter has become too serious, and that we have a right to know exactly where we are and what the views of the Government really are upon this matter.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0657"/>
<col>1301</col>
There are only two alternatives. Either this united Government that we hear so much about is so hopelessly divided amongst itself that the moderate members of it are absolutely incapable of controlling the extremists, or, if that is not the case, I submit they will have to plead guilty to the somewhat discreditable political tactics of deliberately using these means for obtaining votes on a subject which can be disowned if it is found convenient. I make this appeal to the noble Earl because I feel it is one of the most important matters connected with this Budget. It is one of the great innovations of principle to which we on this side take objection, and we hope the noble Earl will deal with it in an open and straightforward way when he winds up the debate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03691"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when this Budget was first introduced I confess I hoped the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition might be able to advise those who follow his lead to sanction its passage into law. I knew he would be bound to tell us that in his opinion it was a very bad measure, that it was based on unsound financial principles, that it proposed to use capital as income, and that it selected certain interests whose owners were supposed to be chiefly opposed to the policy of the Government for vexatious and unfair taxation. I hoped he might; have told us that neither he nor any leaders of the Unionist Party would take one jot or tittle of responsibility for those obnoxious provisions, and moreover that they bound themselves, should they be returned to power at the next Election, to take the quickest possible steps to cancel them, but that in the meantime, in view of the fact that within two years the Government must go to the country to give an account of their stewardship, he would not advise your Lordships to refuse the supplies necessary for carrying on the government of the country. This, I am sure, is what the noble Marquess would have liked to have done; but as the Budget was studied more, as its imperfections were day by day discovered, it became apparent that this course was impossible.<lb/>
Here may I digress one moment to say how fortunate I think it is that the Opposition members of your Lordships' House should have at the present time as leader the noble Marquess, whom not even his political opponents can describe as a
<col>1302</col>
bigoted and crusted Tory. The noble Marquess is the head of a great Liberal house, his ancestors have done yeoman service in the past for the Liberal cause, he has been nurtured and brought up in Liberal traditions, and has been a member in a Liberal Administration under no less a Liberal than Mr. Gladstone. We know in this matter his opinion is based on that breadth of vision which comes from lifelong association with the leaders of both great Parties in the State.<lb/>
I think we all agree that we should not have thought of taking the step which we are now taking merely because we object to one or two particular taxes in this Finance Bill. Our action must be based on higher motives. The Lord Chancellor told us that in his opinion your Lordships had a legal right but not a constitutional right to reject the Bill. I think the reason we are taking this step is that in our opinion the action of the House of Commons in this matter, although it may be perfectly legal, has not been constitutional. It is because we think they are attempting to infringe the privileges of your Lordships' House. I am quite aware that the "tacking" of these clauses of the Bill has been manipulated in a very skilful manner so as to afford those who wish to defend them the plausible excuse that they are necessary in order to carry out the financial provisions but fortunately some exuberant members of the Liberal Party let the cat out of the bag when they were annoyed at your rejecting various measures they had put forward, and they openly said they intended to re-introduce the measures between the leaves of a Finance Bill in order that your Lordships should not be able to reject them. This, I think, is in itself quite sufficient reason why the Budget should be rejected.<lb/>
There is another. If you look at the preamble you will see this Bill is entitled an Act to make provision for the financial arrangements of the year. I do not think any of the noble Lords opposite will tell me that the Land Clauses make any provision for the financial arrangements of this year. I believe it is calculated that they will bring in &#x00A3;200,000 this year, and the cost of the valuation will be precisely the same. But we must not forget that under the Land Clauses a change in Schedule A was made which will reduce the amount, and besides this there will be a grant to local authorities of &#x00A3;300,000.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0658"/>
<col>1303</col>
Therefore, instead of providing for the financial arrangements of the year it results in a loss of &#x00A3;600,000.<lb/>
The third reason is, it seems to me, that if the Kill is passed it will be impossible to return to sounder methods of finance. It has been pointed out by more than one noble Lord that if we assume the new interests created under it it will be impossible ever afterwards to get rid of them. I cannot help thinking that the position of your Lordships' House with regard to the Finance Bill is the same as that of a specialist who is called in to consult with the family practitioner. We all know what he says in the majority of cases. After a consultation, of the details of which we know nothing, the great man comes in, and as he pockets his fee says, "I think the patient is going on as well as possible. I cannot leave him in better hands than those of our friend Dr. So-and-So." That is the course your Lordships generally adopt. But it sometimes happens that the specialist gives another verdict. He says, "I find it impossible to approve of the <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> of Dr. So-and-So; you must choose between him and me." Instead of giving the patient a little more quinine and rhubarb he has gone in for the new school of medicine, and proposes to dose him with prussic acid, it is true in small doses, but with the avowed intention of increasing them afterwards. Here is a case in which your Lordships say, "We totally disagree. We must refer the matter to the friends of the patient"&#x2014;in this case the electors of the country.<lb/>
I should like to say a few words about a most interesting speech we listened to the other night from the noble Earl the Lord Steward, who devoted himself to showing how very reasonable the taxes proposed in the Bill were. He had actually prepared a paper showing how they would fall on estates of different sizes. I should like to deal with the estate of &#x00A3;1,000,000, not to ask you to pity the sorrows of the poor millionaire. You will remember it was suggested that at three per cent. it would bring in &#x00A3;30,000 a year gross. The Income Tax, Super Tax and Death Duties, the noble Earl said, would come to &#x00A3;9,096, about thirty per cent. of the whole income; but he omitted to say there were other taxes to which the property would be liable. I do not know exactly how the new Land Duties would fall on it. It may be liable for the
<col>1304</col>
Undeveloped Land Duty, and there may be a five per cent. Mineral Royalty Duty. The owner would naturally have to pay Inhabited House Duty and so forth. Then there are the large rates on a property of &#x00A3;30,000 a year, and I submit that the result would be that there would not be enough money to keep up the property properly, and consequently there would be an increase of unemployment by the dismissal of many of those who had hitherto been working on the property. I know quite well that this does not weigh equally heavily in the case of property other than land. I met a rich supporter of His Majesty's Government the other day who said&#x2014;
<quote>" I really do not think this Budget is so bad. The only difficulty is about the Super Tax, but I think I have arranged that. I am going to send the greater part of my money abroad. I receive a certain amount as a director of public companies, and what I want besides I shall manage to arrange by spending the capital which I still have in this country."</quote>
I do not say that I hope that gentleman will be able to defeat the tax-gatherer because I think we ought to be prepared to pay our share of what is necessary for the country, but I do say that taxation which results in people who have hitherto paid what the State claims from them now trying to evade it in this way cannot really be good or sound.<lb/>
Before I sit down I should like to say one word about the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery. I think we are all agreed that your Lordships looked forward with the greatest interest to that speech. But I think I must say that I, for one, was disappointed with it. I do not mean to say that I was disappointed with it as an oratorical achievement. To listen to the noble Earl is always an intellectual treat, and his speech on the present occasion was no exception to the rule. But what did the noble Earl say? He denounced the Budget in language which I think he alone is capable of employing. But his conclusion was that although it was so bad he would wait for something worse before he voted for a Resolution like that of the noble Marquess, and he ended up by saying that he wished to make a practical suggestion. I do not know if I was wrong, but it seemed to me there was a hush of expectation over your Lordships' House when he uttered those words. We all waited to hear what would follow. Now, it was thought, there will be a settlement of this question; now we shall know how this constitutional crisis can be
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0659"/>
<col>1305</col>
avoided. The practical suggestion was made, and what was it? It was that the Unionist Peers were to assemble, and by resolution decide, without the consent of the Commons and without the consent of the Crown, that the Report of the Committee on the Reform of the House of Lords, over which the noble Earl presided, should, for the purposes of this Bill alone, have the force of law. My Lords, I think that proposal not only not a practical one, but one which is neither legal nor constitutional. Mark, my Lords! The Bill was still to be thrown out by this majority and the rest of your Lordships were to stand huddled on the steps of the Throne declaring to the country that you thought yourselves incompetent to take part in so grave a crisis. The responsibility which falls on us as one of the Estates of the Realm cannot thus be delegated. We each must bear that responsibility for ourselves, whether our name is a household word like that of the noble Earl or whether we are what Radical newspapers describe as "backwoodsmen." It seems to me that the question we have to decide is not whether this is the most favourable battleground on which we can fight, not whether we are doing what is best for the House of Lords, but whether in our opinion this Budget is injurious to the country. Believing as I do that it is revolutionary and that its effects will be disastrous, I for one shall have no hesitation in voting for the Amendment of the noble Marquess. I am sure that our friends will approve of our action, and that even those who are opposed to us will acknowledge, even if we are mistaken, that we have been actuated in what we are doing by unselfish and patriotic motives.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03692"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have intruded at all upon your Lordships' time but for the fact that I desire to speak upon a subject raised last night by Lord James of Hereford and supplemented by the speech of the Archbishop of York. The noble and learned Lord last night claimed that there was no "tacking" in this Bill. I may confess at once that had I not been convinced that this Bill does include "tacking" I should vote for the Budget, but after a careful and prolonged consideration of the provisions of this Bill I emerged I absolutely convinced that it does contain the most pernicious principle of "tacking," which it is the bounden duty of your Lordships' House to resist at its initial stages. The noble and learned Lord turned to the
<col>1306</col>
noble Marquess on the Front Bench and appealed to him, as it seemed to me, that as his Amendment contained no reference to "tacking" therefore there was no complaint that there was "tacking" in this Bill, and that, consequently, no objection could be raised upon that point. It seems to me that the noble and learned Lord and the right rev. Prelate are landed in this fallacy. If they insist upon that, then in regard to a subject upon which your Lordships are better qualified to speak than the other House, or upon which, at any rate, your Lordships have a very wide experience&#x2014;that of the valuation of land&#x2014;it will be permissible to "tack" that on to a so-called Finance Bill and it will be improper for your Lordships, contrary to usage, to put in a single Amendment upon those valuation clauses, which are, in effect, a Valuation Bill. I repudiate the suggestion, and I insist that it is the bounden duty of this House to resist at its initial stages the suggestion that such a thing as that can be done.<lb/>
I object to the Bill on financial grounds. I think it contains in it elements of the most unsound finance. I think it is unjust in that it selects certain classes of property for special taxation to the advantage of other classes of property. I think it is dangerous because, it goes too far in the taxation of capital, and I think it is stupid because the money could have been raised without creating all the animus that has been created and causing the trouble that has been given to another place, and without creating all the disturbance that has been brought about in the country. But I should not have opposed it on those grounds. I should have voted for the Budget but for the fact that it does contain this principle of tacking. I have not been influenced in the vote that I shall give by my conviction that this quarrel has been forced upon your Lordships deliberately, coolly, and calmly by His Majesty's Ministers. We have heard several speeches from noble Lords on the other side of the House accusing your Lordships of having forced this crisis upon the country. What a parody of innocence that is. It has been one of the chief planks in the Government's platform during the last four years that they would attack the land, the trade, and the House of Lords. From the first speech of the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in the Albert Hall four years ago it was evident to anybody who studied politics that that was the strategy of the opposite Party. In the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0660"/>
<col>1307</col>
course of that speech Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman used the memorable expression that what had been the pleasure ground of the rich should be the treasure ground of the poor." Pleasure ground of the rich! "Why, one of the original intentions of the Bill was to tax every pleasure ground in the country whether it belonged to the poor or the rich. And the "treasure ground of the poor" indeed! Well, we have had an <i>expos&#x00E9;</i> in the last few days of what the intentions of the Government are if they carry out their idea of the nationalisation of land. We have had it in the true story of the estate belonging to the Duke of Bedford, and of what was the intention of the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture who, I regret to hear, is too unwell to be in his place. As soon as the Government had obtained this property which was going to introduce the system of the nationalisation of land, what were they going to do? To put up the rent. But not daring to face his colleagues in the Cabinet, the noble Earl proposed that the Duke of Bedford should put up the rents before conveying the property to Government. That will be a pretty story to tell in the country of what the intentions of the Government are as regards the future possession of land by Government&#x0021;The first principle of all will be to put up the rent.<lb/>
Another expression that has been constantly in their months is that they were going to "fill up the cup." They have been "filling up the cup" gradually, deliberately, these last four years, and now, with great care and adroitness, they have "filled up the cup" to overflowing. I suggest to your Lordships that their tactics have been extremely adroit. They have chosen the ground, they have chosen the place, they have chosen the question upon which the issue of the battle is to be decided, and they have man&#x0153;uvred so well that they are in the position of attacking while we are in the position of having to defend. I compliment them upon their tactics; they have been extremely adroit. But there is something behind tactics. There is strategy, and I question very much whether their strategy will prove to be as wise as they hope. I touch upon no more questions involved in the Budget and I conclude with this remark. I have been nearly forty years in your Lordships' House. I have given many votes upon important measures and upon important questions. I have
<col>1308</col>
never given a vote yet with such a consciousness of the responsibility that rests upon me as I do upon this. The privilege of attending such a debate as this&#x2014;a debate which for its honesty of purpose, its solemnity of tone, and its conscientiousness of principle must, whatever the opinions are in the country, add lustre to the annals of your Lordships' House&#x2014;the privilege of attending this debate is an honourable heritage. To have the responsibility of giving a vote on this question is a heavy burden. But I have never given a vote in this House with such conviction that I am right in doing so as I do now. I give it in the solemn conviction that I am doing it for the honour and traditions of my order, for the honour and the traditions of this House; but, far more, I am convinced that I am giving it for the safety of the people, whose liberties your Lordships' House as part of the Constitution of the country have the right and the duty to defend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03693"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD STANMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Grimthorpe, has dwelt largely, as other members of the House have done, although I think not quite so emphatically, upon what he called the "unbroken practice of centuries." Almost the only reason which induces me to trouble you to listen for a few moments to so unimportant a person as myself is that I wish to give to you an instance which I think has not been given yet in your Lordships' House to prove the contrary of that proposition. What my noble relative Lord Balfour of Burleigh said the other night is perfectly true&#x2014;that is to say, there is an unformed constitutional practice which is generally understood although it may not be in exact accordance with law and precedent. That is perfectly true; the popular feeling as to what are the rights, functions, and duties of this House and also of the other House of Parliament have varied and will vary from time to time without any formal change in their legal position. There are two periods which, as regards financial matters, are widely different&#x2014;the period before 1860 and the period after that year. Before 1860, whatever may have been the case since, though it is not strictly legal or even strictly constitutional, the understanding was this, that Money Bills, being Money Bills alone and dealing only with finance, were, as a matter of course, accepted by your Lordships' House. But when a Money Bill
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0661"/>
<col>1309</col>
comprehended great public interests, great social questions, the rights of important authorities, it was debated and divided on just as any other Bill.<lb/>
The instance I wish to mention to your Lordships is that of the Maynooth Act of 1845. That Bill was a Money Bill from beginning to end. Its sole object was to increase the grant made by the Government to the College of Maynooth and to augment the salaries of the professors and teachers belonging to it. That is clearly a Money Bill, but it was felt, and generally felt, that it was a measure which deeply concerned the Catholics and Protestants of Ireland, which deeply concerned the whole welfare of that country. The whole Irish question centred around it at the time, and consequently it was debated and divided upon in your Lordships' House exactly as any other Bill would have been. I was present at that debate. This House debated it for three successive nights, and although the Bill was carried there was a very large minority against it. That was in 1845, In the following year, 1846, this House had before it the great Corn Law Repeal Bill. That was a Finance Bill. It was a Bill for the removal of certain duties which had been levied up to that date, but it never occurred to Sir Robert Peel or to any member of the Opposition of that day in the House of Commons that that great measure could be effected simply by the repeal of the Duty being put into the clauses of a Finance Bill. It was debated in both Houses of Parliament as the great measure and the great reform that it was. Since 1861 the case has been different. The inclusion of all finance measures in one Bill has made it, as Mr. Gladstone said, more difficult, not impossible, to reject them, and rejection would never have been resorted to had not your Lordships perceived how powerful a weapon in the hands of an unscrupulous Government would be the admission that whatever they chose to cover with the sanctity of a Money Bill must pass without demur.<lb/>
Like those noble Lords who are among the ablest and best speakers and most respected members of the Opposition, and who abstain from voting, I am a convinced Free Trader. I share their suspicion of Tariff Reform and their abhorrence of a protective duty, but I cannot follow them in the action which they recommend. I should be inclined to say, especially to the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, who so earnestly, I
<col>1310</col>
might almost say pathetically, entreated Free Traders and Tariff Reformers to unite together for the defence of this House, the maintenance of which he has said, and said truly, is of greater importance than the mere details of the Budget&#x2014;I would ask him whether he does not perceive that his action will have far more effect in the country than his preaching. His abstinence from a vote in this House to-night will be the signal for the absence of thousands of Conservative Free Trade voters from the polls in the country, and thereby may bring about the very disaster and catastrophe he so earnestly desires to avoid.<lb/>
I think a great deal of breath has been wasted in this debate in asserting over and over again the privileges of the Commons. No one questions them. No one doubts that the Commons alone can grant Supplies. It is admitted as freely on the Opposition Benches as on the Ministerial side of the House. We are not taking this action because we wish to take away anything from the privileges of the Commons. The real cause of this debate and Division is the fact that from the time, four years ago, when His Majesty's Government took office we have had notice that it was the intention of the Government to make a serious attempt to diminish the privileges of this House. They told us, some in honeyed tones, others of them in very violent tones, that we were to be reduced practically to the position of a Court of Registry of the decrees of the House of Commons. My Lords, I have lived a good deal in tropical countries, and I have seen there a small bee which provides for its family in an ingenious manner. It deposits its egg in a cell and along with the egg it deposits a spider for the grub to eat when it comes out of the egg. By a marvellous process it injects into the spider a fluid which at once has the property of absolutely paralysing every faculty of the spider but at the same time keeping it alive. The fate of that spider is the fate which His Majesty's Government intend for us; we are to be kept alive to maintain our present disabilities as to voting and representation, but absolutely impotent for any useful purpose. It is a fate which I trust we shall not come to. I would rather see this House destroyed than degraded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03694"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this time in the debate I do not propose to inflict on your Lordships any effort on my part to pass
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0662"/>
<col>1311</col>
through all the many subjects that have been discussed, and discussed, may I say, with marked ability and in a very high tone; but I hope, your Lordships will allow me to pass in review as shortly as I can some few of the main issues which to my mind should demand the thoughtful attention of the country with respect to the controversy in which we are engaged.<lb/>
First of all, with regard to your Lordships' right to reject a Bill of this kind, I would venture to remind your Lordships of the point with which my noble friend Lord Curzon dealt with so much skill in that great speech he has delivered to-night&#x2014;the point that in past years each tax in this Finance Bill came up contained in its own Bill, and your Lordships had then the undoubted and unquestioned right of rejecting each Bill and therefore each tax. Since that there has been an attempt to evade the rights of your Lordships' House, and with that intention all taxes are placed in one Bill. But surely it is idle to contend that any change of procedure in another place such as that can affect by one iota your Lordships' rights, responsibilities, and duties. I will claim as far as that is concerned that your Lordships' rights and responsibilities remain exactly as they were, that you have to-day, as you had then, an absolute right over each tax as you had then over each Bill and each tax. We are told, again, that this right has not been exercised for many years. Does it not occur to many of us that the mere statement that a right has not been exercised of itself recognises and admits the possibility of the right being exercised?<lb/>
I pass on to the views of many distinguished leaders of the Liberal Party on this question of your Lordships' rights. First of all there is the well-known statement of Mr. Gladstone. I was rather struck by a passage in the speech last night of the noble Viscount on the Front Bench opposite&#x2014;to whose speech we all listened with the utmost pleasure and admiration. Indeed, it is impossible for the noble Viscount to make a speech in any assembly that is not listened to with admiration by his fellow-countrymen. What attracts one, however, to the noble Viscount is the desperate honesty of his speech and of his convictions. The noble Viscount ventured to give an explanation as to Mr. Gladstone's statement which seemed to me to be curious. It was that those who knew Mr. Gladstone best perhaps best appreciated that after he had heard all the arguments on a subject, no one ever knew on
<col>1312</col>
which side of the fence he was likely to come down.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03695"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACK-BURN)</member><membercontribution>: Beforehand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03696"><member>EAEL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I quite appreciate that. No one ever knew beforehand on which side of the fence he was likely to come down. It is not for me to say whether that criticism is accurate or not, but I cannot help wondering what would have been said if such a criticism had been made from this side of the House. I think that if we had made a statement of that kind we should have received not very easy treatment from the noble Viscount if he had followed us in debate. Then we had quoted to us the statement of Lord Spencer, another Liberal leader highly esteemed on both sides of the House. Next we had Lord Ripon. I remind the Lord Chancellor, however, that the statement of Lord Ripon in 1896 was that as far as the rejection of the Bill was concerned your Lordships in your rejection were absolutely within, not your legal, but your constitutional rights.<lb/>
I have one more witness I should like to call. I find that in 1894 the present Prime Minister made a speech to his constituents in Scotland. He spoke then with all the responsibility of one who held high office. Speaking on the subject of the House of Lords, he said&#x2014;
<quote>" The functions which are claimed for the House of Lords are merely these:&#x2014;First of all, that it should act as a revising authority over the details of legislation; and, in the next place, where there is a reasonable doubt whether upon-any question the House of Commons is representing the majority of the electorate the House of Lords should have the power of interposing such delay as will enable that doubt to be authoritatively closed."</quote>
I beg your Lordships to notice that there is no qualification as to the question, no qualification as to the Bill. Mr. Asquith went on to say of the House of Lords that its business&#x2014;
<quote>" is to correct slovenly and to check precipitate legislation; but it must be keen to watch and careful to follow the steady set, as distinguished from the transient drift, of national sentiment, and it must be always ready to defer to the clear manifestation of the popular will; and that is the ideal House of Lords."</quote>
That was a speech delivered by the Prime-Minister after he had succeeded to office, and not as an independent man. I do not know what the noble Earl who leads the;
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0663"/>
<col>1313</col>
House will tell us, but I think this view fairly represents the attitude which your Lordships are proposing to adopt to-night.<lb/>
I am inclined to take my stand on this subject very much from the point of view at which, as I think, the "man in the street" will look at it. The "man in the street" is not going to discuss the varieties of the law and the Constitution; but he will find that this Bill which comes up to your Lordships' House every year is a Bill that without your approval and assent cannot become law. Yet we are told that this is a Bill with which we have nothing to do. Will any man of commonsense&#x2014;and the "man in the street" is supposed to be a man of commonsense&#x2014;accept the view that a Bill which comes before your Lordships, that cannot without your Lordships' assent and advice become law, is a Bill on which you can only express one view&#x2014;that assent only is possible and dissent; is barred? It is an incredible and impossible position to take up&#x2014;impossible, at all events, to the commonsense men in the country. If it be the fact, then for generations past we have been enacting year by year nothing more nor less than a solemn farce.<lb/>
My Lords, what will be the effect of giving way? You are invited to deal this year with a Licensing Bill. You are asked to deal with land values. Both those Bills have been brought before Parliament by the Government themselves, and brought before Parliament as the right way of dealing with these questions&#x2014;that is, as ordinary Bills. There was no question as to which was the right way to deal with them; there was no suggestion that they were not proper subjects for your Lordships to deal with. Then when your Lordships do deal with them, and they fail to pass, the Government say, We will tack them on to the Budget, and your Lordships will not be able to touch them. Do noble Lords opposite really suggest that it is possible for any Second Chamber to sit down under conditions such as these? Do they suggest that, if they did, such a Chamber would be worthy of the confidence and the respect of the people of this country?<lb/>
My Lords, we are told this is a bad case to tight. Can we conceive a better&#x2014;a case in which your Lordships have had put before them deliberately by the Government as the right way of solving certain legislative questions, certain Bills, and when they fail
<col>1314</col>
in that direction the Government place the same proposals in the Budget, and your Lordships are defied to touch them. We hear a good deal about picking the quarrel, and trying to force the issue. Is it not pretty clear where the pressure has come from and who has tried to seek the quarrel? If, my Lords, you are persuaded to-night, as I hope you will not be, to pass this Bill, you will have done one tiling, and done it by your own hand&#x2014;you will have destroyed for ever all power in the Second Chamber of this country.<lb/>
We have received a great deal of advice from our friends&#x2014;friends for whom we have the deepest regard, men of the highest standing and the greatest eloquence. I speak of everything they have advised us with the greatest respect. I recognise they are all men of the highest integrity, whose sole wish is to deal with this emergency in the manner they think best in the interests of the country. What is their advice? They tell us the Bill is bad. They tell us it is a revolution. They tell us it is dangerous to the best interests of the people of this country. And yet they tell us&#x2014;Let it pass. We are told, again, that the stakes we are playing for are too high. We are to stand aside. I cannot reconcile such a course of action with the responsibility your Lordships owe to the people of this country. I am unable to believe that, whether the course be dangerous or not, where responsibility rests upon us we can ever afford to stand aside.<lb/>
We are told that the people are to stew in the juice of the Budget for some months. My noble friend Lord Curzon pointed out that it might be for several years. But, in any case, surely it is perfectly clear that the object of a Second Chamber is not to let the people stew in the juice of undesirable legislation. It is to guard the people from unwise, dangerous, and extravagant legislation being passed. It is before the legislation is passed that a Second Chamber can be of any use. If it is to begin to think about what is to be done after the legislation is passed, I think the country will very soon come to the conclusion that they can do without the Second Chamber as well as with it. We are told the stakes are too high. We are told that we do not know what the consequences are. Is it not patent that that argument can only have one meaning, and that is that, if we are to hesitate to-day, we are hesitating simply
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0664"/>
<col>1315</col>
and solely from fear, fear of the consequences to ourselves, aye, and possibly fear of the consequences to the country. But, my Lords, I cannot believe that we need trouble, much as to the consequences. So long as we are perfectly satisfied in our own mind, bearing in mind our responsibilities to the country, that we are doing right, we can afford to let the consequences take case of themselves.<lb/>
Then we are told that we are going to cause chaos in finance. I do not know how long that chaos is supposed to last, but from all the accounts that reach us it does not seem that it need last very long before a General Election has, at all events, settled who is to be responsible in the future for the finance of the country. But my noble friend Lord Lansdowne the other day stated that, if legislation were needed to avoid chaos or inconvenience in finance, he pledged himself on behalf of those who sit on this side of the House that we would render every assistance, that we could to prevent anything of the kind taking place. The Secretary for Scotland did not give a very cordial welcome to that suggestion. I do not suppose the noble Earl who leads the House will be any more cordial to it to-night, but I am here to repeat the offer of my noble friend and to note just this. If His Majesty's Government themselves can avoid any inconvenience and anything approaching chaos, well and good. I have nothing more to say. But if they cannot, without legislation, avoid chaos and they decline to avail themselves of a perfectly easy solution of their difficulties, then the chaos, if it comes, rests on the shoulders of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, a few words as to the Budget itself. We have been told on the highest authority that it will have far-reaching political and social results. No one, I think, doubts it. The Socialists acclaim it. They take it as the first step in their own programme. When Ministers of the Crown and noble Lords on the other side speak of the Budget it entirely depends on the audience they are addressing as to whether they describe it as harmless or Socialistic. But there is no doubt whatever in any case of the wide scope of the Budget, politically and socially. It has drawn away capital from this country to an alarming extent. That has been attempted to be denied, but I think that any one who listened to the speeches of my
<col>1316</col>
noble friends Lord Revelstoke, Lord Avebury, Lord Faber, and last, but not least, Lord Rothschild, will find it difficult to answer the statements made by those noble Lords. It has stunned and dislocated the building trade, it has already increased the want of employment, and it must increase it more. The distress of working-men must follow in the steps of this Budget, and "The Poor Man's Budget" means the creation of many many more of the very poor.<lb/>
And, meanwhile, His Majesty's Government propose to spend large sums of money, not in obtaining large sums for this year's supplies, but in speculating as to what they may be able to get in future years. And can we say honestly and fairly that they have made proper provision for the defence of the country? I wish with all my heart I could say I believed it was so. But I believe that, when it comes to our time to discuss again the position of the Navy and the Army, we shall find that the only economies which were made by His Majesty's Government have been those which may tend to the danger of the country itself. Our claim is that this far-reaching political and social Budget is one as to which the people have a right to have their say. The people must be masters in this matter in their own house, and they must be masters, too, of an autocratic Government.<lb/>
I want to say a word or two with regard to the origin and parentage of this Budget. We have heard a good deal of the great labours that have been bestowed upon it by His Majesty's Ministers and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I do not for a moment question that, but it is somewhat significant that a pamphlet should have been issued early in this year entitled "A Few Hints to Lloyd-George. Where is the Money to Come From? The Question Answered." My Lords, this pamphlet sets I out very clearly what, in the view of the writer, was a method by which the taxation of the year should be raised. It says that&#x2014;
<quote>" at a special conference on taxation recently held by the Labour Party at Portsmouth, a resolution was unanimously passed which set forth the ideas of the Party on the general question of taxation, and also formulated the financial demands for which the Party must press in the present session of Parliament."</quote>
This part of the pamphlet is headed "Socialism and the Coming Budget." It
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0665"/>
<col>1317</col>
passes on to say that the Prime Minister said in October last&#x2014;that is October, 1908&#x2014;
<quote>" There is a large reservoir of possible taxation and resources which have never been drawn upon adequately and justly."</quote>
Then it says&#x2014;
<quote>" The Government must now draw upon this reservoir, and we will proceed to suggest how and to what extent they can do this."</quote>
It then suggests four ways of raising new taxes. Your Lordships will note that each of them has been introduced in the Budget of this year. They suggest a Super Tax, they suggest the taxation of monopolies by the increase of Licence Duties, they suggest increased Death Duties, and they suggest land values taxation. They go further. In regard to the Super Tax they say&#x2014;
<quote>" For a beginning it might be advisable to start on incomes of &#x00A3;5,000."</quote>
Curiously enough, that is the very sum fixed by the Budget. They say&#x2014;
<quote>" It is not an excessive Super Tax upon such incomes, and the relief to incomes between &#x00A3;2,000 and &#x00A3;5,000 cannot be defended except as a temporary respite until the new system has been got into working order, when it will be easy gradually to descend with the Super Tax."</quote>
In regard to the taxation of land values the writer says&#x2014;
<quote>" I do not for a moment wish to convey the idea that taxation of land values will solve the land problem. It will not do that; but it will be the means by which the community can get back a little of its own in the meanwhile."</quote>
The writer then expresses a hope that, as there is no sign of an English Valuation Bill in the King's Speech, it might appear in the Budget; and he adds&#x2014;
<quote>" But we will wait to see before coming to a conclusion."</quote>
Then he adds&#x2014;
<quote>" An apology is necessary for the moderation of the several suggestions put forward in this article, but by way of excuse we may explain that we have borne in mind that a liberal Government is in power and that Mr. Lloyd-George is Chancellor of the Exchequer."</quote>
And now the final sentence of this Socialist is&#x2014;
<quote>" Our proposals have not gone beyond what we have reason to demand in the coming Budget."</quote>
The "demand," my Lords, is in the Budget of to-day. This pamphlet to which I have referred is published by the Independent Labour Party in Bride Lane, Fleet Street. Its writer is Mr. Philip Snowden, M. P., and on the back of the pamphlet is printed
<col>1318</col>
what professes to be a quotation from a letter or speech of Mr. Lloyd-George of May 25, 1908. I know nothing as to the authenticity of the quotation; but on the I back of the pamphlet Mr. Lloyd-George is stated to have said that&#x2014;
<quote>" Mr. Snowden made many suggestions which will be valuable, no doubt, to future Chancellors of the Exchequer."</quote>
It does not seem to have been necessary to wait for future Chancellors of the Exchequer, for here, line by line and clause by clause, your Lordships will find the Budget of to-day dictated and dominated, not by the Government, but to the Government by Mr. Snowden and the Socialist Party. I hope we shall not hear very much more doubt cast upon the parentage of this Budget. I hope it is clear who the real parents were.<lb/>
We are told now that the Budget is not the real issue upon which the fight is to come. We are told that there is a much graver issue that is to occupy the attention of the country. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, on the first day of the debate, used these words&#x2014;
<quote>" No one will be so simple as to believe that the only question which the country will consider will be the question whether this Bill ought to pass into law. Other and graver questions will be raised. We have been in office four years. In 1906 our whole time in the House of Commons was taken up in passing the Education Bill. It came up to this House and was rejected, and the whole labour of that session was thrown away. The following year was not a year of very great legislative enterprise. In 1908 the whole time of the House of Commons was spent in passing the the Licensing Bill."</quote>
Now again, in 1909, he proceeds to describe the passing of the Budget. Then he goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>" In my opinion it is impossible that any Liberal Goverment can ever again bear the heavy burden of office unless it is secured against a repetition of treatment such as our measures have had to undergo for the lust four years."</quote>
Then he goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>" We were not allowed to pass a Small Holdings Bill for Scotland to prevent my country from being depopulated in the rural districts."</quote>
The noble and learned Lord will not for a moment think that I suggest that he did not wish to convey to your Lordships or to the country the exact state of affairs in these years, but I am bound to say that I do not accept his statement as an accurate statement of what took place. I challenge the noble and learned Lord on his record of every year.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0666"/>
<col>1319</col>
I will ask your Lordships to allow me to pass as shortly as I possibly can through the real story, the complete story of each year. I will call your attention first to the noble and learned Lord's statement that the whole time of the House of Commons was taken up in 1906 by the Education Bill and in 1908 by the Licensing Bill. In 1906 apart from the Education Bill your Lordships passed the Agricultural Holdings Bill, the Trades Disputes Bill, and the Workmen's Compensation Bill; therefore, I challenge, and challenge absolutely, the statement that the whole of the time of the House of Commons was taken up with the Education Bill. My Lords, we are to be condemned for the Bills which we rejected or amended in such a way that the House of Commons could not accept them. The Education Bill is the first; let me sec how far their grievance goes. We amended it so as to save the interests of the teachers whom we thought ought to be allowed to teach the religion in which they believed. We also wished to amend it so that the parent might have some voice in the religious education of his child. On that the Government dropped the Bill. My Lords, what happened next? This was an excellent Bill, a Bill which we are to be condemned for wrecking. What did the Government do? Did they reproduce the Bill? They produced a Bill which was absolutely opposed to that Bill in every principle, and therefore if we had passed the Bill in the first session which His Majesty's Government said then was the right thing to do it would have debarred them from doing that which they said in the next session was the right thing. I do not think the country is going to condemn the House of Lords to any great extent on that ground.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, we go on to the session of 1907. I am sorry the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, is not in his place, for I think he would rather join with me in condemning the statement of the Lord Chancellor. [LORD CARRINGTON, who had been standing near the steps of the Throne, took his seat on the Front Bench.] I am glad to see the noble Earl in his place. I was criticising the statement of the Lord Chancellor as to the extent of the legislation in 1907. The noble and learned Lord said that 1907 was not a year of any great enterprise in legislation. My Lords, that was the year when we passed the Small Holdings and Allotments Bill which I thought was the charter of the British farmer. It is passed aside by the Lord Chancellor as though it did not exist.
<col>1320</col>
I hope the noble Earl at the head of the Agricultural Department will bear the blow as best he can. But in that year, when there was nothing of importance, I find that in addition there was the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Bill. I must leave the noble Earl at the head of the Agricultural Department to settle with the Lord Chancellor whether there was anything of importance done in that year or not. In those years we are challenged because we did not pass in this House the Small Holdings (Scotland) Bill, a Bill which we are told was to prevent the depopulation of the country districts. My Lords, I thought we had thrashed that out in the debate on the Bill. What are the facts? I remember perfectly well the Lord Chancellor describing to us most pitifully and touchingly the over-crowding of the great cities in Scotland. Nothing could be worse. But the remedy was the Small Holdings (Scotland) Bill. What did we find when we came to examine the Bill? Its provisions were limited and its extent was limited by its finance, and when we came to examine the finance of the Bill we found that the amount of finance which you were going to put into the Bill would have provided about one small holding for every county in Scotland. That was the great cure for the overcrowding of the cities and the depopulation of the rural districts! Is the country going to condemn the Second Chamber for that offence?<lb/>
There was another Bill, though I do not think the noble and learned Lord mentioned it, the Land Values (Scotland) Bill. It may have escaped his notice that that Bill was destroyed in the same session. I will take the blame of that on my shoulders. What was the reason of that? It was a Bill to deal with land values eventually after valuation, to help the rates. Do the Government adhere to that policy still? Is not it the fact that now your land valuation scheme is not going to help the rates, but its yield is going to be dragged into the Consolidated Fund? Therefore, with regard to the Bill that we have discarded, we find that the Government themselves have never made up their minds as to what was right and what was wrong.<lb/>
Now I come to the great charge, the serious charge, of our offence against the Licensing Bill. We all know that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack felt very severely the rejection of that Bill, he had it so much at heart. But I venture to think
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0667"/>
<col>1321</col>
that there are very few people who know the feeling of the country who have any doubt that your Lordships in rejecting that Bill did that which the country wished. In our view it was a grave infringement of the rights of licence holders. But I do not want to go too far into that. What I wish to point out is that this is the great fundamental sin upon which the House of Lords is to be condemned. If His Majesty's Government had adhered to their policy with regard to licensed houses, if the Licensing Bill of 1908 had been passed, would your Budget of this year, with its licensing clauses, have been possible? Have you not changed you flank absolutely and entirely? You were going in 1908 to destroy licences without compensation; now you frame your scheme on the taxation of those very houses which you sought to destroy. Before you try to take us to task for interfering with legislation, I think you are bound to show, at least, that in the Bills which you are now attacking us for destroying you yourselves in two sessions ever maintained the same policy on the same line of legislation.<lb/>
In 1908 we were told, again, that the Licensing Bill had taken the whole time of the House of Commons and that your Lordships then threw out that important Bill. What was the work of 1908? Apart from the Licensing Bill your Lordships passed the Coal Mines (Eight Hours) Bill, the Criminal Appeal Bill&#x2014;not an unimportant measure&#x2014;the Port of London Bill, and, last, but not least, the Old Age Pensions Bill. I do claim this, that when an indictment is made against your Lordships' House it ought not to be said that the measures referred to are those which have taken the whole time of the House of Commons. Statements of that kind are bound to mislead the people of the country if no comment is made upon them.<lb/>
Now we come to the session of 1909, and your Lordships will remember we were told in His Majesty's gracious Speech what was going to occupy the greater part of the session. While there has been a great deal of fulmination against your Lordships' House for its evil deeds in the field of legislation it is a little curious to note that, during all the time while these denunciations have been going on through the past weeks, we in this House have been busy trying to pass&#x2014;yes, and to make workable&#x2014;two of the chief Bills of the session, the Housing and I Town Planning Bill and the Irish Land
<col>1322</col>
Bill. I do not mean to say that those Bills are perfect, but I do say that your Lordships have had a great hand in making those Bills far more workable than they would have been, and in making them more just and more fair than they were when they reached your Lordships' House. It is perfectly clear, then, that the attack, unjustified as I think I have shown it is, made upon your Lordships' House for throwing out Bills has failed, because none of those Bills are Bills on which His Majesty's Government had really made up their minds or upon which they were prepared to adhere to their policy with respect to them.<lb/>
The case fails there. But the case began long ago. It has nothing to do with the Budget; this declaration of war started some years back. Your Lordships need not be reminded of the Resolution passed by Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman's Government in 1907. Your Lordships will also remember the methods by which that Resolution was to be carried out. Fortunately it is to be found in the records of Parliament&#x2014;
<quote>" That in order to give effect to the will of the people, as expressed by their elected representatives, it is necessary that the power of the other House to alter or reject Bills passed by this House&#x2014;</quote>
all Bills, remark&#x2014;
<quote>" should be restricted by law, so as to secure that, within the limits of a single Parliament, the decision of the Commons should prevail."</quote>
In the speech which the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, made last night he took my noble friend Lord Milner to task because he had said that under this proposal it would be possible to suspend the Septennial Act. So it would&#x2014;absolutely possible; any Bill might be passed. There would be no appeal, no Second Chamber; it is all done within one Parliament, so that the constituencies can never have their say, and there is no limit to the powers you propose to take. It amounts to a suspension of the Septennial Act and the establishment of the Rump Parliament again. Whether that would be suitable to the circumstances of the present time I will not discuss, but I do not know how you would get rid of it without a revolution. You can get rid of the decision of a Second Chamber by an election, but you cannot get rid of an autocratic all-powerful single Chamber by any means short of a revolution.<lb/>
I could not quite understand what was said by the noble Viscount to the effect that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0668"/>
<col>1323</col>
a Parliament elected in 1906 would come to an end under the Septennial Act in 1912, and by invariable custom in 1911, and therefore to say to the House of Commons, "We do not like your Budget," thus sending back the House of Commons to the country at the end of four years, would be contrary to the Septennial Act. Surely the Septennial Act was not intended to set up a Parliament for seven years, but to protect the country against a Parliament sitting for longer than that. Surely the Septennial Act was not intended to prevent a Parliament coming to an end in a few months, within two years, or five years after election; the Septennial Act was surely intended to protect the people against the maintenance of a Parliament for more than seven years. The noble Viscount explained to your Lordships the strong view he entertained as to the power of a Parliament after election. He argued that a Ministry might be elected on a mandate, but the Parliament, when elected, could not be fettered in any measures it might think fit to take. That, coupled with Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Resolution, shows pretty clearly what is in the mind of the Government. It means that a single Chamber, without check, returned on a distinct mandate, ought to be at liberty, unchecked, to carry out any legislation the majority might support. I do not think that such a proposal will commend itself to a freedom-loving people.<lb/>
In all these matters, these legislative matters, of the last few sessions to which I have referred we have been fighting Bill after Bill practically upon one principle, the principle that we wish to keep separate judicial and administrative functions. We fought this over and over again, not on one, but on half a dozen Bills, notably in the Irish Land Bill and the Housing and Town-Planning Bill, and our efforts have not attained all we wished for. Unless we can get some sort of system on this principle established, what is to happen to the rights of local authorities and individuals? His Majesty's Government seem persistently bent on overriding local authorities and private individuals in regard to the compulsory taking of property, refusing access of the parties to Courts of law, refusing the decision of an impartial tribunal, and insisting upon the dominating will of an absolute bureaucracy. That is the question upon which we have fought. We have endeavoured to check the application of this
<col>1324</col>
policy in these Bills, we have endeavoured to introduce the principle we think essential to the rights of a free people.<lb/>
We are asked, Are we afraid of Socialism under this Bill. My Lords, we are not afraid of Socialism when it is put as a clean issue before the people of this country, but we do distrust the action of a Government who, denying Socialistic principles in words, are putting Socialism into their Budget. We are often told we shall not get a clean issue in the next election. No, my Lords, His Majesty's Government will take good care of that. We may not get a clean issue in this election or the next, but before you carry out your proposed abolition of a Second Chamber we must come to a clean issue, and for that clean issue, my Lords, we are content to wait. I have delayed your Lordships too long. I thank you heartily for your kind indulgence; but before I sit down I wish to ask your Lordships to clearly and boldly face your responsibility, a responsibility not for your own interests, but laid upon you by the Constitution of the country for the protection of the people of this country. I beg you to be true to your duty under this responsibility, and, believing that you will be true, I ask you to pass my noble friend's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03697"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition in moving his Amendment drew attention kindly, but I think with some ironic intent, to the fact that in moving the Second Reading of the Finance. Bill I made no speech. In any other place and at any other time, I might have felt disposed to appeal to precedent in this matter. Noble Lords will find that for many years past it has not been usual for the Minister who introduces the finance measure of the year to make anything in the nature of a financial statement, but merely as a rule to reply upon the debate. But I feel that while we are considering this Amendment&#x2014;which is the absolute negation of precedent and which flouts all usage&#x2014;it seems almost indelicate towards noble Lords opposite to appeal to what has been done in the past. I will, therefore, simply observe that it seemed to me to be more for the general convenience, as I did not desire to inflict two speeches upon your Lordships, that I should say what I had to say at the close of the debate rather than at the beginning.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0669"/>
<col>1325</col>
My Lords, there is at least one point in connection with this Budget on which I think we are all agreed&#x2014;that it is necessary for the service of the year to raise by extra taxation a sum of, at any rate, some thirteen millions of money. I say we are all agreed because both Parties accept the principles upon which this large extra sum has to be raised. The first of those principles is that it is now necessary to devote a larger sum than in rectnt years to the defences of the country. I am sorry that both the noble Lords. Lord Curzon and the noble Earl who has just sat down, thought it necessary to express in very plain terms their doubts as to whether His Majesty's present advisers are in favour of maintaining the defences of the country at their proper strength. I do not know what we have done to deserve that taunt. I think that the public records of both my right hon. friends who preside over the two great Departments concerned, and also the fact that we called together a Colonial Conference from all parts of the Empire to consider the question of defence, are sufficient answer to the noble Lords. But we shall be prepared when the proper occasion arises to take up the challenge of noble Lords opposite and to defend our defence policy.<lb/>
Then as regards old age pensions&#x2014;the other subject for which this large sum of money is required&#x2014;your Lordships have accepted, grudgingly I am afraid, but still you have accepted the principle of old age pensions. I might just point out that, even if you say you would have preferred a contributory scheme to the form of old age pensions which we embodied in our measure, unless you were prepared to postpone the benefit of pensions for some forty or fifty years, you must at any rate raise in the present year a sum not much less than that we are now asking the country to provide. The sum total of this long debate is that you consider that our methods of raising this sum of money are revolutionary, and you consider that that fact justifies a revolution on your part, and in order to meet that revolution you are forming yourselves, not into a Committee of Supply, but into a Committee of Public Safety to refuse supplies.<lb/>
What are the main objections&#x2014;I will deal with them first&#x2014;which are taken to the substance of this Finance Bill? So far as I am able to gather from the various
<col>1326</col>
speeches that have been made, you object to it, first, because it imposes taxes upon capital. You object to it, next, because it imposes taxes upon land in a manner which you consider leads up to land nationalisation, and, thirdly, you object to the increase of the Licence Duties. Now, my Lords, when noble Lords say that they object to taxes on capital, I should like to feel sure what they mean. Taxes on capital in contradistinction to what? Do you mean that you object to taxes on capital in contradistinction to taxes on income, or do you object to taxes on capital in contradistinction to taxes upon earnings? Because those are two very different things. In the first case it is rather a question of machinery. You propose to raise the money from the same persons, but instead of raising it in a large sum as by Death Duties, at a fixed or uncertain period, you propose to raise it annually, say, in the form of a graduated Super Tax. My Lords, that is a perfectly arguable proposition, and it is open to anybody to take the view that the one form of raising the money is better than the other. But if your objection to the taxation of capital is that it is not the taxation of earnings, then do not go about the country saying that you are of opinion that the rich ought to be taxed and that the poor ought not to be taxed more than they are. I know the argument. You broaden the basis of taxation, and you raise more money from the less well-to-do and from the poor than we propose to raise, but it is all for their good in the long run. You are going to take more of their money in the form of taxation but you are going to benefit them in the form of employment. Well, My Lords, that may be. I will not argue that point at this moment. But do not say that you are not proposing by any alternative you may have to this Budget to tax the poor more and the rich less, because that cannot be the case.<lb/>
Is your real objection to this form of taxation an objection to graduation? Graduation is a very old story. I believe there was a graduated Income Tax in the fifteenth century. To come to much more recent time, everybody knows that in Mr. Pitt's great Budget of 1799 the system of abatement, and consequently of graduation, was instituted very much on the lines on which Income Tax is graduated now. But the charge which has been brought against us with an ability which I admire
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0670"/>
<col>1327</col>
and with a force which to some extent I am willing to admit, is that there has been a serious fall in securities and that capital is leaving the country. That was enforced in a speech by Lord Revelstoke, which has received many compliments but not more compliments than it deserved, and it was also enforced by other speakers well qualified to give an opinion on the subject.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I make two admissions. I admit that capital is a very timid thing. Its mobility is denied, but if it is not as agile as an antelope it is, I am willing to admit, almost as timid. That is one admission. The other admission I am prepared to make is this, though I am afraid it also involves something in the nature of a charge, that it may be the case that some people have been, by what they have heard, induced to sell British securities and invest in foreign securities. But if that be so, that is because noble Lords and other people of equal authority have frightened this timid creature capital and have, without of course in the faintest degree meaning to do it, helped to bring about the result which they themselves deplore.<lb/>
The figures of foreign investments are almost astronomical in their magnitude. I see it is said that during the seven years from 1884&#x2013;1890 we invested the sum of &#x00A3;400,000,000 abroad. From 1890 to 1904, not particularly prosperous years, we only invested &#x00A3;100,000,000 abroad. From 1905 to the present date, 1909, we have invested some &#x00A3;400,000,000 abroad, and I supose that if matters proceed as they are doing it is not unlikely that in the seven years we shall have invested some &#x00A3;700,000,000. Nobody admitted in general terms more frankly than Lord Rothschild, who spoke yesterday, that foreign investments of this kind are of immense advantage to this country. It is evident, of course, that it must be so. Not only do people get good interest for their money, but a great deal of the money is actually laid out in this country in suppyling material for railways and kindred objects. That is a ground of common agreement. But is it the fact that in consequence of these gigantic investments abroad capital cannot be found at home for sound commercial and industrial objects? That is a point on which it seems to me the experience of any one man, no matter how distinguished a financier, cannot be sufficient to give an answer. A very large
<col>1328</col>
amount of <i>data</i> must surely be collected and carefully revised before anybody could presume to say that this either is or is not the case, and I do not know that such <i>data</i> are forthcoming.<lb/>
But at any rate there are some <i>data</i> which tend to show that although there has been a depreciation in securities, yet in the case of a large number of the most important industrial concerns in this country they have no difficulty in securing or in getting the money which they require for their enterprise. I have here a list of the debenture issues of twelve of the most important industrial concerns in this country. I will not trouble you with their names, but I imagine that their total united capital must be much more than &#x00A3;50,000,000. There is nothing whatever in the figures of those debentures during the last two or three years to support the allegation that the general policy of His Majesty's Government has been such as to cause a fall. Some have fallen slightly, others have risen slightly, but the general position remains much the same, and when we come to consider what has happened between the middle of April, when the Budget was introduced, and the middle of November we find that the debentures of these great industrial concerns have on the whole slightly risen, and their shares have risen very perceptibly indeed&#x2014;all this in spite of the fact that when the Budget was introduced the Bank rate was two and a-half, whereas to-day it is five. That certainly does not seem as though the Budget has had the effect with which it is charged.<lb/>
I should like to offer one or two general observations on this subject. I think it is evident that the whole trend of investment must as time goes on tend rather in the direction of the choice of foreign securities so long as the facts remain as they are&#x2014;namely, that in every class of security, whether it be Government securities or railway debentures, or any other class, the rate of interest in this country for each is somewhat lower than can be obtained in other parts of the world. My Lords, investment has grown up from the day when people hid their savings in an old stocking. It passes then to the stage in which a man puts his money in a few houses which he can see before him. Perhaps then, getting a little bolder and a little more educated, he will put stock in a railway which runs through the county in which he lives. At last he finds, as his
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0671"/>
<col>1329</col>
experience grows wider, that money can be invested safely abroad, and what to begin with was put in an old stocking ends perhaps in British Columbia or in Buenos Ayres. As the general scale of living in every class tends to become higher, and, if you like the word, more luxurious, the rate of interest which a man gets becomes more and more important, and as quite good security with higher rates of interest can obtained abroad, there is naturally a temptation to the investor to place his money there.<lb/>
I pass for a moment to the land proposals of His Majesty's Government on which so many strictures have been made. I do not propose to trouble the House by going through the different duties suggested and defending them in detail, but this I will confidently say, that I believe the general sense of fairness of the community will support the proposition that the special kind of land which in this Finance Bill we propose to tax is a reasonable subject of taxation, and that our proposals to tax it are moderate in themselves. I have never been able to understand why, if it is a reasonable thing to tax undeveloped land for local purposes, it is a monstrous and Socialistic thing to tax it for State or Imperial purposes. I can understand the arguments that maybe used as to the destination of the money, that it is fair that a large portion of it should go locally, but when it comes to the question of Social-ism or no Socialism, I do not see that it matters to a man who lives in the West-end of London and is thus taxed whether his tax goes to the five or six million people in London or the forty millions in the British Isles.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, in his speech put to me a question with regard to the nationalisation of land, and the request that I should express an opinion on that subject was further made by Lord Denbigh this evening. I perhaps am less alarmed than some of your Lordships on the subject, I do not say of the nationalisation of the land, but the national ownership of land, because in a part of the world for whose affairs at this moment I am responsible that system exists in absolute perfection. There is no part of the Empire about which higher hopes may properly be entertained than the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria. Northern Nigeria possesses a very ancient Mahommedan civilisation. It is so civilised that one of the features of its taxation from
<col>1330</col>
immemorial times. Las been a graduated land tax, and another has been a Death Duty. In Northern Nigeria there is no private ownership of land, and I sincerely hope there never will be. I trust that whoever presides over the Colonial Office will not be captivated by the idea that any country where the land is the property of the nation and where its complete ownership is not admitted but only its use, must necessarily be a backward or unhappy country.<lb/>
I should like to ask the noble Marquess and the noble Lord who have both with such distinction filled the office of Viceroy of India whether the various systems of Indian land settlement, apart, of course, from permanent settlement, do not represent a sort of half-way house between national ownership of the land and private ownership, as we understand it in this country. But your Lordships will say, "After all, these are remote and we want to know about England. What is the view of His Majesty's Government with regard to the nationalisation of the land?" I have to assert again that the subject is one that has never been discussed by His Majesty's Government. I have no reason to suppose that if His Majesty's Government had been permitted to last through the usual course of office it would have ever been discussed by them. The noble Marquess whose questions I am always delighted to answer, asked for my personal opinion, and I will tell him this. In my view the idea of the nationalisation of all the land in this country is as remote and as fantastic as anything which can be found in the novels of Mr. Wells When I say this I am far indeed from saying that there may not, and ought not to be, if you like, a large extension both of national and municipal ownership of land; but I do say this, that the interests connected with the holding of land are far too solid and far too numerous and the transactions in which land has been treated, I will not say identically, but similarly to other forms of property, go so far back and are so countless that, I will not say the probability, but the possibility of anything like a general national ownership of the whole of the land of the country seems to me to be nothing but a dream.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, something was said about the injustice of the taxation of mining royalties. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, was not, I think, accurate when he said that this Budget for the first time taxes capital. As
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0672"/>
<col>1331</col>
a matter of fact, capital-was first taxed in a direct form by the imposition of the Death Duties in 1894. But I may remind the noble Lord that the so-called Income Tax on mining royalties which has existed in various forms ever since there has been an income tax, is not a tax on income but is, and always has been, a tax on capital. As regards mining royalties. I would only say that anybody who takes the trouble to study the existence of the mineral rights of landowners in other countries in Europe, such countries as Germany and Austria-Hungary, not specially democratic in their form of Government, and who compares the conditions which obtain there with the conditions as to the ownership of minerals which obtain in England, will agree that the owner of mineral rights in this country is a very fortunate person; and I do not think-that the extra taxation that is imposed on this particular form of wealth can be considered as unduly onerous.<lb/>
I pass next to the objections in substance which noble Lords have taken. The charge of "tacking" has been brought against us with reference to this Finance Bill. I have wondered as I have heard this charge repeated in speech after speech whether noble Lords have attempted to realise what "tacking" really means. I will not repeat the well-known Resolution read out at the Table by the most rev. Prelate the Archbishop of York. That resolution tells you what "tacking" is, and it is also important to realise what "tacking" is not. The noble Earl who has just sat down, with great elaboration, charged us with having introduced into this Budget subjects to be dealt with by way of a tax which we had formerly tried to deal with by way of Bills. That may or may not be a right thing to do, but it has nothing whatever to do at any rate with "tacking."<lb/>
The noble Lord in developing another argument pointed out that whereas we tried to deal with licensing by Bill last year we are now dealing with it by a tax in the Finance Bill, and he pointed out, for the sake of the particular argument he was using, how different the two proceedings were. They are different. The noble Earl asked my opinion, I liked last year's attempt better than I like this, and I liked the Licensing Bill of last year better than I like the system of high licences. To say that because you have in one session attempted to legislate in a particular way you are debarred for the
<col>1332</col>
rest of the Parliament from touching that subject in any way is surely a prevention which has never been advanced before. Again, our moral position may be extremely bad, but that has nothing whatever to do with tacking. We are told that we are dealing with these subjects in a spirit of vindictive-ness. Kindlier critics have said that our zeal for temperance has led us to place too heavy a burden on those who deal in alcoholic liquors. But even if our minds are churning with the most hideous sentiments towards all respectable persons&#x2014;such as millionaires, brewers, and others&#x2014;that has nothing whatever to do with "tacking."<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, objected to our liquor proposals on other grounds. He objected to them because we had said that we hoped the Budget would have a good effect in bringing about a certain reduction in the number of public houses, and he told the House that such a hope was altogether foreign to a Finance Bill, which ought to be concerned with revenue only. I quote no less an authority to the contrary than Mr Pitt. When Mr. Pitt introduced his Budget in 1796 in another place&#x2014;and he introduced it on December 7, I observe, so that the plight of Parliament that year was even worse than it is now&#x2014;he said, in imposing a further duty upon spirits&#x2014;
<quote>" So long as the consumption continues to a considerable extent an addition to the duty must be considered highly eligible in every view of policy and morals."</quote>
Policy and morals&#x2014;those are the two things to which the noble Viscount opposite objects. Precisely the same argument would be used if you were introducing some high duty in a tariff reform measure, which would have the additional advantage, as contended by noble Lords opposite, of giving employment. If it gave employment, it must diminish revenue.<lb/>
The noble Marquess who leads the Opposition said he was certain we should ask him what his alternative proposals were. I should never have thought of asking the noble Marquess what his alternative proposals were, because I really did not know whether he had made up his mind as to any. There is no member of the Party opposite, I think, who during the six years since Tariff Reform has been before us, has given so little indication as the noble Marquess has done of the precise nature of the taxation which he desires to introduce under the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0673"/>
<col>1333</col>
name of Tariff Reform. But, of course, we have other authorities. There is the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, who is prepared to get it all out of the foreigner. He is like C&#x00E6;sar Augustus; he is prepared to issue a decree that all the world should be taxed. We know that Lord Midleton's view is an entirely different one. He wants to reimpose the taxes on sugar and tea, and the export duty on coal. That is in addition to the new food taxes. In this, I think, the noble Viscount has all the materials for a popular Budget&#x0021;<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, takes an entirely different view; he desires to tax the luxuries of the rich, but he did not explain how it is to be done. However you are going to tax the luxuries of the rich, you cannot do it by any variety of what is known as Tariff Reform, if Tariff Reform means import duties. The luxuries of the rich, with very few exceptions&#x2014;champagne might be mentioned, but it takes a great deal of champagne to float a Dreadnought&#x2014;are products made in this country. I will explain what I mean. What are the special luxuries of the rich? Racehorses, hunters, yachts, the taking of expensive shootings, motor-cars&#x2014;very largely now, I am glad to think, made in this country&#x2014;the taking of deer forests, and the renting of expensive houses generally. What system of sumptuary laws the noble Marquess may have in his mind in order to tax these luxuries I do not know, and I shall await with interest his reply.<lb/>
I pass away from the subject matter of the Finance Bill to the more important, the graver question involved&#x2014;the relations which now arise between the two Houses. My Lords, earlier in the Session we had an interesting debate on the subject of colour-blindness. It was pointed out to us how disastrous it would be at sea if a man were not able to distinguish between the red lights and the green lights on ships. What are we to say of that kind of colour-blindness, constitutional in every sense of the word, which cannot, discern the difference between these red benches in your Lordships' House and the green benches in that House at the end of the Lobby yonder. It is that form of colour-blindness which I very much fear is steering your ship straight into a collision with another ship which you will find heavier and stronger than your own.<lb/>
My Lords, much has been said of the
<col>1334</col>
right of this House to throw out a Finance Bill. I confess I prefer to speak of power, because the rights of an Assembly such as this are its powers, and its powers are its rights. I prefer to use the word "power," because the word "right" seems to connote some idea of a moral sanction, which is just the question which we are disputing. Nobody disputes the power of your Lordships' House to reject this Bill or any other Money Bill. The opinions of my two distinguished predecessors, Lord Ripon and Lord Spencer, have been quoted. It was, of course, of the power of your Lordships' House that they were speaking, and, if I remember aright, Lord Spencer expressly guarded himself in that respect. Your Lord ships have the power to do a great many other things. The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, expressed his regret that it was not possible to put this Bill in Committee, when he would thoroughly enjoy its dissection. I have no doubt the noble Earl would. But so far as power goes, there is nothing whatever that I know of to prevent your Lordships not merely considering this Bill in Committee, but in sending it to a Select Committee with the noble Earl as Chairman.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03698"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03699"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: So long as I am not called upon to sit on that Committee I have very little objection. But it hardly is a question of the power of this House. Let me quote to your Lordships words I should like to adopt that were used by one who was certainly not an indifferent member of this House, who was in it all his life, and who certainly was not unmindful of its privileges&#x2014;the late Duke of Argyll. On the occasion when the Paper Duty Repeal came up a second time as a clause in the Budget of 1861, the Duke of Argyll said this&#x2014;
<quote>" Many Bills of Supply have been rejected by the House of Lords, but the course pursued by the noble Earl [Lord Derby, the grandfather of the noble Lord opposite] is not so much a technical violation of the privileges of the House of Commons as a substantial violation of the established usages between the two Houses of Parliament."</quote>
The point could not have been better put then, and it could not be better put now. As the most rev. Prelate reminded us this afternoon, that was a single Bill, not a Bill dealing with the Supply of the year, sent up in 1860 by a majority of only nine,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0674"/>
<col>1335</col>
and sent up in the second year as a clause in the Customs and Revenue Bill by a majority of only fifteen&#x2014;not, therefore coming with anything approaching the sanction of this great measure now before your Lordships' House. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, used the argument that, after all, the rejection of this Bill was only parallel to the rejection of the Paper Duty Repeal Bill, because at that time Bills were sent up separately and now they are sent up together. Surely that is not so. A parallel to the rejection of the present Bill would be the rejection at that time of every Bill which dealt with the Supplies of the year or with the incidence of taxation. I cannot help referring once more to that debate, in the course of which Lord Derby alluded in dignified tones to the privileges of the House of Commons, of which he had been, perhaps, the most brilliant ornament. There are many noble Lords sitting opposite who have been in their time, although, perhaps, not quite so brilliant as the fourteenth Lord Derby, still most distinguished figures in the other House. Yet only one of those noble Lords in the whole course of this long debate has allowed it to be supposed that he recognises or values in the slightest degree the privileges of that House. That noble Lord is Lord Ashbourne. Only one noble Lord, and he is an Irishman.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Morley dealt fully and, I venture to think, conclusively with the plea that you put forward that in the action which you are taking you are making a democratic appeal. I do not propose to labour that point, but I desire to say one word on the state of things which may exist in the future if your Lordships are right in your claim to reject a Finance Bill, which you say is of so important a character that it must be submitted to the country. I do not want to overstate the case, and I do not suppose for a moment that your Lordships will proceed immediately to reject every Liberal Budget that comes up in future years. That would be a possible course on the part of this House, just as is now the rejection of every measure that comes up from another place when a Liberal Government is in power. It is possible in theory; I quite admit it has not been the practice; but it would be possible to reject the Budget every year, and therefore to force a Dissolution. I do not say that that would happen. What I do say would happen is this, that after a Liberal Government had been in power for say two years,
<col>1336</col>
I in framing its financial proposals it would have to consider whether they would receive the concurrence of your Lordships' House. That is an entirely novel claim, and I say that if it is admitted, it involves something like a burlesque of representative government.<lb/>
The theory of government which some I noble Lords seem to favour is that a Government, on coming into power, is to be haunted by fears that some of those who have voted for it at a General Election may have changed their minds, and it is to be so paralysed by fear as to be scarcely able to bring in any legislation whatever. That theory has not been maintained in the past by noble Lords opposite when they have been in office. The Government of noble Lords opposite which flickered out to its inglorious extinction in December, 1905, was troubled by no such fear. It completely altered the basis of our licensing system, it reversed the policy of previous Governments and, so far as is known, of the country in respect of elementary education, and we never had any inkling that it was haunted by the fears which noble Lords desire us to feel. My Lords, I should respect this theory of yours of an appeal to the people much more than I am afraid I do now if I believed that it was really advanced in order to vindicate what you believe to be an ancient right instead of being advanced, as I cannot help thinking it is, to promote a new-fangled policy.<lb/>
I desire to ask one question which may not have occurred to your Lordships. What do you think your fellow-subjects in His Majesty's Dominions all over the Empire will think of what you are doing to-night? I venture to say that the action your Lordships' House is taking will be absolutely unintelligible to men of all parties in the self-governing Dominions of the Crown. It is so alien to the spirit of their Constitutions, so foreign to their universal practice that they will be altogether unable to understand it. A Canadian, perhaps, will ask himself how the financial conditions of the Dominion would fare if it was to the descendants of the ancient French seigneurs that they were entrusted. The Australian will wonder what would happen if the finances of the Commonwealth were handed over to the heirs of the squatters in the older States. Citizens of the new South African Union may, and I dare say will, ask themselves what would
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0675"/>
<col>1337</col>
happen if the finances of the Union are to be committed to the care of, say, the Dutch settlers in some of the more remote districts of the different Colonies, whose outlook upon life is not altogether dissimilar from that of some of your Lordships who have come here to vote to-night. All I can say is this, that if you are right, and if the country condones and approves what you are doing to-night, our fellow-subjects abroad will not look to the mother of Parliaments, but they will ask if the citizens of the old country are altogether fitted to exercise responsible Government.<lb/>
My Lords, we are now going to vote. In 1860 when the Paper Duty Bill was before this House Mr. Bright said, speaking of the then action of your Lordships' House&#x2014;
<quote>" They voted out this Bill by a large majority with a chuckle, thinking that by doing so they were making a violent attack on the Ministry, and particularly upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer."</quote>
My Lords, that is what you are going to do. Who are going to vote? The noble Lords who are here. Who are not going to vote? I cannot help alluding, although it has been mentioned before, to the absence from the noble Marquess's battalions of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn&#x2014;one of the most experienced authorities on political finance in the country, and a Conservative of Conservatives. He is not here. But when the Division list is scanned to-morrow, as scanned it will be, by those who desire to weigh as well as to count, many names will be missed from it. There will be the names of many of those who have grown old in the service of the State at home and abroad, particularly of those who have served in distant parts of the Empire; the names of many of those who do the greater part of the real work of this House&#x2014;thankless work, and not, I think, often sufficiently rewarded by public appreciation&#x2014;in the committee rooms upstairs; there will be many names of those who possess, if I may venture to say so, the coolest heads and the most amply furnished minds in the House; many of those who, when it is a question of deciding the merits of some great dispute between capital and labour, are called upon to arbitrate in such cases by the common consent of all classes of our fellow-countrymen. My Lords, many of those will not be here. Like the images of the Roman patriots at another kind of funeral some 2,000 years ago, when the historian said&#x2014;<i>Effulgebant eo ipso quod</i>
<col>1338</col>
<i>effigies corum non videbantur</i>&#x2014;they are even more conspicuous by their absence than they would be if they recorded their vote. I know you will not agree with me, but I do say that in tearing up the ancient charters, in removing the venerable landmarks, you are making a most tragic blunder. You are not afraid of the consequences; no one could suppose you would be afraid; if you are afraid of anything in this matter you are possibly just the least bit afraid of being thought afraid. That is the only scintilla of fear which I think could be recognised on the Benches opposite.<lb/>
It has been said in debate that there has been a sinister kind of conspiracy, a plot, to lure your Lordships into an impossible position. Perhaps I may be permitted to say that I am in as good a position as anybody to judge whether that is so, and I think I can show you it is not so. I do not think I am breaking any Cabinet confidence when I say that the great majority of my colleagues including&#x2014;unless I am mistaken&#x2014;the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself, have been infinitely more sanguine than I have been all through that your Lordships would pass the Finance Bill, and it was only at a very recent date that they recognised the probability of the action your Lord-ships are taking. That I think is conclusive proof that there has been no conspiracy to put your Lordships into a position when you could not pass it.<lb/>
Much has been said of the privileges of this House; the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, a few days ago lectured me&#x2014;if he will forgive me for saying so&#x2014;somewhat professorially with regard to the privileges of the House and my duty in supporting them. I can only say that my personal debt to the House, particularly in the last few years, is far too deep to allow me to speak of any action the House may take with a tinge of rancour. But all the individual kindness and consideration that I myself and my friends behind me have received from noble Lords opposite cannot blind me to the fact that the position of Liberal Ministers in this House has become an almost impossible one.<lb/>
I am not fond of autobiography. I agree with my noble friend Lord Rosebery that it is not as a rule an ornament of debate, but speaking upon the question of privilege, I may detain your Lordships for a moment
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0676"/>
<col>1339</col>
with my own experience. I came here for the first time in the short Government of 1886 when I was a member of Her late Majesty's Household and had charge of a Department. After that we retired into exile for several years; and in fifteen years of Opposition I can say with all honesty that I cannot recall a single case when I or my noble friends&#x2014;infinitely more competent and distinguished&#x2014;and I may mention Lord Rosebery, Lord Kimberley, and Lord Ripon, did the slightest good to himself or any human being by his attendance in the House. I cannot recall a case when anything we said here had the slightest effect. I cannot recall a case when any Amendment of substance to any of the Bills of the then Governments were modified at our instance. The noble Marquess therefore, will not be surprised when I say, although I hope I do not underrate the value of the privileges of this House, that I cannot look upon them with exactly the same eyes as he does.<lb/>
There is a further point. During those years, and I should like to appeal to the recollection of those of my noble friends who have been in the House as long as I have, there has been a great deal of very real encroachment by those who are now in Opposition, in the attitude they have taken up as to the powers of this House. I remember the late Lord Salisbury once uttering one of those truisms, which are sometimes the most valuable contribution which any one can make to a debate, when he pointed out that the political power as between the two Houses of Parliament was a constant quantity, and that, for instance, supposing the House of Commons possessed the fraction of four-fifths and your Lordships' House the remaining one-fifth, or any other respective fractions you choose, it was impossible to add anything to the one without taking away from the other. There has been, I think, a distinct encroachment on the part of noble Lords opposite, in particular with regard to the way they now treat Government Bills.<lb/>
We all regarded the late Lord Salisbury with unstinted admiration. He was a man, as it seemed to us, who shared the view of the philosopher that people were "mostly fools," and he certainly never gave his political opponents any reason to remain under the illusion that he counted
<col>1340</col>
them as belonging to the wiser minority. But I think he also held the view that men must find out the consequences of their own mistakes, and, if the people of this country chose to send certain representatives to Parliament of whose views he disapproved, that in the main the operations of such a House of Commons ought to be respected; although, of course, as we know there were cases when he was the first to propose the rejection of particular measures. But he did not do what noble Lords do now, which is to take complete charge of the Government measures sent up to this House. Nothing could be more agreeably done than the way in which noble Lords do it. They take our Bills, and then the first thing they speak of is the "concessions" they are so kind as to make. The way that has been done has in my judgment constituted a most serious encroachment, although it would take a long time to describe by instances what I mean, and I should have to occupy an even longer period than Lord Cawdor did when he was narrating, from his own point of view, the history of the Bills in the present Parliament. The fact remains that in my view, and I think in the view of those who sit on this side of the House, this encroachment has actually taken place. I think that the action which is being recommended by the noble Marquess to-night has been defended on much bolder grounds of independence than I have ever heard advanced in this House before. For instance, I never heard before the plain statement made by Lord Curzon that it was a reasonable thing for this House to have the power of dissolving Parliament.<lb/>
All these things have brought us to the position in which we now stand. My Lords, what is that position? For many years past the two Houses of Parliament have jogged along together as acquaintances jog along who are not, perhaps, consumed by a burning affection for each other, but at the same time are prepared to do business together. There have been losses of temper from time to time on both sides, and there have been other times when allowances have been made. But, my Lords, after to-night the two Houses, regarding them still as people, will barely be on speaking terms. In a very significant passage at the end of his speech Lord Curzon alluded to possible reforms of this House. It is a somewhat singular comment, I think, upon this question of reform that the
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0677"/>
<col>1341</col>
Report of the Committee which sat for many days and which contained a large majority of the most distinguished members of your Lordships' House has been allowed to lie on the Table absolutely unnoticed from that day to this. It may or may not be&#x2014;I express no opinion of the outcome of the future&#x2014;that important changes may take place in the constitution of your Lordships' House. I do not presume to prophesy as to that. But it is late&#x2014;late in one sense although in another it is early&#x2014;to speak of that matter with regard to this particular Division to-night. My Lords, it is an unreformed House of Lords which is throwing out this Budget, and the mere fact that the noble Lord and some others favour some change in the composition of this House cannot be taken as in any way altering that fact.<lb/>
If you think that any of us on this side of the House welcome this crisis you are entirely mistaken. But we are compelled to face it, not only because our political existence as a Party is involved, but because in our view the interests of the country and of the Empire depend upon the maintenance of a reasonable constitutional balance between the governing powers of the State. It may be, may Lords, that when the new Parliament meets we shall be sitting where you sit now. It may be that we shall still be seated</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03711"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the absence of my noble friend Earl Carrington, who is, I am sorry to say, unwell, I beg leave to move that the Commons Amendments to the Lords Amendments to this Bill be considered.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03713"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we proceed to deal <i>seriatim</i> with the Amendments, I should like to offer one or two observations upon the situation with which your Lordships' House finds itself confronted at this moment. Not many hours ago&#x2014;to be precise, at about half past eleven o'clock last night&#x2014;the noble Earl who leads the House was deploring in grave words what he described as the indiscriminate hostility of your Lordships to measures put forward by His Majesty's Government, and he dwelt particularly upon what he termed the increasing encroachment of Conservative Peers in their attitude towards Bills presented to the House by Liberal Administrations. There is, I venture to think, another side to the picture, and that other side is presented to us in a somewhat striking fashion by the Motion which will shortly be made by the noble Earl.<lb/>
My Lords, in the case of this Bill no one can say that there was any approach to indiscriminate hostility on the part of this House. We approached it, endeavouring to exercise our proper functions as a Chamber of revision, in no spirit of hostility, but with a genuine desire to make it a better
<col>1348</col>
and more efficient measure. The noble Earl referred last night to my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn, and spoke of his high position as a Parliamentarian. The noble Earl will recollect that no member of your Lordships' House took a more conspicuous part in the discussion of this Bill than Lord St. Aldwyn. It is, I think, rather fortunate that your Lordships' House did revise the Bill, for it came up to this House in a state which showed that it required a great deal of revision. When the Bill came to us it contained no provisions for public notices or for the issue of advertisement in the locality. It contained no provision for enabling notices to be served upon owners or occupiers, or public bodies; so that it really came to this, that when the Bill was laid on the Table, it would have been perfectly open for any persons or for any body to whom an advance had been made to make an application by word of mouth to the Development Commissioners <i>in camera</i>, and then and there to obtain from them an order for the compulsory acquisition of any property which might be desired without the owners of that property or the persons interested in it being supplied with any kind of notice or warning.<lb/>
There was another blot in the Bill which we were able to cure. In the case of Scotland, the treatment was entirely different&#x2014;unintentionally, no doubt&#x2014;from the treatment in the case of England. Your Lordships' House corrected these mistakes and corrected other imperfections in the Bill and we also introduced a certain number of Amendments, perfectly legitimate Amendments, which we defended in debate and which were not very seriously taken exception to. Now, my Lords, what is it that we find? We find virtually the whole of these Amendments disagreed with by the House of Commons, and disagreed with, with one or two exceptions, upon the ground that they are contrary to the privilege of the House of Commons. That really discloses a very serious state of things. I notice that in the printed Reasons for disagreeing which have been circulated three different formulas are used. The Amendments are objected to either because they involve an alteration of the persons to whom the advance is made, or because they involve an alteration of the purposes for which the advance is made, or because they involve an alteration of the conditions upon which the advance is made. Of course, the whole object of this Bill is to enable advances
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0681"/>
<col>1349</col>
to be made for certain purposes of economic development and for making roads, so that your Lordships will see that if we are not allowed to touch either the person to whom the advance is made, or the purpose for which the advance can be made, or the conditions under which the advance is made, we are virtually told that we must not touch a line of this Bill. It is a plain intimation to us to keep our "Hands off this Bill," and that, my Lords, I venture to characterise as an extreme and unwarrantable exercise of the House of Commons privilege.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not think that any one will get up in this House and suggest that this is a Money Bill. There never was a Bill that could less properly be so described. I have more than once ventured to address this House on the question of privilege. We have to remember that there are two points: first, whether an Amendment made by us touches the House of Commons privilege at all&#x2014;that is a question for the officers of the House of Commons to decide in the first instance&#x2014;and the other question is, assuming that there has been an encroachment upon the privilege of the House of Commons, whether that House should insist upon its privilege. And when I say whether that House should insist on its privilege, of course what that comes to is whether the Government of the day which has a large majority behind it should advise the House to insist upon its privilege or not. It would be of course, most improper for me to say anything with regard to the manner in which the high officers of the House of Commons think proper to deal with matters of privilege. I may, however, be allowed to say that so far as I am able to judge from the precedents which are familiar to us, the tendency is to insist more strictly than of old upon the extreme right of the House of Commons. But what I do want to call attention to is the manner in which in these days the Government jumps at every hint from the Speaker that the question of privilege is involved.<lb/>
May I call your Lordships' attention to what seems to me to be a very striking illustration of what I am saying. Here is the report of the Speaker's observations upon an Amendment made by your Lordships' House to Clause 8. Your Lordships added words enabling the Road Board to make advances to county councils <i>inter alia</i> towards meeting the extraordinary
<col>1350</col>
expenditure incurred by highway authorities on the maintenance of roads in consequence of motor traffic. Mr. Speaker observed, on this question of privilege&#x2014;
<quote>"I have had some doubts with regard to this particular Amendment. I agree with the noble Lord&#x2014;Lord Robert Cecil&#x2014;that it is undesirable to press a question of privilege too far. It is possible that in a case of this sort the proper maintenance of the road is to keep it in a proper state of repair. I can understand that the best way to improve the road is to fill up the holes that are to be found in it, though that may technically not be a general act of improvement. I did not wish to smell out, so to speak, these breaches of privilege in order to raise meticulous objections to Amendments."</quote>
These are pretty strong words from the Speaker. My Lords, in spite of that pretty broad hint from the Chair, the Amendment was disagreed with, and it is disagreed with, as stated in the Paper now in your Lordships' hands, upon the ground that it is an encroachment upon the privilege of the House of Commons. Could your Lordships have any stronger example than that?<lb/>
I should like very much, if your Lordships will bear with me for a moment, to contrast the action of His Majesty's Government in dealing with this important question with the action of other Liberal Statesmen in the House of Commons. The question of privilege was raised at the time when Mr. Abercromby, afterwards Lord Dunfermline, was Speaker of the House of Commons on the question of the Irish Poor Relief Bill in the year 1838. The Speaker then began by saying that he considered the Amendments to be an infringement of the privileges of the House of Commons; but he went on&#x2014;
<quote>"As the Bill was one of a very peculiar character affecting not only the proprietors of land but the great mass of the people of Ireland, and as the principle of rating was necessarily incidental to such a measure, he considered that if the privileges of this House were strictly pressed in such a case, they would almost tend to prevent the House of Peers from taking such a measure into its consideration in a way that might be on all grounds advisable."</quote>
If you attempt to deal with the question of privilege in this way that is what will happen; it will altogether prevent the Peers from taking measures into their consideration. Upon that, Lord John Russell, expressing agreement with the Speaker, used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"In cases of Bills of this description, in which taxation was not the sole but rather an incidental object, any latitude consistent with the due
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0682"/>
<col>1351</col>
observance of the privileges of this House should be allowed to the House of Lords in their legislative functions. He hoped, therefore, that the House would enter upon the consideration of these Amendments, which were, doubtless, framed with the view rather of forwarding the objects of the Bill than otherwise,"</quote>
a description which fairly applies to our Amendments on this Bill. Then later on, in the case of another Irish Bill, Lord John Russell used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"I should be disposed to inquire, in the first place, whether they do not come within the general principle of those cases in which the House has consented to waive its privileges; and, secondly, whether it is expedient upon the whole that we should waive our privileges in the present instance,"</quote>
and he added&#x2014;
<quote>"It is a case in which, to use an expression of Lord Dunfermline, we might, by pressing our privileges, rather weaken than strengthen them."</quote>
My Lords, the only other quotation with which I will trouble you is again from a speech made by Lord John Russell in 1849, in which he spoke as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"With regard to legislation in reference to the condition of the poor, it must be acknowledged by all to be a subject of very great importance and one concerning which both Houses of Parliament should be entitled to give an opinion. I think legislation is likely to proceed more harmoniously between the two Houses of Parliament if we do not assert our privileges on an occasion of that kind."</quote>
Now, my Lords, if, instead of the words "the condition of the poor," that passage were to be read thus, "With regard to legislation in reference to the economic development of the country," would not the principle, suggested by Lord John Russell apply with equal force to the case now before your Lordships' House?<lb/>
I have dwelt at some little length upon this question because it does seem to me to be one of the most extreme importance, and I really have risen at the beginning of this discussion because I think it might be for your Lordships' convenience if, before proceeding further, we obtain from the noble Earl some statement to indicate whether it is his intention and that of his colleagues to persist in debarring this House from any discussion of these different Amendments upon these what I should call purely technical grounds. I do not know&#x2014;the noble Earl may be able to tell us&#x2014;what prospects there are of any objection which we may be able to raise on this side of the House receiving any consideration at all from His Majesty's Government.
<col>1352</col>
Is the noble Earl asking us to begin with reference to this Bill a mere parade movement, or are we to be allowed to discuss these Amendments upon their merits? My Lords, I do not know whether, considering the atmospheric conditions which prevail at this moment, there is much prospect of our obtaining a hearing in regard to such a question as this. If that is so, then it will be for your Lordships to consider whether there is anything to be gained by the full and careful discussion which these Amendments no doubt in ordinary circumstances would receive. If the noble Earl tells us that what we have to say is not likely to be considered, then I think the House will have to decide whether it desires to persist in its Amendments and take the consequences, or whether, as the Bill is one to which we do not in principle object, we prefer that it should pass into law even without the removal of those blots which we detected in it. But, my Lords, whatever may be the result, I desire to enter my emphatic protest against the manner in which the House of Commons privilege has been made use of, not by the officers of the House, but by the Ministers who control the great majority of the House in order to deny to us the proper opportunity of discussing matters which we were thoroughly entitled to discuss. The noble Earl has told us that we are on the eve of a grave controversy in regard to the relations between the two Houses, and I venture to say that, if such a controversy is indeed to take place, it will be necessary to put in the very forefront of it that question of privilege which I have been endeavouring to discuss&#x2014;a question which, in my view, deserves the earnest attention of all Parliamentary reformers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03714"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess has stated with his invariable clearness and with perfect fairness the condition of things as it has obtained in the House of Commons on the matter of privilege with regard to this particular Bill. The noble Marquess drew a very just distinction, which I have attempted to draw on some previous occasions, between the action of the officers of the other House with regard to this matter of privilege and the possible action of the Government of the day in moving that privilege should be
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0683"/>
<col>1353</col>
waived. I have always, however, endeavoured also to point out that, so far as the position of your Lordships' House in the Constitution is concerned, it is the first point, which is the important one&#x2014;the fact that the officers of the other House may draw attention to a breach of privilege in a particular instance. Whether that privilege should be waived by the House of Commons depends, as it seems to me, on an entirely different matter, namely, on the merits of the particular proposals embodied in the Amendments which your Lordships have made and sent down to another place.<lb/>
Those two things are entirely different, and, speaking generally, I am very far from saying that there may not be on a great number of Bills occasions when the House of Commons on the merits ought to waive its privilege, and ought to agree to your Lordships' Amendments as constituting improvements in a particular Bill. I am quite prepared to lay that down as a general proposition, and I should imagine that, if in years to come your Lordships exercise that function of revision, and, if you like, improvement in the particulars of Bills, some of those improvements may infringe the privileges of another place, and undoubtedly in such a case the House of Commons would be wise not to insist on its privilege.<lb/>
As regards this particular Bill and the question which the noble Marquess put to me at the end of his speech, the position is, of course, a somewhat peculiar one. This Bill is now in the position of a motorcar which is a well-built and well-designed machine, but which has to remain for an indefinite time in its garage because there is no petrol with which to bring it out into the road. This Bill is, of course, as it stands unworkable, because there is no provision for any funds to work it. In those circumstances the question does undoubtedly arise whether it is of immediate importance that it should become law. His Majesty's Government cannot pretend in the circumstances which have taken place to attach at all the same importance to the Bill's becoming law as they would if your Lordships had not taken the action you have with regard to the Supply of the year. I do not think it is likely&#x2014;for I will be quite frank with the noble Marquess&#x2014;that a further interchange of views between the two Houses on this
<col>1354</col>
subject would in the present conditions lead to any useful result. The insistence in another place on their privilege has undoubtedly been marked in this case and in all the circumstances I cannot profess to be altogether surprised at it.<lb/>
So far as one is able to judge, looking back over history, there have been some periods when the House of Commons has been more disposed to insist upon its privileges than in others, partly perhaps owing to the somewhat stricter view taken by the officers of the House for the time being, and partly owing to such circumstances as those in which we are at this moment. I agree that the House of Commons is now, so far as I am able to judge, disposed to insist somewhat strongly upon its privileges, and I admit that the proof of that can be found in the manner in which they have dealt with these particular Amendments. I have stated what I believe the position to be, and I have also stated my view to a certain extent on the general question as between the two Houses; and it now really lies with the House to decide whether, after what I have stated, it desires to take the Amendments one by one, or whether it will take the course which I rather gathered from the noble Marquess, it might be disposed to take&#x2014;that is to say, of insisting on the Amendments made at the previous stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03715"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who leads the House was evidently hard put to it to defend the assertion of privilege of the other House of Parliament which he was obliged to undertake. I was astonished that he could find nothing better to say, if he will allow me to put it so, than that the officers of the other House were to be supreme in this matter, and that if they held that any particular subject was a breach of privilege then it was a breach of privilege and the question whether the House of Commons chose to waive that privilege was a secondary matter which it was entirely within their competence to decide one way of the other. Undoubtedly the decision of the House of Commons on a matter of privilege is subject to the control of that House and is final in that House, but we can never admit, and never ought to admit, that the authority of the officers of the other House of Parliament in any way binds your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0004P0I0684"/>
<col>1355</col>
the noble Marquess to ask for information, as he has been in the House of Commons, and no doubt knows more about this matter than I do. Have there ever been cases in which the House of Commons has against the opinion of its officers, declared that the privileges of the House had not been infringed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03717"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I am unable to answer that question. I ought first to say that the noble Earl does me a great honour in putting the question to me, but I cannot pretend to be an authority on the procedure of the other House, although I sat in it for seventeen years. As the noble Earl knows, the proceedings in that House are very elaborate and intricate and it is difficult to lay down a definite opinion on any particular point. But I would say with some confidence that the officers of the other House, and even the supreme officer, although he occupies a position of unique importance in the Constitution, are only the servants of the House, as the Speaker often finds occasion to say. The authority of the House of Commons in matters of privilege is vested in the House of Commons itself. Of course, a decision of Mr. Speaker is not only of enormous influence in the House of Commons, but is of great weight wherever his words penetrate; but, speaking of a matter of jurisdiction, we must, with the greatest respect to the Speaker of the other House of Parliament, enter a most emphatic protest against the idea that his decisions, with whatever respect we may regard them, in any way bind your Lordships' House. Each House, as the noble Earl himself is aware, is the supreme judge of its own privileges, and there is no appeal except to the country beyond.<lb/>
This case presents a very singular feature. The noble Earl asked me whether there had ever been a case where the House of Commons declared a thing not to be a breach of privilege which the Speaker had declared to be so. I am certainly not able to give him any such case, but this particular instance of the Bill under discussion presents a case somewhat analogous to that, inasmuch as it is a case in which the Speaker has not declared the thing to be a breach of privilege, has indeed almost declined to declare it a breach of privilege, and the House has reversed his decision and said it was a breach of privilege. That is one of the things we have to discuss this afternoon.
<col>1356</col>
Here is actually a case in which, when the Speaker is appealed to and asked whether it is a breach of privilege, his answer was that he had doubts about it and was not able to state definitely that it was a breach of privilege. The actual words were read out by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition just now. The Speaker used the rather significant colloquial phrase that he was not going to "smell out" privilege&#x2014;that is to say, he thought any assertion of privilege in this particular case was actually straining privilege. That was the observation made by that great officer in the House of Commons of whom the noble Earl spoke, and spoke with profound respect. But not only that, my Lords. The Government, in order to exercise a sort of malicious revenge upon your Lordships' House, actually stooped to strike out this Amendment on the ground of privilege which the Speaker himself would not declare was a breach of privilege. I think the noble Earl will agree that that is an assertion of privilege of a very extreme character.<lb/>
I should like to refer to one other Amendment which has also been struck out upon the ground of privilege. Clause 18 deals with the question of unemployment, and on the Second Reading of the Bill in your Lordships' House the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;whose absence, and the cause of it, we greatly deplore&#x2014;stated in the most emphatic terms that he considered anything in the nature of relief works were exceedingly uneconomical and injurious, and that the Government were not in any way in the world to be understood as desiring to establish relief works. That commanded universal assent in all parts of your Lordships' House, and, if I may say so in his absence, so noted a Radical as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, was the mover of the Amendment which struck that clause out of the Bill. It was not a motion made by the aggressive Lords who sit around me&#x2014;not at all. One of the defenders of His Majesty's Government moved to strike this clause out, but we on this side of the House, immoderate and intemperate men as we are, tried to mitigate as far as we could the blow Lord Russell was dealing at His Majesty's Government, and therefore a compromise was moved from this side of the House; but both the noble Earl's Amendment and our compromise have been brushed aside by the House of Commons on the ground of privilege.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0685"/>
<col>1357</col>
Will your Lordships realise, what that means? The difference between the two proposals was this. The Government proposal, put quite shortly, was that in determining what works should be carried out under the Bill regard should be had to unemployment&#x2014;that is that the whole question should be dealt with having regard to the conditions of unemployment. It was pointed out by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and by others, that that proposal created a very great risk of enacting relief works in the Bill, and so the compromise which we proposed, and which your Lordships were good enough to carry, was that although the time of carrying out works might be determined with reference to the demand for employment, the actual determination as to whether there should be works for the unemployed should be independent of that. That was the difference between the proposal of His Majesty's Government and the House of Commons and the proposal to which your Lordships agreed. That compromise was condemned on the ground of a breach of privilege, so that it is positively held that to say works should not be resolved upon with reference to the demands of unemployment is a breach of the privileges of the House of Commons. I do not think it is possible to give a more extreme example in concrete form of the undue extension of the question of privilege than the one I have ventured to give your Lordships to-day, because it is quite clear from that that all questions of employment or unemployment where there is any public money involved, all questions of poor relief, and all questions within the vast domain of public policy, are, according to the decision of the House of Commons, breaches of the privilege of that House. If that position were accepted it would be looked upon as a precedent; indeed, it must be so because the officers of the House are bound by precedent, and every such case in the future would be held to be a breach of privilege, and according to the noble Earl it rests entirely with the House of Commons to decide whether they would insist on such privilege or whether they would waive it.<lb/>
In order to show the extraordinarily capricious character of the action, I am credibly informed that on the night before this extreme assertion of privilege was insisted on in the House of Commons, scores of Amendments made by your Lordships' House to the Assurance Companies Bill, which were equally open to the extreme
<col>1358</col>
assertion of privilege, were accepted by the House of Commons. Under those circumstances I think your Lordships will realise that we on this side of the House are entitled to make the most serious protest against such a proceeding. I do not believe that the relations between the two Houses of Parliament can ever be smoothed and made to work properly if these extreme assertions of privilege are insisted on, and I am sure your Lordships have heard with profound satisfaction that my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition looks forward to a time when these things can be put on a proper footing, without which I am sure the inter-action of the two Houses of Parliament is practically impossible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03718"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say with regard to this Bill, in which I am particularly interested, that I do hope your Lordships will pass the Bill into law. The Leader of the House has asserted that there is no petrol with which to work the machinery of the Bill, but the Bill contains provisions as to how the money is to be provided, and I am quite content to wait until the time comes when the necessary funds are available. This Bill is desired by motorists generally throughout the country; &#x00A3;250,000 has been collected by the petrol tax, and motorists were assured that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would carry out the undertaking given in the other House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03719"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to raise a protest against passing this Bill as a machinery Bill in order that if the money should be forthcoming at a future time these regulations for the improvement of road and motor car traffic may come about. I want to protest against the setting up of such machinery. I think in the discussion we had in your Lordships' House on the Bill it was pretty generally agreed that there was a very strong feeling in the country against this legislation for motorists only. I need not recapitulate any of the arguments then put forward. Your Lordships will remember that there were protests from the united county councils of England and Scotland against some of the main principles of the Bill. There is not the least necessity now, as I say, to go into these points further, but might I just take up one other curious reason for which the House of Commons has rejected some of the Amendments put forward by this House? It objects to the Amendment to Clause 8,
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0686"/>
<col>1359</col>
page 6, because it would alter the purposes for which advances may be made out of the Road Improvement Grant. The Amendment which your Lordships made to Clause 8 of the Bill added to the purposes in respect of which the Road Hoard might make advances to highway authorities that of contributing towards the extraordinary expenditure incurred in the maintenance of roads in consequence of motor traffic. That is objected to on the ground of privilege. When this Bill was first brought into the House of Commons it dealt with motor traffic, and by your Amendment your Lordships were merely carrying out the original idea of the framers of the Bill. This seems to me to amount almost to a constitutional point, because apparently the House of Commons is able at any period of a debate to alter the whole construction of the Bill and we are unable to make any Amendment. If that is so we would be like a dog barking behind a carriage. As soon as they altered the Bill in one direction we should have to bark in that direction, and then at a subsequent period they might alter it again and we would have to bark in that direction. Really, my Lords, that seems to me to be a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.</membercontribution></p>

Supposing that there are Amendments which are disagreed with in another place on another ground, on the ground of their merits as well as on the ground of privilege, is it not the case that the reason which is alleged for disagreement when it comes back to your Lordships' House is invariably the question of privilege rather than the question of merit? Why that may be so, I do not know. Noble Lords who sit on this side of the House know that however much we may urge merit with regard to an Amendment that plea is not always treated with the consideration which we think it deserves, and it may be that in another place it is thought that the assertion of privilege is more likely to meet with respect. The noble Marquess quoted what was said by Mr. Speaker in connection with Clause 8, and made much of the fact that Mr. Speaker then said that he did not wish to "smell out" these breaches of privilege. If the noble Marquess will inquire I think he will find that the Amendment with regard to Clause 8 was not a very important one. We do not deny for a moment that, with regard to these Amendments on Clause 8, Mr. Speaker seems to have treated them on a somewhat different footing from the others, but if the noble Marquess is content to accept without demur in the future the fact that when Mr. Speaker asserts that a breach of privilege has taken place that that is so, the arguments in this House will be very much simplified. The noble Marquess might have strengthened his argument about the way in which His Majesty's Government do accept Amendments which might be
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0687"/>
<col>1361</col>
considered privileged by reference to another Bill, the Asylums Officers Bill which was discussed in another place a night or two ago. In chat case His Majesty's Government more than once waived the question of privilege. I say that in order to show that His Majesty's Government do not wish to stand too strictly on the letter of the law, but wish to consider in this matter the question of merit as well as privilege.</membercontribution></p>

The most important purpose for which conditions are laid down by Statute is for the construction of light railways. Those conditions are contained in Section 5 of the Act of 1896, but under the Light Railways Act advances can be made to companies trading for profit, and conditions that might be proper in such a case are not necessarily proper where, as in this Bill, associations and companies trading for profit are excluded from among those bodies to whom advances may be made.</membercontribution></p>

It is, on the contrary, a clause which would enable them, if they themselves felt that the issue was one of sufficient importance to resort to this special procedure which would to some extent relieve them of responsibility and give a wider publicity to the question at issue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03765"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The reason why this Amendment is objected to by His Majesty's Government is briefly this. I think it was a subsection which was moved by the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown. We think the subsection unnecessary for the reason that the money guaranteed by the Bill for the purposes of development is only &#x00A3;2,500,000 to be spread over five years. There are a number of years given to the Commissioners for development purposes, but if they were to inaugurate any very large scheme they would be obliged to get further money from Parliament, and in that way Parliamentary control would be secured. Under the Bill as it stands the sums of money expended will not be sufficiently large to make this recourse to Parliament necessary.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03779"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: This Amendment is one which proposes that the Road Board should be empowered to make advances to highway authorities towards meeting the extra cost of repairing the roads due to motor traffic. I think your Lordships will see that that would mean that at any rate part of the Road Improvement Grant might be used for the purpose of reducing the existing charges on the rates. Similar proposals were made when the Bill was in another place, but they were resisted on the ground that the whole principle of the Road Improvement Grant would be violated if it was allowed to be used for that purpose&#x2014;that is to say, for the relief of rates. The essential purpose of the fund is development, and it is obvious that if the grant is used for the relief of rates development would not substantially benefit, whereas if it is made applicable only to the construction of new roads and the improvement of existing roads some substantial benefit might be expected from the expenditure of the money, probably more beneficial than if it went in relief of rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03780"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It might have been inferred by a superficial listener to the noble Earl that the money would be necessarily diverted from development if the Lords Amendment were insisted upon. That, of course, is not the case. It is only an enabling provision. It enables the local authority, if they think fit, to spend part of the money in the maintenance of those roads which have been destroyed by this new motor traffic, which is really, of course, the very origin of this part of the Bill. The Government
<col>1366</col>
has chosen to refuse the Amendment. I am perfectly confident that the only part of the Bill which the great mass of the local ratepayers will care to have is that part which was inserted by your Lordships. I speak not only as a member of this House but as a member of a county council, and I knew quite well what the local ratepayers suffer from. They consider it an intolerable grievance that their rates should be raised through the destruction of the roads by other people's motors, motors which do not belong to the county and which pay nothing to the resources of the county. That is the grievance. It has put up the rates in my county many thousands of pounds, and this clause would give some relief to the ratepayers. Your Lordships' House desired to give that relief, but the Government has refused to give it, and I earnestly hope that when they have an opportunity of expressing their opinion the ratepayers will remember who are their friends.</membercontribution></p>

I am afraid I am out of order in answering that question now. With regard to this Amendment, your Lordships will see that it enabled any county council which objected to the construction of a new road by the Road Board to require procedure by way of Provisional Order.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03828"><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that your Lordships insist upon the retention of your Amendment to Clause 19. This clause has nothing whatever to do with privilege. The Amendments which were introduced by your Lordships were for the purpose of safeguarding commons and open spaces for the benefit of the masses of the people. It has sometimes been said that your Lordships take more interest in land than in any other subject, but it cannot be said that in this matter your Amendments are in any way connected with selfish interest. You are defending the interest of the poorest classes, and why the Government should go out of its way to strike out such Amendments is to me incomprehensible. For over fifty years the trend of legislation has been in the direction of safeguarding open spaces in the public interest, and I for one have devoted the greater part of my life to that object. Open spaces were proposed to be taken by the Commissioners for the purpose of afforestation and for making roads. An Amendment dealing with the latter object, moved by Lord Clinton, has safeguarded roads, but why should commons be covered with plantations? Who has asked for them? I have not met with a single individual who thought the Government proposal necessary, or seen a single line in any newspaper asking for such a thing. It is said that reasonable access will be afforded, but who, with any knowledge of what afforestation means, will put forward that contention? Afforestation means planting for beauty or for profit. If the planting is to be for beauty that means the planting of single trees, and certainly that is not intended. What is meant is the planting of portions of common land for profit. Not many of your Lordships will say that your attempts at afforestation have been profitable ventures. I, like others, have planted, because I think it will be for the good of the country, but my books show that I have not profited by it. It is not possible to grant access to planted land if the trees are intended to prosper; there will have to be close planting, and the land will have to be fenced. Suburban and metropolitan commons, it is said, are safeguarded. They are not safeguarded. There are portions of Epping Forest which are
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0692"/>
<col>1371</col>
under rural jurisdiction, and this Bill only says metropolitan and suburban commons. Metropolitan means fifteen miles from the centre of London; suburban means five miles from a thickly-populated district; and there are many most useful commons such as Epping Forest, portions of which are open and which the verderers do not want to plant because they are of use to the public. I know the verderers are exceedingly anxious about this, and so also are the City of London, and I do hope your Lordships will insist on your Amendment for the sake of the public. In the other House this Amendment was supported, among others, by Sir Charles Dilke, who spoke strongly of the need of safeguarding our public spaces, and with due respect to His Majesty's Government, I do hope they will not insist on striking out your Lordships' Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03830"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the opinion of His Majesty's Government is that the clause as originally introduced provides an adequate safeguard for these open spaces which noble Lords on this side of the House are as anxious to keep open as the noble Earl himself. The subject has been carefully considered in consultation with the Commons Preservation Society, and the clause is assented to both by that Society and by the Government. In these circumstances I think the noble Earl may rest content, without fear of undue encroachment upon common rights. The effect of the Amendment the noble Earl wishes to retain will be to prevent the compulsory acquisition of any common land except by means of a Provisional Order, introducing thus an unnecessary safeguard, because there is nothing in this Bill likely to demand any very large acquisition of land of that kind. In view of the fact that the Commons Preservation Society, which is a society of experts, were content with the Bill as originally introduced, I venture to hope your Lordships will not press the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

If the Amendment goes too far, surely the Government might suggest some less objectionable formula. In the opinion of all interested in the preservation of commons the Bill, without the Amendment, will leave some of the most interesting and important commons highly vulnerable. Representations have been made to me in particular in reference to Epping Forest to the effect that, if the Bill remains as it is, there will be nothing to prevent the forest being disfigured by unsightly thoroughfares driven through the most interesting parts of it, and by the planting of formal plantations entirely out of harmony with the surroundings, which as each year goes by, under the present admirable management, become more beautiful and more valuable to the public.

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03862"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before this Motion is passed, may I, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Londonderry, who is unavoidably absent at this moment, say a word or two with regard to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904. Strong representations have been made to my noble friend from newspaper proprietors about this Bill being put into the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. It is well known that Bills that go into the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill get passed by both Houses at the end of the session, and are very apt to
<col>1376</col>
go through without any discussion and without any attention being drawn to their provisions, and the newspaper proprietors wish to enter a protest against this Bill being put into the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. They anticipate that very great developments will take place in the near future in wireless telegraphy, which affects them very considerably, and being, as it is a monopoly of the Post Office they think that that Bill ought to be brought up separately so that there may be a full opportunity for discussion in both Houses of Parliament as to these new developments. My noble friend Lord Londonderry does not desire to press for an undertaking that it should come up separately next session, because I do not suppose that His Majesty's Government would care to give any undertaking as to what may happen in the next session of Parliament, but I think I might ask for some expression of opinion about this Bill, and some indication that His Majesty's Government do not think it unreasonable that this question of wireless telegraphy should be dealt with outside the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and that an opportunity should be given for full discussion and for those who are competent to do so to state their opinions on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03863"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had something to do in the first instance with
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0695"/>
<col>1377</col>
this Bill. It was originally introduced by me at the close of the session in another place, and was got through as an agreed Bill. There was an express stipulation then that it should be put into the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, because it was felt that there were likely to be so many developments occurring in wireless telegraphy in the course of the next few years that it would be a pity to make a permanent Statute of something which might require alteration. It was therefore introduced by me and passed through both Houses of Parliament, and it was put into the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. It was amended, if I remember aright, at Mr. Sydney Buxton's instigation two years afterwards, and it has expressly been put into the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill so that every year it should come up and there should be an opportunity for dealing with any new features which have arisen. I do not think that your Lordships could possibly consent to any Bill being taken out of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill and made a Bill renewable every year. It has either got to be placed permanently on the Statute Book, or, as in this case, put in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, which does give an opportunity to members of both Houses to raise any question of interest that comes up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03864"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: On behalf of Lord Granard, who represents the Post Office, I wish to say a word in reply to the, noble Earl, Lord Plymouth although I think that his remarks have been entirely dealt with by the noble Earl, Lord Derby, and that I am absolved from saying anything more in the matter. I would only like to add this to what Lord Derby has said, that in view of the Radio-Telegraphy Convention and the purchase of the Marconi stations by the Government, it might be necessary to alter the Act, and in that case a more definite and comprehensive measure might be introduced.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03881"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House do agree with the new Clause D which is printed in italics on the Paper issued to your Lordships. Perhaps it may be permissible for me, in making this Motion, to explain very briefly why the Government propose to take up this position. My noble friend the Lord Steward pointed out, in the discussion on the Development Bill, that the Government are at a disadvantage in these discussions from the fact that the Amendments to which they have either here or in another place agreed are not brought to your Lordships' notice on this the last occasion on which these Bills will be before your Lordships, at any rate this session; but I do not think it is necessary for me to quote particular Amendments to support the statement that the House of Commons have, on the earlier occasions during which this Bill has been before them, accepted various Amendments which your Lordships proposed to this Bill, and which have, in effect, substituted for the original compounding system the scheme of compounding which now finds a place in the Bill founded on the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892. While acquiescing in these changes I must remind your Lordships that the Government at the time agreed to them with some reluctance, which they indeed entertain still, as to the wisdom of these changes. They are not satisfied that the arrangements proposed will be entirely satisfactory, but, as I have said, they have accepted the change. There is one thing, however, to which they find themselves unable to agree, the effect of which would be in their opinion to hamper the free operation of this Bill by retaining in their entirety the existing statutory provisions
<col>1380</col>
relating to the payment of poor rate as a qualification for franchise.<lb/>
I entered so fully into this matter on a previous occasion that I may possibly be excused from again enlarging upon it; but I may remind your Lordships that this change, to the necessity of which the Government adhere, was found necessary in England when the same question was raised and decided in the year 1869. It was then provided that payment of poor rates by an owner under a system of compounding should qualify the occupier for the Parliamentary franchise. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton, on the last occasion when we discussed this Bill, pointed out that the comparison with England was weakened in his view by the fact that this Bill contained higher provisions for rent of the houses than the English provisions to which I have drawn your Lordships' attention. But I think the noble Lord has forgotten that, under the occupancy franchise of the Reform Bill of 1832, in all houses of &#x00A3;10 and upwards personal individual payment of poor rates is not insisted upon as a qualification for franchise. A full system for compounding is permitted in houses of &#x00A3;4 and under, so that there is, I think, very little weight at all in the contention of the noble Lord so far as principle is concerned. We are still dealing, as we were at first, with occupiers of houses of a rental of &#x00A3;5, &#x00A3;6, &#x00A3;7, &#x00A3;8, and &#x00A3;9, and &#x00A3;9 is, if I remember aright, the exact limit of the compounding provisions in England. So it does remain true that in principle this matter has been settled for England as the Government wish to settle it now for Scotland, so long ago as 1869, on precisely the lines which the Government wish to take up on the present occasion. Your Lordships did not take that view. The Bill was returned to the House of Commons containing a clause the practical effect of which would be, in the opinion of those qualified to advise, to disfranchise a large number of persons who would have in fact paid their poor rate with their rent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03882"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord kindly explain to us how it will disfranchise anybody?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03884"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Then what the noble Lord means is that it will not enfranchise.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0697"/>
<col>1381</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03885"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: No, I mean by the operation of the Bill there would be practical disfranchisement of persons who now enjoy the franchise. An occupier must pay his poor rate by June 20&#x2014;that is to say, before the obligation imposed on the owner arises, and it is obvious that he will have to face one of three courses. First, he will have to give up the advantages of this Bill, to give up the adoption of a system of short lets which your Lordships purport to be giving him by this Bill, he will have to go on in the old way taking his house by the year and paying his rate direct. That is one alternative. Another alternative is that he shall pay the rate twice over, that he shall go on paying his instalments and at the same time have to pay direct to the authority the whole rate for the year with what power of recovery he can find, and, as I pointed out to your Lordships on a previous occasion, if he has removed he may even be paying instalments on his rent in a new house. That is the second alternative. The third alternative which is before him is to refuse to compound with his landlord who has every inducement under this Bill to institute a system of compounding with all his tenants. With this variety of courses before him and with the dislocation which undoubtedly this will impose on the collection of rates by parish councils, there can be nothing but confusion if the noble Lord's clauses are still retained and insisted upon in this Bill. I have heard no reason whatever except this particular fear that the noble Lord has about the franchise, no justification whatever for separating in treatment the poor rate from the other rates. Suitable facilities are given in this Bill as regards other rates with the direct object of facilitating the working of the Bill with regard to the introduction of a system of short lets. The effect of the provisions regarding the poor rate, as I do not think the noble Lord can possibly deny although he may think they are necessary for other reasons, must be to have a direct opposite influence and tendency&#x2014;namely, to discourage the adoption of the very system which the majority of your Lordships profess to wish to introduce.<lb/>
I know the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, has on previous occasions objected to my characterising his scheme as compounding. He says it is not compounding because he goes first to the occupier; the liability is laid first upon he occupier to pay the rates, and after the occupier comes the owner.
<col>1382</col>
Compounding is a system under which the owner pays the rates with the right of recovery against the tenant. It will be perfectly legal under the noble Lord's clause for that to go on. He himself says that he wishes to encourage voluntary arrangements, which shows that the very system which operates in England will be a perfectly legal course in Scotland under the noble Lord's proposals. There are two very strong inducements which he leaves in the Bill towards the adoption of that course. In the first place parish councils must be considered. Parish councils will want, in the presence of these short lets and frequent, removals of working men, as good security as they can for the payment of their rates; they will look to the best security, no matter in what order the noble Lord places it. It cannot be denied that the owners of the houses, who do not remove monthly or quarterly or half-yearly, must inevitably be considered by parish councils a sounder and safer security for the payment of the rates than working men who may remove under this Bill at very short periods. What is more, the noble Earl explicitly allows parish councils the right of recovering against the owners for rates. Then there is the question of the tenants. The tenants want to pay their rates with their rental. Your Lordships allow them to pay their municipal rates with their rental, but you refuse to allow them to pay their poor rates with their rental, except with the heavy penalties which the noble Lord adds in his clause requiring that the whole poor rate of the year shall be paid by June 20. My Lords, I have little hope that anything I can say will alter your Lordships' mind on this matter, but you are, unintentionally I have no doubt, inflicting a very serious injustice upon a large body of people in Scotland by these provisions. As a matter of fact, the large majority of people affected by this Bill are men who have under the present system, with the inconvenience which they have hitherto suffered and which this Bill seeks to remove, paid both their rent and their rates on a yearly system and up to now have thereby qualified for the franchise. Why should they not be qualified under the new system? You are saying to these people, "For your convenience Parliament is now going to give you what you have asked for, a system of short lets with power to remove, as they have in England without losing the right to the franchise." Why should you inflict now upon them this risk of losing their right to vote? Let me remind
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0698"/>
<col>1383</col>
your Lordships that this matter was not raised in the House of Commons in the first place; it was not discussed in the House of Commons until it had been raised in your Lordships' House. It was never put forward as an objection to this Bill by the Opposition in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03886"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Oh, yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03887"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think not, but if I am wrong I am, of course, open to correction. The noble Earl insists on this, and your Lordships have supported him because it might enfranchise a few people who under the old system would not have been enfranchised. Otherwise, he cannot fairly call this an enfranchising measure. Now, who are these few people? They are people who the noble Lord imagines will have paid instalments of rates with their rent not covering the whole year and who will find themselves on the register of voters. In the first place, these are a very small and disproportionate minority of those whom this Bill seeks to benefit. In the second place, to support his theory the noble Earl must suppose that the removal of each of these men who are to be enfranchised is to take place within the same Parliamentary division. As a matter of fact, he knows that there will be a directly opposite tendency under this Bill. If you give people an elastic system which will allow them to give up their house in Glasgow and go to Belfast because shipbuilding happens to be slack in Glasgow and flourishing in Belfast, that will have the direct effect of encouraging removals, and will therefore operate to reduce the number of working men who are placed on the roll. The noble Earl has said that he will not allow the Franchise Acts to be interfered with. I do submit that that is an evasion of the real point which I seek to put before your Lordships&#x2014;that a number of men who are, perfectly properly, under the present system allowed to exercise the franchise will be disfranchised by the system you are now insisting upon.<lb/>
All the experience which we have both in England and Scotland shows that you cannot have a system of short lets, as they are called, unless you have compounding in some form. The noble Earl accepts compounding in principle although I know the distinction which he draws between one system and another. My Lords, you
<col>1384</col>
are meting out to Scotland a harder measure than you have hitherto meted out to England, and I am only expressing the view of the Government when I say that we feel strongly that it is taking an unfair advantage of the necessities of working men who will benefit by this system to impose upon them a disability which the Amendment of your Lordships must inevitably impose upon them. If your Lordships are not prepared to agree to the clause as now sent up from the House of Commons I fear there will be no prospect of placing upon the Statute Book an Act which is very anxiously desired by a great number of the working-classes in Scotland. I may point out to your Lordships that the Government have been most anxious that no opportunity should be lost of endeavouring to place this Bill upon the Statute Book. The new Clause D which has now come up from another place differs very little from the original Clause D which was sent to the House of Commons by your Lordships' House, but it does differ sufficiently to leave the door open to your Lordships if you so will to refuse your assent to the Bill. But I would again venture to assert that if you decline to assent to what the Government now propose your Lordships are denying to Scotland what Parliament gave forty years ago to England, and the sense of unequal treatment and injustice, which is thereby conveyed, will assuredly remain and be heard of in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03888">Moved, That this House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment inserted in lieu of new Clause D.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Pentland</i>).</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03889"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suppose I am correct in inferring that unless the House agrees to drop its own Amendments and to accept this Clause D, the Government will not proceed with the Bill. I very deeply regret that decision. The Government in taking that course are giving up a Bill which deals with an admitted grievance in house-letting simply because the House is not prepared so to alter the conditions on which rates are paid as to place upon the Parliamentary register persons who might never have paid their rates at all. Let it be clear, therefore, that it is on one point only&#x2014;that in regard to rating&#x2014;that the Government are prepared to drop their Bill. Its purpose is to make illegal certain arrangements made between some owners of houses and their tenants which made it necessary to take
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0699"/>
<col>1385</col>
houses for long periods before they are actually required, and to give security that they would be occupied for at least a year. That was an undoubted grievance which was dealt with by this Bill, and not a word in the measure relating to house-letting or the grievances which are connected with house-letting has been altered in any way by your Lordships' House. The Bill as it came to this House' was in a state of great confusion. Grave exception was taken to it by Scottish municipal authorities, and great cure was bestowed upon it both in your Lordships' House and outside in order to make the Bill a workable measure. So anxious were we to accept, as far as was possible, the Amendments of the House of Commons that against our own better judgment we agreed to parish councils being brought into the Bill, thereby for the first time giving those authorities power to recover rates from the owners of houses; but we said that the scheme must be carried out in such a way as not to interfere with the law relating to the franchise. That was the sole alteration which your Lordships made in regard to this matter. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland said that the franchise question was not discussed in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03890"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: It was not first raised in that House, was what I said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03891"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: It was raised on the Report stage of the Bill in the other House, and Sir F. Banbury moved an Amendment which was practically the same as that which your Lordships inserted. It was discussed at considerable length, and Mr. Ure said it was because the Government desired that the measure should not be a Franchise Bill that they could not accept that Amendment. If those words had been used by anybody but Mr. Ure only one possible meaning could be attached to them; but in regard to Mr. Ure's utterances it is necessary to see what other possible construction can be placed upon them. What in charity it might be supposed that Mr. Ure meant was that, although he did not alter the law in regard to the franchise, in so many words, he was going to alter the law in regard to the payment of rates in such a way as to get round the franchise law and place upon the Parliamentary register persons who might not have paid their rates. If the words are taken literally there is no doubt they are absolutely incorrect.
<col>1386</col>
According to the noble Lord, and according to the meaning which is placed upon it by Mr. Ure, he has reinstated compounding certainly in fact, and almost in words, just exactly as it would have been if we had left the original clause in, because Mr. Ure in this Amendment which your Lordships are asked to adopt inserts words which would attach an interpretation to Clause 345 of the Burgh Police Act, 1892, which is not in accordance with the interpretation given to that clause up to the present time. Moreover, the noble Lord said that this is a matter of extreme injustice to the working man. That is not contended even by their own supporters. Mr. Barnes, who, I believe, was the originator of this whole matter, said the other day in the House of Commons&#x2014;
<quote>"So far as these rating provisions go, that is a matter upon which the working man does not feel keenly."</quote>
I quite agree with him. I do not believe the working man does feel it keenly, and I cannot for the life of me understand what the noble Lord means when he says we disfranchise people. Your Lordships have disfranchised nobody. We leave the law exactly as it is. A person who pays his rates is now entitled to have his name upon the register and will continue to have exactly the same right as at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03892"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl continue the quotation from Mr. Barnes, so that we may get his full meaning?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03893"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Mr. Barnes proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"Yet I am glad to find that the Lord Advocate has disagreed with this Amendment of the Lords, which would have had the effect of disfranchising a good many men."</quote>
I will put to Mr. Barnes exactly the same question that I put to the noble Lord, and I shall be much obliged if he will answer it: "Whom do we disfranchise?" We do not alter the law in any kind of way. If a man by paying his rates at the present time in connection with his rent is entitled to get on the register, that right remains to him exactly as it is at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03894"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Earl deny that that right is accompanied by the difficulties, if you like to use the word, or, as I describe it, the penalties, which this clause attaches to the exercise of that right in future?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03895"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The person at present entitled to be on the register will continue to have the same rights as he has at the present moment, whatever those rights happen to be. We do not enlarge those rights, we simply leave the law as it is. As the noble Lord said, it is very hard on a man who pays his rates in connection with his rent to be disqualified, but if your Lordships will look at the clause in the Bill as it went from this House you will see that we did go the length of saying that any man who paid his rates in his rent and whose owner did not pay them should, on receiving notice, have a right to pay those rates himself and to deduct them from the rent, and that meets the exact case which the noble Lord has put. I am very glad the noble Lord has given us his reasons to-day. I must say that they were given much more fully and much more satisfactorily to my mind than on previous occasions. But, my Lords, I wish to reiterate this, that your Lordships have in no way touched anything which relates to the house-letting portion of the Bill and that so far as that is concerned it departs from this House quite as favourable to the new occupier as it entered it. That is all I wish to say with regard to this Amendment. I greatly regret that the noble Lord is determined to drop the Bill. All I can say is, the responsibility of dropping it rests with the Government and with them alone. With regard to the house-letting portion of it, as the Bill is apparently to be dropped, I do wish to give a word of advice to house-owners. I took a considerable amount of trouble to examine into their relative rights and the claims of municipalities and others, and therefore I do feel that I am able to offer a word of advice with regard to the house-letting portion of the Bill, which I believe is the really valuable part and the part which occupiers care most about. I venture to hope that house-owners will be wise enough although the Bill does not become law, to themselves carry out the house-letting sections of it in their entirety. I believe, if they do that, there will be nothing more heard with regard to these rating provisions. If I were a house-owner that is the course I should take, and I venture to think if my suggestion is adopted these disagreements will be met by private arrangement, and this appears to me to be a much better way of settling these matters than by the provisions of a Statute.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1388</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03896"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say one or two words on the principle that underlies this measure, because I think it important that the position of noble Lords on this side of the House who are connected with Scotland should be made perfectly clear. I think also the position of your Lordships' House generally should be made clear. We are entirely in agreement with the main objects of the Bill. The noble Lord, the Secretary for Scotland, has admitted that. We are in favour of the alteration in the system of house letting because we know quite well that the present system of letting for long periods is an undoubted hardship upon a large number of occupiers, who, owing to some change in their employment, have to leave their houses before the expiration of their term and may have to pay a full year's rent. But there are many details in the Bill with regard to which we disagree with His Majesty's Government for reasons which we have stated perfectly clearly and which were supported by persons in Scotland best qualified to deal with the matter, and who would have had to do with the carrying out of the Bill if it had passed. We moved Amendments, with regard to every one of which we have given way with the exception of the Amendment which is now the subject of discussion as to the principle, and it is a big principle, of compounding.<lb/>
The matter really is a very simple one. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland described perfectly correctly, but in most complicated language, the effect of the Amendment before your Lordships' House. The system of compounding is vastly important, first of all because, whatever may be said to the contrary, the Bill alters the whole basis of the principle on which our franchise rests. It rests on two qualifications&#x2014;on residence and on payment of rates. The payment of rates with regard to a considerable number of houses disappears as a qualification. It is really so great a change that I think it is perfectly reasonable that we should have asked the Government to state fully and clearly their intentions and their objects in this part of the Bill and not to have brought in this big change of the franchise as a side issue. If the Bill had passed in the form which the Government desire we would have an entirely different franchise in the burghs and in the country districts, and considerable inconvenience would be caused. In some
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0701"/>
<col>1389</col>
divisions you get two different qualifications, the burgh occupier, who is not bound to pay rates, and the country occupier, who is bound to pay rates. That is a state of things obviously unfair to the country occupier, who is placed in a worse position than the burgh occupier.<lb/>
These compounding clauses we claim are not necessary to the Bill; they are really an excrescence upon the Bill, put in for some purpose of the Government. I know the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland does not agree with that. He says it is essential to any system of house letting that you should institute also a system of compounding. I do not want to go over this ground again. I stated on a former occasion that although that was the view of the Secretary for Scotland it was not the view of Lord Guthrie's Departmental Committee which took a very considerable amount of evidence on the matter. Of course, if the Government choose to risk this Bill for considerations which really have nothing to do with the Bill, then the measure, as the noble Lord said, will be lost. But I think it does show very little desire on the part of the Government to pass the measure when they are willing to lose it because they have failed to get established a principle of compounding which every authority has condemned and which a Departmental Committee have stated is not essential to the carrying out of the Bill. There is absolutely no attempt to defend compounding upon its merits. It has been condemned by every authority&#x2014;by Royal Commissions, by Departmental Committees, by those who are working among the poor, and I think within the last year by noble Lords on both sides of your Lordships' House. It is condemned as demoralising to the poor themselves, because it must and does take away the interest of every man who so compounds for rates in the proper carrying out of the local government of the place in which he resides. His rent remains fixed from year to year, and he has no knowledge of or interest in the way in which the expenditure of his district and the government is carried on. It takes away from him the true sense of responsibility of citizenship which your Lordships are anxious to place upon everybody in the country, and it does lead to very great extravagance in municipal expenditure. There is complaint everywhere of the enormous amount of municipal indebtedness which is being created and which is becoming
<col>1390</col>
so great as to be almost a national danger. That extravagance in expenditure we notice to a very much greater extent in England than we do in Scotland, because in Scotland we have not at present the same system of compounding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03897"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The objection that has been taken to the system of compounding has been entirely on the question of the franchise. The noble Lord cannot ride two horses. Noble Lords who oppose the Bill as we would have it have accepted compounding in principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03898"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: On that we absolutely disagree. We say it is not compounding, and the noble Lord says it is. We shall never come to an agreement on that head.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03899"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will not deny that compounding is a perfectly legal operation under the Bill as he would have it&#x2014;that the owners should pay the rates by compounding up to the full limit, and he will not dispute the desirability of voluntary arrangements being come to to that effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03900"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: Exactly. Under the Amendments to the Bill these things can be done in cases of agreement, and in cases of agreement only. Just one more thing. I believe it is apparent that we shall lose the Bill. I regret it exceedingly, but it is not essential, even for next year's purposes, that the Bill should pass at this moment. We are apparently on the eve of a General Election, and one Party or another will be returned to power, whether it is the Party of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House or the party of noble Lords opposite. In the latter case they may be returned in a more chastened spirit and more ready to accept Amendments from your Lordships' House, and there is no reason why this same measure, with the exception of compounding, should not be pressed through all its stages without any difficulty whatever in a few days next session in time to affect next year's house letting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03901"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish very shortly to endorse the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Camperdown. This Bill seems to me to be not a House Letting Bill but an enfranchising Bill. The effect of Clause D would be to enfranchise
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0702"/>
<col>1391</col>
a man in spite of the fact that he might not intend to pay one penny of the rates of the house which constitutes his qualification. Your Lordships have met the Government in every respect, and we are prepared to meet the Government in every respect now, except one, which has no bearing on the Bill. We only object to an owner being compelled to enfranchise a compounding ratepayer who may not even pay his rates. It is with some diffidence that I question an assertion made by the Lord Advocate, but as to his statement that the Amendments which were sent down to the Commons would have disfranchised any occupier, I really cannot understand it, and I cannot understand it even now after the explanation from the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland. I would ask the noble Lord how and under what Act would we have disfranchised anybody? Is it under the existing Scottish law as to the franchise, or is it under some new franchise which is contemplated by this Bill? The noble Lord's justification for this change apparently is that he is applying the English Act to Scotland&#x2014;the Poor Kate Assessment and Collection Act of 1869; but, as my noble friend Lord Clinton has already pointed out, the compounding clauses in that Act have been condemned by every competent authority in the country, and I cannot conceive why they should be applied under different conditions, as they are, to Scotland. If this Bill were passed into law, as amended by the House of Commons, we should abolish the franchise disqualification for non-payment of rates in every burgh throughout the country. If the Government wish to after the franchise, they should bring in a Franchise Bill. The attitude of the Lord Advocate with regard to this question has been very clearly shown in his replies to Sir Frederick Banbury. I do not wish to go into the question of the Amendment moved by Sir Frederick Banbury except to point out that it only dealt with this question of franchise; it did not interfere in any way with any of the proposals as regards house letting; it did not interfere with the question of compounding, it dealt only with the franchise; but the Government refused to consider that Amendment just as, ever since, they have refused to consider any Amendment which is designed to protect the present franchise law of Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03902"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord
<col>1392</col>
asked me to point out to him how this could be fairly characterised as a disfranchising proposal. I have already explained my view on that point to your Lordships, but I will put this very briefly to him. If persons avail themselves of the proposals of this Bill in regard to having shorter lets for their houses, it will undoubtedly be more difficult for them under the clauses of the noble Earl opposite than it is now to qualify themselves for the exercise of the Parliamentary vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03903"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: How?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03904"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to detain your Lordships. It would not be right, after the courtesy you have extended to me this afternoon, that I should say anything more on this subject, but if I might be permitted to reply to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton, who enlarged on the system of compounding and the difficulties which would be introduced owing to the disparity of the position between country voters and burgh voters. I would put it to him that all those difficulties have already been faced in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03905"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: And failed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03906"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am talking of facts; the noble Lord is talking of opinions. Forty years ago none of these objections were thought strong enough to bar the way to granting to the people of England what we are asking should be granted to Scotland and to Scottish working men. The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, was good enough to give some advice to the house-owners. Let me remind him of the progress this Bill has made. I think when he first took it in hand in this House he put two or three different sets of Amendments on the Paper before he arrived at a conclusion. The last set went through three editions and that brought him to the point where the Government started from in the introduction of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03907"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Oh, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03908"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: In my opinion it did. I may tell the noble Lord that nearly two years ago, with all the influence I can command from the position which I hold, I uttered the same warning to the house-owners without any effect, and I can
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0703"/>
<col>1393</col>
only say that the insistence of your Lordships in destroying this measure seems to me to throw a very curious light upon your confidence in referring any question to the judgment of the people.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE THORNEY ESTATE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03912"><member>LORD NEWTON</member> rose to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether his attention had been called to a letter written by Mr. Rowland Prothero, from the Bedford Office, with reference to the sale of the Thorney Estate, which appeared in the Press on Monday the 29th of November; and whether the statements made with regard to the action of the Board of Agriculture were correct.</p>
<col>1394</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03913">On Question, whether the House do agree with the Commons in the said Amendment?</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03914">Their Lordships divided: Contents; 21; Not-contents, 38.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03915">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in putting this Question to the President of the Board of Agriculture I must express my great regret that I have brought him here under circumstances extremely inconvenient to himself, and I should like to offer him my gratitude for being present under the circumstances. It is not necessary for me to enter in detail into this particular question. The Thorney estate is noticeable for two reasons. In the first place it is an example cited by the noble Earl opposite of an appreciation in value which has arisen since the present Government assumed office, and, in the second place, it enjoys another distinction inasmuch as it cannot possibly be described as land which has been stolen from the people, because, as everybody knows by this time, the estate was created many years ago out of marshes and land reclaimed from the sea. Since the year 1816, when it was acquired by the Duke of Bedford's predecessor, a sum of nearly two millions has been spent upon it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03916">My noble friend the Duke of Bedford a short time ago made up his mind&#x2014;I believe solely for public reasons&#x2014;to sell this property to the sitting tenants, and he offered to leave a large portion of the purchase
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0704"/>
<col>1395</col>
money on mortgage. Thereupon the most astonishing thing took place. These miserable down-trodden tenants, whose spirit, presumably, had been broken by generations of servitude under Dukes, instead of manifesting joy at their deliverance from this thraldom, showed an exactly opposite feeling, and begged to be allowed to remain on as tenants at increased rents. Thereupon the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture stepped into the arena as the <i>deus ex machina</i> and opened up negotiations for the purchase of part, at all events, of the property. But two serious obstacles presented themselves. The first was that the rents were so low that the noble Earl was not able to show what, in the opinion of the Government, would be a satisfactory profit on the transaction. I believe the noble Duke's rents represented a profit of something like two per cent. It was, therefore, intimated to the noble Earl, I understand, by his colleagues that he must really show something better than that, and must realise something like four per cent. The second difficulty arose from the fact that the property happened, unfortunately for the Government, to belong to a Duke. As we all know, although we are rather tired of the subject by now, Dukes are the principal weapon in the armoury of the Government at the present time, and the more acute and shrewder members of the Cabinet at once saw their difficulty. They realised that it would never do to buy from a Duke cheaply and then represent that you had made a very good bargain by charging enhanced rents afterwards. It was pointed out to the noble Earl that if this transaction was to be carried out on behalf of the Government he really would have to show a substantial profit; and if, as I say, it was to come out that you had bought very cheaply from a Duke and yet had to extract more money from the tenants it would "give the whole show away" as far as the ducal question was concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03917">The noble Earl, to do him credit, showed himself quite equal to the task, and I confess I am rather surprised myself because I have always considered my noble friend opposite as distinctly the most ingenuous and the most unsophisticated member of the Government, and I always welcome his interpositions into the vitiated atmosphere of politics just as I welcome a breath of fresh air or the aroma of new-mown hay. It only shows how mistaken one can be in appearances. My noble friend has
<col>1396</col>
turned out to be a sort of political Janus. He presents to us the appearance of a sort of bucolic philanthropist, but behind this smiling front we have now detected the appearance of the artful and designing wire-puller and politician. Not only did the noble Earl succeed, with great ingenuity, in getting these tenants to say that they wanted their rents raised&#x2014;a very clever thing in itself&#x2014;but he hit upon the brilliant, almost I may say the Napoleonic, idea of asking the Duke of Bedford to raise the rents himself before parting with his property, so that presumably my innocent and magnanimous friend the Duke of Bedford would suffer from the odium attaching to that proceeding while the President of the Board of Agriculture would enjoy such credit and glory as arose out of the transaction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03918">That was a very remarkable feat on the part of the noble Earl opposite. But what is more amazing to me than anything in the history of this transaction is that the Duke of Bedford actually agreed to this proposal. I really on the spur of the moment find it almost impossible to think of any act of self-denial in history comparable to the action of my noble friend, who I regret is not present this evening. He reminds me of the Swiss patriot who, when the fighting was going against his own side, collected the spears of his enemy and plunged them into his own bosom in order that his friends might escape. The noble Duke has done better than this. He has diverted on his own head all the thunder and fury of Radical opposition, and has turned himself into a scapegoat for his class. I confess that such an act of self-abnegation is altogether beyond my intellect and understanding. If I had been asked to perform an operation of this kind I should have refused without the slightest hesitation. In justice to the much-abused class to which the noble Duke belongs, I hope that when they are arraigned before the bar of public opinion it will be counted for righteousness on their side that there was at all events one man among them who was willing to practise Christian virtues to the fullest extent. What I wish to know is whether it is the case that the noble Earl opposite actually invited the noble Duke to place himself in this extraordinary position in order literally to save the face of the Government. I should be obliged if the noble Earl would at the same time explain what particular virtue there can be in land
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0705"/>
<col>1397</col>
nationalisation, recommended by certain members of the Government, when it must be perfectly apparent to anyone who has considered these transactions and correspondence that it is much more economical to be the tenant of a Duke than the tenant of the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03919"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will try, as briefly as I can, to give an account of what really happened in the case of this estate; but I hope I shall be excused from going into the question of land nationalisation, which was so well dealt with last night by my noble friend, Lord Crewe. During last autumn I heard that the Thorney estate was to be sold, and I therefore approached the Duke of Bedford on the subject. On October 31, 1908, the Duke wrote me to say that he had determined to offer the Thorney estate by public auction in the summer of 1909, but that he would prefer to sell it to the Government. On February 16 of this year I had an interview with the Duke on this subject. On February 17 the <i>Evening Standard</i> announced the price at which the Duke was willing to sell to the Crown, and it was copied from the <i>Evening Standard</i> into other papers in the course of the next few days. But it was not until February 23 that the price asked was communicated to me by the Duke's agent, Mr. Prothero, and that was done confidentially.<lb/>
The offer I received then would have necessitated the raising of the rents by fifty per cent. if the Crown were to obtain a fair return on their purchase. I was therefore unable to give the price asked by the Duke, and I declined his offer. Early in February the Duke gave notice to quit to all his tenants in view of the sale. On February 25 a deputation of the Duke's tenants waited on me and implored me to buy the estate for the Crown, and they pledged themselves voluntarily to pay the rent that was fixed by an independent valuer. That petition was signed by seventy tenants. I do not want to exaggerate or overstate anything, but the state of mind of those tenants was, to say the least of it, a state of very considerable anxiety. I was anxious to do what I could to meet their wishes, and my object in desiring to purchase was to a great extent to keep the tenants on the land. If the land had been sold in the open market it might have been bought by speculators
<col>1398</col>
or anybody else, whose only object naturally would have been to make money out of the tenants. If the Crown purchased it was necessary to secure a reasonable return on the money, and, as the existing rents were notoriously low, some increase of rent was inevitable, whether the Crown or any other purchaser bought the property.<lb/>
In negotiating for the purchase valuations were made on behalf of the Crown and of the Duke. The Duke's advisers proposed an increase of forty-six per cent. of the rents, and based their valuation on that rental, but the Crown's advisers considered the proposed increase was too large, and they based their valuation on an increase of thirty-five per cent., and it was this difference which caused the failure of the negotiations between the Crown and the Duke with regard to the estate. The proposal that the Duke himself should raise the rents before the sale, to which, I understand, great objection has been taken, was made in order that the Crown might buy on an existing rental that represented the fair value of the land. The increase I proposed was less than the increase recommended by the Duke. My proposal, therefore, was obviously to the advantage of the tenants, and, as your Lordships have seen, they were perfectly satisfied to pay that increase. But since this question, much to my regret, has been threshed out in public, although my negotiations failed, I think I may fairly say that they had the effect of causing the Duke of Bedford to abandon his first proposal to sell by public auction, and, as a majority of the tenants have now purchased their holdings, my object, to some extent, has been achieved. The only reason I had for referring to the matter at all during the recent Budget debate was to show by a concrete instance that agricultural property, so far from being damaged by the Budget, has actually very largely appreciated in value, and that it finds now a ready sale at excellent prices. That is the answer to that part of the question.<lb/>
Will your Lordships bear with me while I refer to alleged inaccuracies in the speech I made on the Budget debate? Mr. Prothero writes a letter to the paper in which he says that Lord Carrington made four statements and that&#x2014;
<quote>"Not one of these statements conveys a correct impression of the facts."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0706"/>
<col>1399</col>
What are these statements? "The acreage of the estate is 20,006 acres." I stated in the House that the acreage was 23,000 acres, but I have, I think, some excuse for that statement, because in the Duke of Bedford's book it is put down as 22,845 acres, and these are the figures that I quoted. The whole mistake about that is, I believe, that there is an outlying portion of that estate which is sometimes called the Thorney estate and sometimes the Thorney and Wansford estate. Then Mr. Prothero says that&#x2014;
<quote>"The rental in 1905, as stated in the book from which Lord Carrington professed to quote, was &#x00A3;22,195."</quote>
On page 74 of the Duke's book the rental of that year is given as &#x00A3;22,195 and the expenditure as &#x00A3;22,636, and the difference between the figures happens to be &#x00A3;441, so, may I respectfully ask, where does that authoritative answer come in? The next statement he makes is that&#x2014;
<quote>"Lord Carrington made no bid for the estate, but only for a portion of it."</quote>
I may not have made a bid, but I made an offer originally for the whole of the estate on the basis of the then rents. When I discovered the value the Duke had put on the estate I found that the money belonging to the Office of Woods and Forests Would not cover the whole, and therefore I had to bid for a part of the estate, as it would have been impossible for the Government to borrow money for the purchase of an estate. Lastly, Mr. Prothero says the estimate of the sum for which the property has been sold is inaccurate. We have been told that the estate was sold for three-quarters of a million. Mr. Prothero does not tell us now what the price really is. Had it been less, I think I should have heard of it before now, and if it is more that only strengthens my argument.<lb/>
I made two statements, neither of which, I understand, Mr. Prothero cavils at or questions. I said that in 1897 the Duke of Bedford wrote a book to prove that his Thorney estate, among others, yielded no profit, did not pay its way, and was a source of perpetual expense; that the estate was practically unsaleable and <i>per se</i> insolvent in point of income and expenditure. Those are not my words. They are the words of the noble owner of the estate, and that was the way he described his estate in 1897. I went on to say that in this year, at a time when it was being said that in
<col>1400</col>
consequence of the vindictive Budget no person can venture to invest in home securities, his Grace sold this unsaleable and insolvent estate for three-quarters of a million. There is no attack upon anybody. That is a simple and absolute fact which Mr. Prothero himself does not attempt to deny. I have had the honour of being a member of your Lordships' House for forty-one years, and I do not think there are many in this House who would wish to impute to me the intention in any sort or kind of way to hold up so good a landlord as I truthfully and publicly declare the Duke of Bedford to be as a money-grabber, as I have been accused in Mr. Prothero's letter of doing, or to make him the scapegoat of a Radical Government&#x2014;as was represented in the letter to which the noble Lord has called attention and which has been much commented on by the Tory Press.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03920"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the debate in your Lordships' House on the Finance Bill I followed the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, who in his speech made a reference to this estate, but, of course, I had not the opportunity, in the interval between the noble Earl sitting down and the remarks which I addressed to your Lordships, to obtain any information as to the correctness, or perhaps I ought to say the justice, of the remarks of the noble Earl. But those who are the representatives of the Duke of Bedford have now made public what are the true facts of the case in connection with this Thorney estate, and I am very glad to think that the noble Earl does not in any way impugn the veracity of Mr. Prothero. Mr. Prothero stated, and the noble Earl admits that the statement was perfectly correct, that he declined to purchase the estate until the noble Duke had himself raised the rents of his tenants in order that the Government might show a more profitable bargain and might not have thrown upon them the odium of raising the rents themselves.<lb/>
I think anybody who has read the correspondence which has passed on this subject will have seen what was in the mind of the noble Duke from the very beginning. The noble Duke was interested in keeping his tenants on the land. He may have given them notice; it is a customary practice when you are about to sell an estate to give notice to your tenants in order that
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0707"/>
<col>1401</col>
you may give vacant possession at the earliest possible date. The noble Duke had an offer some years ago for this estate, not of &#x00A3;750,000, but of &#x00A3;800,000. Why did he not accept it? He did not take it because he thought it was made by land speculators who would be likely to disturb his tenants. Then the tenants, being between the frying-pan and the fire, preferred the frying-pan of the noble Earl, the President of the Board of Agriculture, and they said that even if they had to pay fifty per cent. more in rent they would be at any rate assured that they would continue as tenants if the Crown became the purchaser of the estate The Crown did not become the purchaser. Who did? The tenants themselves&#x2014;at least five-sixths of them have become the purchasers of their own holdings. The purchase-money, or a large portion of it, has been allowed to remain at interest, and the result is that your Lordships will see established on the Thorney estate the old-fashioned class of what is known as yeoman farmers in this country.<lb/>
What was the whole tone and gist of the speech of the noble Earl. It was to show that under a beneficent Liberal Government the value of the Thorney estate had increased enormously, and that the noble Duke was able to sell it for three-quarters of a million. But he neglected to tell your Lordships that the Thorney estate had cost the Duke of Bedford and his ancestors &#x00A3;1,800,000 and is now sold for &#x00A3;750,000. Had the money spent on this estate been invested in three percent. Consols the Duke of Bedford would have been a much richer man than he is. I do not think that the case which the noble Earl has put before your Lordships is one which will be a great encouragement in the direction of the nationalisation of land. It is proved abundantly that neither the State nor the county councils can afford to buy land and let it to tenants at the same rent that private owners can afford to do. Here you have the Duke of Bedford letting his land for a return of two per cent. and the Government saying that they cannot do it without a return of four per cent.<lb/>
I venture to say that before we are very much older we shall find that the rents that county councils are obliged to charge for small holdings to guard the ratepayers from loss will be a great deal more than the same land could be let by
<col>1402</col>
private landowners in the way that is customary among the members of your Lordships' House and other landowners of the country. I think we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the noble Earl for the instance of the Thorney estate, for I am sure no example could more clearly show that the great landowners of the country, of whom the noble Duke is an ornament, desire to treat their tenants with absolute fairness and equity and do not seek to obtain even an ordinary return for the capital invested. It you are going to put the land in the hands of the State instead of in the hands of private owners, the inevitable result will be that those who cultivate the land will have to pay more for it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0004P0-03943"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> had given notice to move, after "interest" in the Amendment, to "insert" and of his desire that notices should be sent to him at an address specified in the notice." The noble Lord said: I am in a difficulty with regard to this Amendment and the other Amendment standing in my name on the Paper, owing to the late period of the session at which we have arrived and to events which have happened during the last two or three days. I have no doubt whatever that if I could put your Lordships in possession of all the facts which I have at my disposal you would agree that on their merits these Amendments ought to be inserted. I would remind your Lordships of the position of this Bill. It came before this House for Second Reading in August. It was then debated at some length. Certain Amendments which were asked for by the life offices were subsequently agreed to, but a great many Amendments which were considered important were not accepted by His Majesty's Government. A week ago the Commons returned the Bill to your Lordships' House with certain Amendments, and those Amendments were in many cases a reversal of the undertaking given by the President of the Board of Trade to a deputation which waited upon him from the life offices. It may be pleaded, perhaps with reason, that the President of the Board of Trade had no alternative, but the very important interest on whose behalf I speak to-day
<col>1404</col>
have nothing to do with that. They maintain that unless these two Amendments are inserted in the Bill their position will be greatly prejudiced, and they would prefer to lose the Bill than that it should proceed without the Amendments. I have received a telegram to-day from the Life Association of Scotland, which comprises eleven offices domiciled in that country. They repeat what I have already told your Lordships, that unless the Amendments are carried they would far sooner that the Bill was dropped</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03944">And when I mention that on this occasion I speak for thirty-two out of thirty-five life assurance offices&#x2014;twenty-four English and eleven Scottish&#x2014;with a capital of &#x00A3;165,000,000 and an annual income of &#x00A3;20,000,000, you will see that the case I present is not without weight. On going through the books of one of the most prominent life offices it was found that in the case of 200 policies which had been issued no fewer than 235 notices had been lodged. These policies were not picked out, but were taken consecutively as entered in the company's register. In an ordinary life office there are from 10,000 to 15,000 such policies, so you see the enormous amount of work which will be placed, as the clause now stands, upon any company which wishes to amalgamate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03945">My second Amendment is to the new paragraph (<i>g</i>) inserted in Clause 31 by the Commons&#x2014;
<quote>(<i>g</i>) Any business carried on by an assurance company which under the provisions of any Special Act relating to that company is to be treated as life assurance business shall continue to be so treated, and shall not be deemed to be other business or a separate class of assurance business within the meaning of this Act.</quote>
I propose to add, after the words "relating to that company," the words "or under its constitution." There are in London about twenty-two purely life offices, which conduct their business in a certain way legalised by Parliament. An exception to this case is the Norwich Union, which has a private Act of its own. The Board of Trade discovered late in the day that this private Act existed, and they have, by means of this clause, given a special exemption and monopoly to the Norwich Union which they have denied to other companies. I hold that rather than twenty-two companies should be brought into line with one, one company should be brought into line with the other twenty-two; I think
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0709"/>
<col>1405</col>
justice demands that. The insertion of my Amendment would place these companies on the same basis as, and would not in any way prejudice, the Norwich Union. The companies consider these two Amendments to be of first-class importance, and if the Government choose to refuse to accept them the responsibility must rest on their heads. I shall wait with interest to hear what the noble Lord in charge of the Bill has to say; and I now move my first Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03946">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>After ("interest")in line 3 of the Amendment to insert ("and of his desire that notices should be ' sent to him at an address specified in the "notice")&#x2014;(<i>Lord Montagu of Beaulieu.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03947"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has said that this Amendment of the Commons is a reversal of some undertaking which was given by my right hon. friend to the life offices. I cannot admit that. This is a Bill dealing with a highly technical matter, in which a great number of different interests are involved, and the whole history of this Bill has been an endeavour by the Board of Trade to do substantial justice to each of these interests, and at the same time to do justice to the policy-holders in this country. The policy-holders, I need hardly say, must be the object of the utmost solicitude on the part of the Department and they must be the people whose interests must be kept first of all in view.<lb/>
This particular Amendment was discussed in the House of Commons, and it was moved there in substantially the form in which the noble Lord now moves it. But as the result of discussion and in order to meet the objections of other interests, the Amendment was inserted in the form in which it appears in the House of Commons Amendments to this Bill. Now, what is this Commons Amendment? It requires that when amalgamation of two insurance companies takes place certain notices as to the proposed amalgamation or transfer of business shall be given to persons who have registered themselves with the company as being interested in policies. I do not understand that the noble Lord denies that it is absolutely right and proper that those notices should be sent out. Here are people who have lent or invested money or taken out a policy of insurance in certain companies, and if their security or their property is to be altered in any way it is
<col>1406</col>
obviously right that they should receive notice. What the noble Lord proposes in his Amendment is that these notices should only be sent out in cases where the person claiming to be interested in a policy has intimated his desire that notice should be so sent. There is not a very great difference between us so far as future policies are concerned, because it is obvious that if these words were put into the Bill any one sending such a notice would put these words into the notice and the thing would become a common form. But what it really amounts to is that the noble Lord wishes rather to trade upon the fact that a certain number of people who have already sent notices may not take the trouble of any future action in the matter, and by that means they would be deprived of the protection which we think it is right they should be given.<lb/>
The Board of Trade cannot agree with that view, and in consequence I am unable to accept the noble Lord's Amendments. I would point out that owing to the late period of the session at which we have arrived it may be difficult to get any Amendment through another place, and for that reason I was particularly anxious that these Amendments should have been taken earlier. The noble Lord saw fit, when the Commons' Amendments came up the other night, to move that their consideration be adjourned, and that course was adopted. I was not in a position to prevent its being done; but I very much deprecate that a purely departmental Bill of this kind should not have been allowed to go through in the calmer atmosphere which then prevailed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03948"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My sole object in moving the adjournment was to give a further opportunity for compromise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03949"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: I do not think it did facilitate matters; and in view of the late period of the session, and the position of affairs at the present time, it would be difficult to induce the other House to accept Amendments, and, therefore, I hope they will not be insisted upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03950"><member>LORD SANDHURST</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I sympathise a great deal with the noble Lord's first Amendment, for I have no doubt that the requirement as to notice will create a good deal of difficulty in insurance offices.
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0710"/>
<col>1407</col>
should the question of amalgamation come up. At the same time, I cannot think that the point is really so very important as to run the risk of losing the Bill, which I must say has a great deal to recommend it. As to the Norwich Union, I do not quite see how the power conferred upon it by an Act of Parliament could he withdrawn, because no doubt they would have already entered into many contracts. But seeing the period of the session at which we have arrived, I should greatly regret, although I sympathise with the noble Lord in the object he has in view, if any action we took to-night led to the loss of the Bill. In these circumstances I hope the noble Lord will not press the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03951"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: I venture to join with the noble Lord in expressing the hope that nothing will be done to jeopardise the passing of this Bill. I do not think the arguments used by the noble Lord who moved the Amendment tended to show that it was one of first-class importance. The noble Lord, however, did make one remark which I thought seemed to indicate the trend of his mind in regard to the question generally. He told your Lordships that those whom he represented would not be sorry if the Bill did not pass, and if the result of pressing the Amendment would be to destroy the Bill. I must say that is not an object with which I can sympathise. I think it would be rather a calamity if this Bill&#x2014;a departmental, and, to a large extent, non-contentious Bill&#x2014;were to be made use of for that purpose which has commonly been called "filling up the cup."<lb/>
With regard to the second Amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, I am not sure that I am greatly in sympathy with the Commons Amendment as it stands. At the same time the statutory right which the Norwich Union possess is one which they have acquired at some expense to themselves and after going through the null of the two Houses of Parliament, and it scarcely seems right that by a side wind in a general Act you should take away from any person or corporation special privileges which have been granted to them and ratified by an Act of Parliament. For that reason I think your Lordships might very properly allow the exceptional position of the Norwich Union to be recognised. But when you go further than that and propose that a provision shall be inserted which amounts to enabling any existing
<col>1408</col>
insurance company, by simply calling together a meeting of its shareholders and making an alteration in its articles of association, to do that which Parliament has sanctioned in the case of the Norwich Union, then you are taking a step which goes a great deal further than the necessity or justice of the case demands. In view of the lateness of the session and the fact that these Amendments are not of first-class importance, I hope your Lordships will not imperil the passage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03952"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: I did not refer to the noble Lord's second Amendment because I did not understand that it was before the House. I only wish to endorse what fell from the noble Earl who has just sat down, and to say that the position of the Government is substantially the position the noble Earl has taken up. The Amendment regarding the Norwich Union would enable any company which made in its articles of association the alteration suggested, or which had such a clause in its articles of association, to drive a coach and four through the provisions of the Act of 1870, which requires life funds to be kept absolutely distinct from other funds. I therefore oppose that Amendment as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-03953"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will do well not to disregard the advice given to the House by the noble Earl the Lord Chairman. We have arrived at a moment when we have to consider not merely the intrinsic merits of the proposals which are submitted to us. As to those merits, speaking as one who has no pretention to expert knowledge, it seemed to me that Lord Montagu was able to make a strong case. He certainly was able to show the House that he had a considerable amount of backing for his proposal. But the situation is peculiar. We have to consider how we stand with regard to time. It is quite clear, from what the noble Earl who leads the House told us earlier in the evening with regard to another Bill, that to send any measure that comes to us to-day back to the other House of Parliament would be to decree the loss of that measure; and we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the political atmosphere at this moment is not very favourable to compromise. In these circumstances it certainly appears to me that any insistence on the part of the noble Lord upon his Amendment would probably
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0711"/>
<col>1409</col>
be fatal to the Bill. Most of us do not desire that an untoward fate should overtake this Bill, and I would, therefore, counsel him, on those grounds and not on any ground connected with the strength or weakness of his case, not to insist on his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HIS MAJESTY'S SPEECH.</title>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04005">And afterwards His Majesty's most gracious Speech was delivered to both Houses of Parliament by the Lord Chancellor (in pursuance of His Majesty's Command) as followeth:</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04006"><i>"My Lords and Gentlemen,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04007">The official visit which His Majesty the King of Portugal has paid to Me, on the occasion of his accession, has afforded to the Queen and Myself great pleasure, and has consolidated and strengthened the bonds of friendship which have so long and happily united the two allied nations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04008">My relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04009">The difficulties which unfortunately arose in South-Eastern Europe in the autumn of last year have happily resulted in a practical solution and in the maintenance of peace, while the constitutional regime in the Turkish Empire continues to make satisfactory progress.</p>
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0713"/>
<col>1413</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04010">Subject to certain reservations made by My Plenipotentiaries at the time of signature, I have ratified such of the Conventions which resulted from the Peace Conference held at The Hague in 1907 as do not require municipal legislation in this country to give effect to their provisions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04011">Arbitration Conventions and Agreements with Germany, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Portugal have been renewed for a further term of five years. Others, which are about to expire, are in process of renewal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04012">A measure for improving Indian administration by enlarging the numbers and extending the functions of the various Legislative Councils has become law, duly supplemented by the necessary Regulations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04013">Early in the coming year the Councils will have been constituted, and will undertake the burden of their new responsibilities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04014">I look with confidence for their loyal co-operation with My appointed officers in the tasks of Government, thus furthering the moral and material progress of My Indian subjects, and strengthening the foundations of My Empire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04015">I have with the greatest satisfaction, assented to the Act establishing the Union of South Africa, which embodies the united wishes of the Parliaments of the four constituent Colonies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04016">This fruit of the success which has attended the grant of free institutions to My new Colonies is, I am assured, a matter of cordial congratulation throughout My Dominions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04017">I cannot doubt that union will add to the strength of South Africa, and I pray that its people may be blessed in the years to come with growing prosperity and lasting concord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04018">The important Conference which met in July last for the exchange of views between My Government and the Governments of My self-governing Dominions beyond the seas upon the subject of naval and military defence has been of great mutual advantage, and as the outcome of its deliberations it may confidently be expected that the stability of My Dominions will be preserved and their unity promoted.</p>
<col>1414</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04019"><i>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04020">I thank you for the liberality and care with which you provided for the heavy additions to the national expenditure due to the requirements of Imperial defence and social reform.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04021">I regret that that provision has proved unavailing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04022"><i>My Lords and Gentlemen,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04023">An Irish Land Act has been passed which, by relieving local funds from liabilities arising under previous Purchase Acts and by increasing the administrative area and the resources of the Congested Districts Board, will, I sincerely hope, conduce both to the general welfare of the country and to a permanent improvement in the condition of the occupiers of small holdings in the West of Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04024">I have watched with interest the progress of a measure, which has now been placed upon the Statute Book, for facilitating the Housing of the Working Classes and for strengthening the law dealing with the sanitary conditions under which they live.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04025">This measure also contains long-needed provisions for controlling the development of towns with a view to securing not only improved sanitary conditions, but also amenity and convenience.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04026">I have given My assent to a Bill for the establishment of Labour Exchanges, which will, I trust, be an important step towards the better regulation of the Labour Market and a foundation for further measures for dealing effectively with some of the evils of unemployment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04027">The measure which has been passed for the constitution of Trade Boards in certain industries will, I hope, with judicious administration, prove a valuable boon to a specially helpless class of workers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04028">'I anticipate beneficial results to agriculture and to the rural industries of the country from the measure for the economic development of the United Kingdom and for the improvement of roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04029">I have had pleasure in assenting to a Bill to give effect to a Treaty which secures
<image src="S5LV0004P0I0714"/>
<col>1415</col>
the full benefits of the French law of Workmen's Compensation to British workmen injured in the course of their employment in France.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04030">Important Bills have also been passed dealing with Trawling in prohibited areas, the consolidation and amendment of the law relating to Assurance Companies, the suppression of gambling on loss by maritime perils, and the amendment of the Electric Lighting Acts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04031">'I thank you for the zeal with which you have discharged your arduous and protracted labours, and I pray that they may be rewarded by the blessing of Almighty God."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04032">Then a Commission for proroguing the Parliament was read. After which</p>
<col>1416</col>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04033"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> said:</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04034">"MY LORDS, AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04035">By virtue of His Majesty's Commission under the Great Seal, to us and other Lords directed, and now read, we do, in His Majesty's Name, and in obedience to His Commands, prorogue this Parliament to Saturday the Fifteenth day of January One thousand nine hundred and ten, to be then here holden; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to Saturday the Fifteenth day of January One thousand nine hundred and ten."</p>
<p id="S5LV0004P0-04036">End of the Fourth Session of the Twenty-eighth Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in the Ninth Year of the Reign of His Majesty King Edward VII.</p>
