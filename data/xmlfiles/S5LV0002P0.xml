<title>INDIAN MILITARY ADMINISTRATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00194"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> rose to call attention to recent changes in the military administration of the Government of India, to ask for information from His Majesty's Government, and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00195">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I do not think that I need apologise for bringing this subject before the attention of your Lordships. During the last four years great and startling changes have been introduced into the military administration of India. I am not sure that a further change is not now being enacted there which if closely examined will turn out to be the most startling of all. Throughout this period there has only been one discussion on this matter in either House of Parliament, and that was the debate that took place here on August 1, 1905. On that occasion the noble Marquess, Lord Ripon, who I am sorry to see is not, and probably cannot be, present to-day, made a speech&#x2014;masterly in logical argument and compression&#x2014;to which I shall have occasion more than once to refer in my remarks this afternoon. In the course of that speech he complained that these changes had been adopted without the knowledge or advice of Parliament. I think this statement was true at that time, and it holds true, I believe, of the other House of Parliament to this moment. Our debate this afternoon will, I hope, remove the reproach, if reproach it be, from this House of the Legislature.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00196">None of your Lordships will contest the proposition that the military administration of India is a matter of the first and most important concern. It is no more question, as the words might appear to suggest, of organisation or of official or departmental routine; it is a matter that may affect the whole conditions on which you hold and rule India. Your Lordships know perfectly well that in the last resort it is upon our military strength that our position in India depends. At this moment and at any moment the large majority of the English population in that country are soldiers. Military considerations are of supreme importance there, and they are interwoven with civil and political conditions to a degree which is almost unintelligible to any one who is only familiar with the practice of this country. Above all,
<col>12</col>
in India you have the phenomenon of the Native Army&#x2014;that delicate, complex, and difficult machine&#x2014;and you might almost say that the contentment of the Native Army of India is synonymous with the continuance of your rule in that country. I am sure, therefore, that any proposal that may affect the Native Army of India is one that ought to be watched, and scrutinised with the most anxious consideration by this House, and that your Lordships will agree that no great change in military administration ought to be carried out without so far as possible the cognisance and, if it may be, the support of the Parliament of this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00197">Since February, 7906, when the noble Viscount the Secretary of State laid down his policy as regards military administration in India, I have not said or written one word publicly about the matter. I felt that it might be difficult for me to observe a proper detactment in matters in which I had necessarily had a very great concern. During these three and a half years the Secretary of State will admit that his scheme has had a fair trial, and I am sure he will be the last man to complain if now at the end of this period we ask his permission to review the history of these years and take note of the developments on which he is about to embark.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00198">From the reconstitution of the Government of India after the Mutiny until the year 1905 there existed in India a system of military administration which, although from time to time it was modified in unimportant particulars, remained essentially the same. Under that system you had a Commander-in-Chief in India who was an officer of the very highest distinction either in the British or Indian service. He was responsible for the recruitment, organisation, and training in peace of the Indian Army, and for its direction in time of war. He had exclusive control of the <i>personnel</i> of the Army. In addition to that, he was an Extraordinary Member of Council, which means that he was a member of the Government of India, of the Viceroy's Cabinet, with a voice in every aspect and affair of the administration. He was, in fact, the second man in the country to the Viceroy and his foremost adviser on all military affairs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00199">Throughout that period this officer was
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0010"/>
<col>13</col>
primarily, if not entirely, an executive officer, and he had little or nothing to do with those administrative matters, which are ordinarily the business of what is called the War Department in European countries. That business was conducted in the Government of India by a Department known as the Military Department, which acted for the Government of India in its military capacity exactly in the same manner as the Foreign Office in India represents the Government of India for foreign affairs and the Home Department for home affairs. The head of this office was a soldier, for although under the Statute he might be a civilian, in practice he always was a soldier&#x2014;a soldier who was known as the Military Member, and was also a member of the Council of the Governor-General. This officer and his Department were charged with the duty of controlling the great spending military departments of the Government, of preparing the military budget, of preserving the military records of the Government, and more particularly of advising the Governor-General in Council with due regard to continuity of policy and more especially with scrupulous attention to the interests of the Native Army. I think in two or three sentences that is a fairly accurate description of the system of military government prevailing in India for the half-century from the close of the Mutiny until four years ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00200">In the year 1905 the late Government, because of complaints that were made against the working of that machinery, decided to bring it to an end. I do not propose on the present occasion to re-argue the case in this House. I had an opportunity at that time of stating my views in Parliamentary papers which were laid before both Houses, and I need only now remind your Lordships that in those views I was supported by the whole of my colleagues in India, with the single exception of the Commander-in-Chief, and by a public opinion in that country, which was practically unanimous. Those views were further entertained, I believe, by every living ex-Viceroy who had spoken or was consulted on the matter; and nowhere were they expressed with greater force or eloquence than in the speech of the noble Marquess, Lord Ripon, to which I have, referred. So important was that speech considered that it was republished and brought out as a pamphlet by one of the organisations of the
<col>14</col>
party to which noble Lords opposite belong, and had a wide circulation. I really wish that the rules of this House permitted me to read that speech to your Lordships this evening from beginning to end, because, in the first place, I should spare your Lordships the trouble of listening to me, and, in the second place, the Secretary of State, instead of having to listen to the utterances of what perhaps he may regard as a critic on this Bench, would be listening to the arguments of a colleague of his own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00201">Though the late Government decided to put an end to the old system, they were far from accepting the alternative which had been proposed to them from India. That alternative was that the Commander-in-Chief should take over the whole functions of the Military Department and should emerge as the single military adviser of the Government of India&#x2014;supreme in the field, supreme in the Council Chamber, and supreme in the office. This proposal was emphatically condemned by the Committee which was appointed by the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, to advise him at the India Office, and on which sat the noble Earl the Field-Marshal &#x2014;Lord Roberts&#x2014;and Sir George White. It was also rejected in the Secretary of State's Despatch which conveyed his orders to the Government of India; it was equally condemned by the noble Marquess the Leader of this House, who on August 1, 1905, took credit to the Government for their absolute refusal to listen to the proposals submitted to them to destroy the Military Department and Military Member altogether. Accordingly the late Government constructed a compromise. No one knows better than the noble Viscount who has written learnedly upon the philosophy of compromise, that compromise between views which are in essence irreconcilable as a rule gives satisfaction to neither party and often aggravates where it is expected to appease.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00202">Of such a character, I think, was the compromise to which I refer. It was this. The late Government took those functions of the old Military Department which related to military supply and placed them under a separate member called the Military Supply Member, who might be a civilian, but who it was understood would be a soldier. They handed over the remainder of the functions of the old Military Department to the office of the Commander-in-Chief, which they
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0011"/>
<col>15</col>
reconstituted as an Army Department under that officer. At the same time the late Government, in pursuance of their desire to provide the Viceroy and his Council with a second military adviser, tried to convert this Military Supply Member into the type of safeguard which they required. The attempt to combine these two functions appeared to me, and I think to most of us in India, to be absolutely impossible from the start. You could not take an officer of inferior rank, place him in charge of a Department the business of which was narrow and confined and the subordination of which was marked by every possible means&#x2014;an officer who was, in fact, really a purveyor of military supplies and nothing else&#x2014;and expect him to act as an independent adviser either on military, political, or any other matters to the Viceroy. I sought to invest this Department and this officer with real substantiality &#x2014;to make him a capable alternate adviser of the Government. I asked for the services of the most qualified and capable officer that I could find for the purpose. Those requests were refused and I resigned my position as Viceroy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00203">Soon after that the late Government proceeded to fill up the post they had created. When they appointed to this post an officer, an Ordnance officer who, however excellent his qualifications in that confined branch of the service, and they were excellent, might be, was, by the circumstances of his professional career, quite unqualified to act in the position of independent adviser to the Government of India, it was evident that the first conception entertained by the then Government had disappeared, that the appointment had no sufficient justification, and that its duration could only be a matter of short time. There appeared to me to be no reason why you should create a Department of Military Stores alone, and place at the head of that Department an officer whom you then made a Cabinet Minister with a salary of from &#x00A3;5,000 to &#x00A3;6,000 a year, and who was a member of the Government of India for all purposes. In the telegram in which I offered my resignation I spoke of the new Department as being an unpardonable waste of public money, and I said it would be better to dispense with it altogether. That is all I have to say about the history of the past.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00204">Shortly after that the late Government went out of office, and were succeeded by His Majesty's present advisers. I do not believe
<col>16</col>
I shall be doing the noble Viscount an injustice if I say that I believe from the start he was fully aware of the anomalies and that he probably accurately foresaw the impracticability of the post as it was then created. But for reasons of public and political expediency, which were explained by him in his Despatches, he decided to give it a fair trial. I regretted that decision at the time, but I do not regret it now because, instead of the system being abandoned because it was regarded as theoretically unsound or because most people predicted its failure, it has now been abolished only after fair trial and on the very grounds on which I ventured to predict its failure four years ago. The history of these events is recorded in the correspondence laid before both Houses of Parliament. I need only summarise it in one or two sentences. At the first the present Government of India, with the optimism that sometimes characterises Governments when surveying themselves, were very confident as to the excellent working of this machine, in which they said that only certain modifications in detail were required, but the Secretary of State was, if I may say so, not to be taken in by these professions and with most refreshing candour he said so in his Despatch of June 28, 1907, in language almost identical with my own. He said:&#x2014;
<quote>"There appears to me to remain under the new system so little work to be controlled by the Honorable Member in charge of the Military Supply Department that the expediency of maintaining this appointment, or the Secretariat attached to it, or perhaps both, becomes a matter for consideration."</quote>
The Government of India appear to have been somewhat rapidly and conveniently convinced by these arguments, and after a certain further interchange of correspondence the Department was abolished, and the abolition took effect, I believe, on April 1 of the present year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00205">We politicians are apt to indulge from time to time in prophecy, but as political prophets we do not ordinarily excel. I suppose, therefore, I might feel a sort of human and innocent exultation in knowing that my predictions as to this Department have been so faithfully fulfilled. But that is not the view I wish to take, because I think the failure of the experiment was foreseen by everybody, in India at any rate, from the start. It really failed in the first place because there was no need
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0012"/>
<col>17</col>
for a separate Department with this strictly confined area of work presided over by a Cabinet Minister, a member of the Viceroy's Council, and, in the second place, because the head of such a Department could not possibly be an independent or valuable adviser to the Governor-General and his colleagues. So far I have nothing whatever but approbation for what has been done by the Secretary of State in the matter. I think his action in abolishing the Department was right, even if it were inevitable, and I believe it will be endorsed by your Lordships, as it is by public opinion at large.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00206">I come to a more important aspect of the case upon which I desire to speak with all the seriousness as my command. The question for discussion this afternoon is not so much the past as the future; what is the sequel of the changes made, and what is the system now being set up? The system may be seen in skeleton form in the diagram which is printed on the concluding page of the Paper from which I have been quoting. To those who have studied military administration in any country I venture to think this diagram will appear as rather a startling scheme; but to those who are at all familiar with military administration in India it can only excite consternation and dismay. For what is the meaning of this diagram as worked out in practice? You are now going to concentrate in the hands of one man in India&#x2014;I am not speaking of the present Commander-in-Chief but of every future occupant of that post so long as the system remains unchanged&#x2014;you are now going to concentrate in his hands, not merely the executive control of the Army, its patronage, organisation, equipment, inspection, and preparation for war, but all the business of finance and administration which is ordinarily discharged by a War Office; and the officer on whom you are placing these duties is by virtue of his position a Cabinet Minister in India, he has to attend the Executive Council of the Viceroy and the Legislative Council, where he has to introduce and defend his Budget, and he has in a country where government is conducted almost entirely by paper to read all the papers of Government and to give an opinion or vote on every question, be it police, irrigation, land revenue, or anything else. All this work you are going to place on a single man. Such a burden is
<col>18</col>
too much for any shoulders. There is no one in history, except a Napoleon, who could bear such a weight; and eminent as are the Commanders whom we have been fortunate enough to send to India, they do not always belong to the Napoleonic type.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00207">The first remark I have to make upon this new system is that it is opposed to all modern principles with regard to armies. I imagine it to be an accepted principle of military practice that the functions of administration and command are entirely distinct, that they demand different qualities and impose different and sometimes inconsistent duties, and most of all that they never ought to be united in the hands of a single individual. I believe that to be the experience of every modern army. It certainly has been the reasoned and deliberate opinion of every Committee and Commission that has sat in this country during the past twenty years, and there has been no small number, investigating the question of military administration. Many propositions have emanated from different people in this country for the redistribution of military functions or the concentration of military duties in the hands either of the Commander-in-Chief or the War Office, and in every case those proposals have been met with unhesitating condemnation. I might refer to the Report of Lord Hartington's Commission, to the Report of the Welby Commission which sat with special reference to India, to the Report of Lord Esher's Committee on the reorganisation of the War Office, and from all of these Papers I could easily read extracts in confirmation of what I say.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00208">I have here a most interesting Blue-book containing the Report of the Royal Commission that sat on the war in South Africa, and among the Appendices to that Report were two Minutes of a most powerful and convincing character, emanating from the noble Marquess behind me and the noble Viscount sitting next to him, with reference to certain proposals put forward by Lord Wolseley for the greater centralisation of powers in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief in this country. Lord Wolseley was proposing almost exactly the same system in England as is being or has been set up in India; and his plans were rejected by the two noble Lords behind me, and his post was abolished altogether. The same condemnation is to be found in no less degree
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0013"/>
<col>19</col>
in the notable speech delivered in August, 1905, by the noble Marquess, Lord Ripon, in this House to which I have already referred, and I believe it is impossible to quote the name of any considerable Indian administrator, living or dead, who has spoken a word in favour of the system of military concentration which is now being introduced in India.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00209">Let me explain exactly what will happen &#x2014;what does happen under the new system. There has been created now an office of the Army Department in India, upon one side of which the Commander-in-Chief presides as the executive head of the Army, and on the other side the same man presides as Secretary of State for War. As Commander-in-Chief it is his duty to formulate proposals for the administration of the Army and for the defence of India. He then submits them to himself as Secretary of State for War; and having as Secretary of State signified his gracious approval of the proposals which emanated from himself as Commander-in-Chief, he sends them on to the Council. When they get there, as the only Military Member of Council he may represent very properly that, in his view, they are indispensable for the prosperity of the Army or the safety of India. He then votes for the proposals which he has thus submitted; and, finally, when they have been approved by the Council, he issues orders as to their execution. That is no joke, or caricature, or parody of the position that exists in India. It is, I believe, a faithful picture of the system of military administration that you have set up. I venture to say that a Commander-in-Chief, as the sole critic of his own proposals, is without a parallel in military administration, and is wholly inconsistent with any sound theory of military government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00210">So much for the working of the machine. Now observe its consequences. In the first place, are you not placing upon the shoulders of one man a burden which, however capable he may be, no individual can bear? A man in the prime of life and in the fulness of vigour could hardly perform the double task. Suppose you have, as we have sometimes had in the past, and as may occur again, a Commander-in-Chief in India in middle or advanced life, who is indolent or in bad health, then the system must at once and irretrievably break down. Then observe its effect upon the offices of the Government.
<col>20</col>
The noble Viscount the Secretary of State is greatly interested in the question of decentralisation in India. A year or rather more ago he sent out to India a Royal Commission with special instructions to submit to him proposals for the greater decentralisation of the civil government, and at a later date, no doubt, we shall see the changes which he proposes to introduce. But it is really astonishing that, while he is contemplating those changes, he should at the same time acquiesce, if he does acquiesce, in setting up in the military government of India a system of centralisation and concentration of work as onerous and overwhelming in responsibility as that which I have described.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00211">The second consequence is this&#x2014;you definitely deprive the Governor-General in Council of the opportunity of hearing more than one side of a military case. What alternative has the Cabinet of the Viceroy, when it meets to discuss some military proposal which, having passed through all the previous stages, comes before it with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Commander-in-Chief, but to accept that proposal, unless it accepts the infinitely greater responsibility of rejecting the advice of the Commander-in-Chief? I alluded at the beginning of my remarks to the Native Army of India. It is in questions connected with the Native Army that the main anxiety lies. You may send out to India your most brilliant commander, trained in all the experience of European armies and wars in every part of the world, but it does not necessarily follow that he has any experience of Indian warfare or any knowledge of the conditions, customs, and even the prejudices of the Native Army. It is conceivable that he may put forward, in all <i>bona fides</i>, proposals which, if carried out, may have disastrous consequences in connection with that Army. Such proposals were put forward in my day. Under the old system there was always an independent Department and a competent military adviser to point out those considerations to the Government and to save them from mistakes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00212">Under the new system those safeguards have disappeared, and although you might rub along in ordinary times, it appears to me that if, in the turn of fortune, you have a Commander-in-Chief ignorant of the Indian Army and at the same time obstinate and headstrong, or one who, without being
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0014"/>
<col>21</col>
ignorant, is at the same time weak and unable to stand up for the interests of the Indian Army, you might in either case have a situation arise which would be fruitful of mischief for the future. The third and perhaps the most important consequence is that the more you pile administrative and official duties upon your Army Member in India the more difficult you make it for him to discharge his duties as Commander-in-Chief. I see present the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, who, I believe, is going to take part in this discussion. He may find it difficult to describe what is the ideal conception of a Commander-in-Chief in India, for the reason that that conception was realised in his own person in that country. I have often heard of his work there, and I have had the honour of serving with three other Commanders-in-Chief, so that I am tolerably familiar with the obligations and work of the officer holding that exalted position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00213">May I say frankly and openly that I am entirely in favour of the old theory of the Commander-in-Chief in India? By the old theory I mean that of an officer who spends at any rate a large part of his time in travelling over the vast areas under his command, in becoming acquainted with his generals, knowing his staff officers, inspecting the regiments, seeing the cantonments, attending the man&#x0153;uvres, and, above all, being seen by and learning the feelings of the native troops. The Native Army in India has been made for the most part by the personal efforts of British commanders; they love to see the Commander-in-Chief. The native officers like to be treated by the Commander-in-Chief as they were treated by Lord Roberts in his day. No administration at Simla, however perfectly organised and efficient it may be, can ever win the same place in their regard. It will be impersonal, a matter of paper and ink discharged from a distance. Nothing has been done or ever will be done in the East except by personality. It is persons who rule, and persons who shape the future; persons who win the affection of the Oriental; and if that is true anywhere it is above all true in the case of the native soldiers of India.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00214">Believe me, and I cannot exaggerate the earnestness with which I utter these words, in the troublous times which lie before us in India&#x2014;and troublous times do lie before us
<col>22</col>
&#x2014;when attempts will be made&#x2014;they have already been made&#x2014;to tamper with the loyalty of your Native Army, it will not be-by any central organisation at Simla, however elaborate and however perfect; it will be only by the personal influence of your commanders, from the highest to the lowest, that your position in India will remain secure. But if the Commander-in-Chief is tied to his office stool at Simla, if he has to spend the greater part of his year at Simla or Calcutta, he cannot possibly do his duty as Commander-in-Chief according to my conception. The real consequence of this system, unless modified, will be that in a few years time you will disestablish the. Commander-in-Chief in India, and the Commander-in-Chief will scarcely continue to exist. Of the two duties which I have described no man can discharge both with equal fidelity. If he is a great administrator his inclination will be to neglect inspection duties. If, on the other hand, he has a strong conception of his executive duties he will spend his time travelling about that vast continent, and then only one result can ensue&#x2014;that is, complete congestion of business and administrative chaos in the office which he has deserted at headquarters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00215">So far I have ventured to discuss the workings of this organisation in time of peace; but I should like before I conclude to ask your Lordships to contemplate for a few moments the much more serious contingency of what is likely to happen in the event of war. Lord Ripon, in the speech to which I have referred, said&#x2014;
<quote>"In the event of war an able Commander-in-Chief would wish to take the field and ought to take the field. I think if he does take command all the arrangements which you are now setting up will immediately break to pieces."</quote>
If that was true when the <i>simulacrum</i> of a separate Military Adviser to the Government still existed in the shape of the Military Supply Member, how much more true is it when even that safeguard has disappeared? Let us suppose the Commander-in-Chief takes the field in the event of a war, say with Russia, in Afghanistan He takes the field with his nine divisions, or as many as can be mobilised for the purpose. What will be left? At Simla or Calcutta there will be a Department without a head, there will be a War Office without a Secretary of State for War, there will be a skeleton of a staff with nothing but the Secretary to the Army Department at its head.</p>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0015"/>
<col>23</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00216">But then you may say that other Generals will come up from other parts of the country to take his place. It must be remembered, however, that, under the new system, the old Presidency Armies have been destroyed. At the present moment the whole of the forces of India are divided into two great armies, the Northern Army and the Southern Army, under two generals, the range of one of whom extends from Aden on the West to the extreme boundaries of Burma on the East. But those Generals are mere inspectors. They have no administrative powers, they have no staff, they have no training either for the conduct or the management of war. There remain nine divisional Generals, who, in the event of a campaign, will naturally accompany their divisions to the front. Therefore, you arrive at this position, that while it is for war that all these great changes have been made in India, with the immense expense that they have caused, it is in the emergency of war that they are almost certain to break down. Of course, you may say that the Commander-in-Chief will remain at headquarters, and will not go into the field. I know some Commanders-in-Chief who would have been by no means willing to accept that situation, and is it not really almost a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> that you should appoint a Commander-in-Chief in India and that the first condition of his appointment should be that he will never take the command for which he has been chosen?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00217">Now, my Lords, it is very risky to propose alternative solutions, and nobody who is without knowledge, without responsibility, and in opposition, can legitimately be called upon to say, however severely he may criticise a system, what he would set up in its place. There is, however, one suggestion which must, I think, have occurred to many of your Lordships during the time that you have allowed me to address you. It is the suggestion that you should keep the Commander-in-Chief but turn him out of the Council. I have no doubt myself, calmly looking back on the history of recent years, and reviewing the probable sources of the mischief, if mischief there was, under the old system, that it originated almost entirely from the fact that the Commander-in-Chief is a member of the Council of the Viceroy, and, therefore, with access to all the papers, saw the notes in which his proposals had been for the necessities of departmental
<col>24</col>
work dissected and analysed and sometimes criticised by officers of inferior rank. I have no doubt that was at the bottom of it. A Lieutenant-Governor, who is in a corresponding position of great importance in the Civil Administration, at the head of a local Government, sends up his proposals to the Government of India. They are equally analysed and examined, and even criticised by departmental secretaries, but he does not see the notes, and, accordingly he accepts the decision of the Government of India as that of the Governor-General in Council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00218">If that be true, it would appear to be the obvious remedy to keep your Commander-in-Chief, but to relieve him from these responsibilities, with all their attendant drawbacks. And that, as your Lordships may know, is the proposal that was made by Sir John Lawrence, when he was Viceroy, and that was approved by Sir Ashley Eden's Committee in 1879 and by Sir Donald Stewart, who was himself a great Commander-in-Chief in India. Theoretically, this solution seems to me to be right, and the change is one that must have been contemplated by the framers of the statute, because, when they made the Commander-in-Chief an Extraordinary Member, they clearly implied a certain discretion to the Secretary of State in putting him on, or not putting him on, that body. And yet, at the same time, I do not think there is one of us in this House, and there are several, who has had official connection with the Government of India who would not greatly regret the disappearance of the Commander-in-Chief from the Council of the Viceroy. I have always felt that so strongly that I argued against it at some length in the Minute which was submitted to Parliament. It has always seemed to me, first, that the Commander-in-Chief is so important a person in India that he ought to be a member of the Government; and, secondly, from my own experience&#x2014;and nowhere did this experience apply more fully than in the case of Lord Kitchener&#x2014;that his authority and experience, very likely derived from a wide area of previous service in other parts of the world, is of enormous value to the Government of India, many of the members of which have quite a restricted range of experience and information. I have, therefore, always been in favour of the Commander-in-Chief remaining a member of the Council. But,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0016"/>
<col>25</col>
at the same time, if the Secretary of State tells us that the present system is going to continue, or if I felt myself that it was going to continue unaltered, I would change those views. I would sooner have a Commander-in-Chief who could discharge the great duties of his office at the expense of turning him out of the Council than I would have one who, because he was constantly required at headquarters, was obliged to neglect his duties as Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00219">There is another solution which may, perhaps, have suggested itself to some noble Lords. It is one which I have heard discussed. It is that you should make your new Army Member the really important man in the Army of India; that he should be responsible for the entire Army, should, in fact, be what would be described as the War Minister in European countries; that you should continue to keep the Commander-in-Chief, with a seat in the Council, but that he should remain second in military prestige and in military rank, the understanding being that, as Commander-in-Chief, it was his main duty to carry out the inspectional business of his office and that he would be absent frequently and at long intervals from headquarters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00220"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: The Commander-in-Chief is the Army Member of the Council. Is the suggestion that he should be kept in that capacity or not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00221"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I would keep the Army Member, but I would dissociate the Army Member from the Commander-in-Chief. Under this suggesttion the real head of the Army would be the Army Member, invested with all the administrative authority which has been conferred on that officer, but from that office I would detach the whole of the executive functions appertaining to the Commander-in-Chief, who would be an officer still retaining his seat as an Extraordinary Member of the Council, but inferior in position and in rank to the Army Member, and therefore incapable of developing in relation to him the friction which is said to have been occasioned in the past. This is not my suggestion; it is one which I have heard discussed.<lb/>
It is not for me to examine or to suggest
<col>26</col>
solutions to your Lordships. The only thing about which I am absolutely confident&#x2014;and here I would predict just as sanguinely as I did about the Military Supply Department four years ago&#x2014;is that the present system cannot last. I assure your Lordships that I do not criticise it because it has broken down in practice, since, as your Lordships know, it has only just now been set up. Neither do I criticise it on the ground that it is going to break down in practice. I criticise it rather because, as I have endeavoured to show, it is incompatible with the principles of sound military administration; because it deprives the Government of India of the opportunity of hearing any but one high military opinion upon the military matters submitted to it; because although you may muddle along, as our nation is in the habit of doing, in time of peace, no one knows what will happen to your machine in time of war; and because at a time when we ought to regard with the most careful and scrupulous attention anything appertaining to the Native Army and when the slightest mistake in connection with that Army may land you in irreparable disaster in India, you have destroyed the only guarantees that existed for the protection of those interests and have set up nothing in their place. I believe that if this system, as I think, of excessive concentration, of dangerous centralisation, is allowed to continue to exist in the headquarters of the Army in India, a time will come when this country will be called upon to pay a serious price for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00222">Moved, That an humble Address be laid before His Majesty for Papers relating to recent changes in the military administration in the Government of India.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Curzon of Kedleston</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00223"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I make no complaint whatever of the noble Lord for bringing this subject before the attention of the House. I agree with him in all he has said as to the delicacy and the importance of wise dealing with the Native Army. On the last occasion when this House discussed Indian military administration the noble and gallant Earl the Field-Marshal used language which is of the greatest importance for many reasons, and which is in perfect harmony with what the noble Lord has said. Lord Roberts said&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0017"/>
<col>27</col>
<quote>"The Native Army is by far the most difficult and delicate part of the problem with which the Government has to deal&#x2014;</quote>
This was in 1905&#x2014;
<quote>"and unless this is constantly borne in mind I foresee that troubles will as assuredly arise in the future as they have done in the past."</quote>
Those are very pregnant and remarkable words, and, though the point is for the moment parenthetical, I will say one word about it. The last time I had the honour of addressing this House was on political reform. Political reform is not wholly unconnected with this delicate problem&#x2014;the noble Field-Marshal and the noble Lord both agree that it is the most delicate of the problems&#x2014;and it is connected because the Indian Army is recruited from the Indian population, and cannot wholly escape from the influences, the moods, the opinions, and the feelings of those from whom they come. Therefore, and this is the last word on this point, to conciliate by reforms which are not unsound and not perilous the population from which the Indian Army comes must be, in my view&#x2014;and I believe the noble Field-Marshal will not differ from me&#x2014;must be a wise and politic operation.<lb/>
Now I pass to the subjects raised by the noble Lord opposite. I have seen in the public prints that this was to be a very important debate, but I declare I do not know now what is the practical object which the noble Lord had in view. Most of what he said&#x2014;in fact, all of what he said&#x2014;touched matters with which I, at least as Minister, have had no concern. His speech was not a criticism of anything that has been done by His Majesty's present Ministers, but a criticism of the views and action of the Government that preceded us<lb/>
The House well remembers the transactions in the summer of 1905, when a Viceroy, a Prime Minister, and a Commander-in-Chief rode into the lists and startled the country, and created what was undoubtedly, I think, a most unedifying situation in the history of our rule in India. It was no new question. It had been debated by Commissions, by Viceroys, and by men of high mark of all kinds, both civil and military. And I never could see why that question could not have been argued in the summer of 1905 in the same temper in which other difficult questions are argued and settled. There were two
<col>28</col>
protagonists, men of tenacious character, and they plunged into mortal combat, and it was that which created what I venture to repeat was a most unedifying and mischievous situation. We took that over and I declare I do not know to-day what it is that the noble Lord has in view, because I do not think he would come forward for the purposes of bare criticism, and I do not know why this dead horse should be flogged again. It is a kind of triangular controversy. The noble Lord quarrels with Lord Midleton over the abolition of the old Military Department. The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, I daresay, will quarrel with me for abolishing the Department of Military Supply. I shall simply tell my own plain tale, and explain the policy which has guided us in the changes we have made.<lb/>
We found in existence, established by Lord Midleton, the principle of a change in the military government of India. A Department of Military Supply was set up, but I think it was well understood at the time that it was a provisional and tentative proposal, and that, as the noble Lord has just said, it was a compromise. The noble Marquess who leads the Opposition said&#x2014;
<quote>"This arrangement may possibly not be perfect. There is no finality in these things. The moment may come when it may be necessary to reconsider some of these details."</quote>
His Majesty's present Government then took office. They found a Viceroy working out the ideas which the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, had submitted. The Government of India wrote me a Despatch conveying the progress that their work was making. I may dwell upon this a little in order to show that I have not been restless, that I have not been moved by any desire for change. Our position was expressed in a Despatch in the year 1906, and I do hope the House will think that I was prudent in not at once reopening the settlement, especially after all the painful circumstances which had attended that transaction. What I wrote in my Despatch to the Government of India was this&#x2014;
<quote>"This compromise among conflicting opinions as to the best way of meeting an admitted desirableness of some improvement and readjustment in the position of the Military Department, His Majesty's Government do not think it wise to re-open, nor by a stroke of the pen to dismiss, at the risk of an indefinite prolongation of fruitless and injurious controversy."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0018"/>
<col>29</col>
The next step was that the Government of India submitted to me a Despatch in which they described the working of the scheme of Lord Midleton as excellent. The prophecies of the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, as to the breakdown of the Supply Department were not immediately fulfilled and in some senses they were not fulfilled at all. I wrote to the Viceroy&#x2014;
<quote>"I have read with pleasure the excellent results so far achieved by the harmonious co-operation of all concerned in fulfilling the intentions and in justifying the anticipations of His Majesty's Government. Friction appears to have sensibly decreased, and for this, praise is due to all who have taken part in the development of the new system. I agree with Your Excellency, however, in recognising that it may be found necessary to make modifications of the system with the view of simplifying its organisation and reducing its cost."</quote>
The Government of India replied&#x2014;
<quote>"After giving this question our fullest consideration we are agreed in respectfully but strongly deprecating there-opening of the question of Military Administration in India at the present time, and only some eighteen months after the introduction of the new system, when if the proposed change should be accepted, we cannot but apprehend a recrudescence of heated and acrimonious public discussion which in the interests of the Army and the Government of India generally it is most desirable to avoid."</quote>
When I received that as an argument I was not impressed by the strength of it, and I thought it showed a want of faith in the public spirit and tact and good taste of English public men of all camps to suppose that a mere change in the Department would lead to a revival of acrimonious and heated discussion. The speech of the noble Lord this afternoon shows that I was prefectly right, and though we are having a discussion upon this matter it has not been acrimonious and it will not be acrimonious. However, I said we would take another year to observe the working of the rules made for Military Supply. In 1907 the Government of India still deprecated the raising of the question, but they agreed that the abolition of the Military Supply Member was "administratively and economically based on sound arguments," and would "have to be dealt with sooner or later."<lb/>
The noble Lord said that the original protest was unanimous on the part of the Council, and was signed by all its members. He will not fail to observe, I hope, that this Despatch agreeing with me that the proposal to abolish the position was administratively and economically based on sound
<col>30</col>
arguments, was signed by two gentlemen who had signed his own protesting earlier Despatch. The end of it was I put to them certain specific questions as to the working of the Supply Department. They still went on urging me not to press the question forward, but replying to my questions. My argument was a very simple one. I said, "I cannot consent to take out of the revenues of India &#x00A3;10,000 a year (which is about the sum involved in the continuance of the Supply Department), because you are afraid that there may be acrimonious discussion at home and in India," and I am sure that the House will agree that that was the only course that the responsible Minister for India could take. If the Supply Department deserved the adverse opinions expressed on it I should have been guilty of great cowardice if I had not said that this saving of Indian revenues and this abolition of a useless and perhaps inconvenient office must take place. That change was made. Lord Midleton may blame what has been done. The Supply Department was his creation. I only beg him to remember that what was done was approved by all who were concerned in the working of it&#x2014;by Lord Kitchener and by General Scott, who was the head of the Military Supply Department; and both these distinguished men are disinterested in their willingness to abandon it, because Lord Kitchener is coming home in a few weeks, and General Scott, of course, loses the post a year before he would otherwise have done. Therefore I press upon the noble Viscount to remember that I was supported in this by all the best and most disinterested opinion that we could find. I cannot think that the House will suppose that I was wrong.<lb/>
Now I pass but very briefly to the controversy raised by the noble Lord, which is a controversy between himself and the noble Viscount who sits near him. His speech more than anything else was a defence of the old system of a Military Department and upon the old lines, too. It was a defence of that system of the Military Department which the noble Viscount abolished, and nearly all his arguments were directed to it. He cited me as agreeing, and so I do, that the Military Supply Department was a mistake. He talked of his predictions and said they had come true. One of his predictions certainly came true, and that a very important one, and that accounts for my desire to give up the Military Supply Department. He had always
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0019"/>
<col>31</col>
predicted that the gentleman who held that post would not find more than two hours work daily. Whether that is literally true or not I do not know, but the gentleman who filled the post is, and was, a man of high character and will certainly do well all work entrusted to him.<lb/>
But the noble Lord made various other predictions which I submit have not proved to be true. He said four years ago&#x2014;
<quote>"There will be a military despotism which will dethrone the Government of India from the constitutional control of the Indian Army, and set up a single commander in its place,"</quote>
and then the noble Lord talked about re-volutionising the Government of India, and used language about Lord Kitchener advocating a system of military autocracy&#x2014;violating the fundamental principles of the constitution&#x2014;and so forth. Well, my Lords, there are many subjects of controversy in politics presenting like features, upon which there have been many sinister apprehensions, many confident predictions, many alarmist anticipations, and the historian looking at these with a friendly smile proceeds to record the complete falsification of all these predictions by the event.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00226"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I had better defer my answer till I have an opportunity to reply later on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00227"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: When the noble Lord does reply, I beg him to point to any evidence that any of the predictions conveyed in his sonorous sentences and phrases have been in any way justified. Will he say whether he thinks that at this moment the Government of India is dethroned from the constitutional control of the Indian Army, that a single commander has taken its place with a system of military autocracy? Before he makes up
<col>32</col>
his mind what to say I will venture to call the evidence of the present Viceroy, Lord Minto. He, addressing his Legislative Council on the point, used these words:&#x2014;
<quote>"Will the new system of the Army Administration ensure for the Government of India the necessary constitutional control over the Commander-in-Chief? I unhesitatingly assert, after the experience of some years of the results of the transfer to the Commander-in-Chief of the power and much of the work of the Military Member, that the change of system, while giving him wider administrative authority, has materially detracted from his independence of action. I can understand the apprehensions of my predecessors as to their want of control over him. The Commander-in-Chief was in many matters free to act on his own initiative; there was no direct channel of communication whatever between him and the Viceroy, there was no Secretary to Government answerable to the Viceroy for a clear explanation of the Commander-in-Chief's views&#x2014;</quote>
I hope the House will note these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The post of Secretary to the Army Department will now always be held by a distinguished General Officer on the same footing as a Secretary of Government in every other Department, fully entitled to differ from the head of the Department and with free access to the Viceroy."</quote>
That was the change dilated upon in my first Despatch in February, 1906, and nobody knows better than the noble Lord what is the importance of the position of a Secretary to the Government of India; he is a General officer of high standing, he has free access to the Viceroy, and all business passes through him on its way to the Viceroy. It is therefore, I submit, a perfect delusion to represent the Viceroy as isolated and the Commander-in-Chief as a military autocrat doing what he likes.<lb/>
There is another personage concerned in the system of Indian government&#x2014;the Secretary of State. There is at present, and I trust it may continue, complete harmony between the Secretary of State and the Government of India, but there were two occasions, two important pieces of policy, on which the Commander-in-Chief took one view and his Majesty's Government here, by the advice of military counsellors in whom they had confidence, took another view. Did Lord Kitchener resist our view? On the contrary, after manfully fighting for his own view, he acquiesced and deferred to our opinion. I have never known a man do so more readily on these two decisions. Therefore all this talk about military autocracy is completely wide of the mark. I can imagine that, if there were a strangely
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0020"/>
<col>33</col>
weak set of men at Simla or Whitehall and a very powerful Commander-in-Chief, the latter might be able to bully and defy the Secretary of State and the Government, but I do not believe that the noble Lord will ever witness such a phenomenon. Much of the noble Lord's argument was on the assumption that the Commander-in-Chief, being of a masterful character, will really be an autocrat; perhaps he will explain how he holds that.<lb/>
There are one or two other points I have to deal with. It has been argued that you are going to impose on the Commander-in-Chief a burden too heavy for the shoulders of any man to bear. The noble Marquess used exactly the same language in this House four years ago. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not know if there are any human shoulders broad enough to bear the double strain of Army administration and Army command."</quote>
As I was listening to the noble Lord I could not help wondering when he described the weight of the burden&#x2014;and it is not a light one&#x2014;whether it could not equally be shown, if set out on paper, that the weight, the responsibilities of a Minister of State are such that no man can bear them. He quoted the language of the India Act&#x2014;
<quote>"The superintendence, direction, and control of the whole civil and military government shall be and is vested in the Governor-General in Council,"</quote>
and so the words stand on paper, and looked at literally and in their skeleton form they describe a burden impossible to be borne. But all Ministers have heavy duties to perform and discharge them as best they can, and so will the Commander-in-Chief. The noble Lord will remember in "Rasselas" the description of the qualifications for a poet and the reply&#x2014;
<quote>"Enough, you have convinced me that no man can be a poet."</quote>
So it might be said of the responsibilities and duties of many offices, including that of the Governor of the Bank of England. Of course, the answer is the obvious policy of delegation of duties, and Lord Kitchener has wisely and prudently carried this policy to an extent to which it has never been carried before. He has delegated many duties to divisional commands that were previously centralised in Simla or Calcutta. The cases are numerous. I will not detain the House by going over them.
<col>34</col>
It is, then, a complete delusion to say that the Commander-in-Chief cannot do what he is required to do. The ditties of the Supply Department, I am assured by those well qualified to speak on the subject, include many to which he has always had to pay attention. On the point of excessive work I would venture to point out that the measure of a man's responsibility is not the measure of a man's work. It should be borne in mind that much depends on the arrangement of business and organisation, on decentralisation, on delegation of authority, and on devolution of business.<lb/>
Now a word about the position of the Commander-in-Chief in war. The noble Lord did not tell your Lordships that no Commander-in-Chief, at any rate so far as I know, has taken the field since the year 1857. The noble Lord's picture of the denudation of the Viceroy was rather overdrawn, for there would be left behind the Adjutant-General with most of his division and also the staff of the Quarter-master-General. The Viceroy would not, therefore, be completely denuded, and there would be no break at all in the continuity of information; and if the Home Government sent out, as they might, an acting Commander-in-Chief, in the event of the Commander-in-Chief taking the field, there would be still less danger of the Viceroy being left in the dark. The noble Lord had rather peculiar views at one moment. As I understand, he entertained the idea of the Viceroy himself directing a campaign. That certainly surprised me very much. I do not believe any other Viceroy would have suggested that he should conduct a campaign.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"In war it is the Government and its head in particular, even more than the Commander-in-Chief, who would be held responsible for success or failure; and no deference to military advice could exonerate the remainder of the Government if they accepted a scheme with their eyes open which they conscientiously believed would break down in the hour of trial. I cannot conceive that
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0021"/>

any Viceroy would consent to conduct a great campaign against a European foe with the machinery that is offered him by Lord Kitchener.&#x2026;.Speaking for myself, I would respectfully ask to be excused from accepting any such responsibility."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00232"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: When I talked about conducting a campaign from headquarters, I meant it in exactly the same way as the Prime Minister would do it in this country. Really, to take my words and distort them into the meaning that I contemplated the Viceroy taking the field in person is too ridiculous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00233"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Well, I will leave that, and will pass to the question of finance. If the noble Lord wishes to know the views of the Government of India concerning the success of the arrangements for controlling finance, he will find them fully stated by the Viceroy in his speech to the Council in March last, and also by Lord Kitchener in his speech on the same occasion. I can only assure your Lordships that military finance has never been under the unrestricted control of the Commander-in-Chief, and I do not believe that any Commander-in-Chief has had less free and unfettered control than Lord Kitchener has had.<lb/>
Lord Kitchener well deserves the compliments which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal paid him in a debate in 1905. Lord Roberts then said&#x2014;
<quote>"I hope that the great soldier at present at the head of the Army in India, to whose hearty co-operation during the war in South Africa I myself was so deeply indebted, accepting the decision of the Government, will feel that the right course has been adopted."</quote>
I am glad to say there never was a Commander-in-Chief who has more loyally and willingly acquiesced in all that devolved upon him to do, even when he was in disagreement with our view. In three or four weeks Lord Kitchener is leaving his post, a post in which he has shown powers of military administration, military knowledge, and military skill that have never been surpassed&#x2014;[turning to Earl Roberts] I say surpassed&#x2014;by any preceding Commander-in-Chief in India. We all, the Government and the country generally, owe him our gratitude for his services. He makes a remark in one of his Papers which is well worth the attention of the House, and which justifies the time given to this debate. He says that Indian
<col>36</col>
administration is much more than a merely Indian question. And so it is. He says also that Indian military administration and organisation are the key of some of the most serious difficulties we have in our own domestic military policy. I hope, therefore, that in considering the changes made by the noble Viscount opposite and then by ourselves the House will feel that we have to keep in view all the time the wise reorganisation and perfecting of the military system of India, because we know how with that is bound up the solution of some of our own military problems, and what tremendous difficulties would fall upon this country if any mistake were made either in organisation or reform by the Army and its leaders in India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00234"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to take part in this debate, but my words will be few. The noble Viscount has quoted from my speech in 1905. I can only say that I never shall forget the heartiness of the support given to me in South Africa by Lord Kitchener, and that I have watched his career in India with delight. At the same time I cannot help expressing my regret that the noble Viscount has thought it necessary finally to do away with the Military Member of Council and thus leave the Commander-in-Chief the only military representative on that Council. I will not express any opinion as to whether the duties latterly entrusted to the Military Member were sufficiently onerous or not to warrant his being specially retained to superintend the Department of Military Supply. Lord Curzon has gone fully into that matter, and I will only express my concurrence with him as to the impossibility of any one man carrying out in a manner satisfactory either to himself or the State the enormous amount of work that must henceforth devolve on the Commander-in-Chief.<lb/>
The diagram of the organisation of the Army administration in India as it exists now that the Military Supply Department has been transferred to Army Headquarters shows what a multiplication of offices and what a variety of duties are concentrated under the sole control of the Commander-in-Chief. In addition to being the head of the Army in a military sense, he is now the head in a Civil sense; in fact, he is Commander-in-Chief and Secretary of State for War rolled into one I observe from the published correspondence
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0022"/>
<col>37</col>
that the proposal to take this step did not emanate from the Government of India, but from the Secretary of State for India. The Government of India apparently deprecated any change being made for the present, for the same reason, I imagine, that makes me feel the undesirability of placing such a heavy responsibility and such an enormous amount of work on the shoulders of any one man, however competent he may be. I found the work of Commander-in-Chief in India heavy enough, and in my time the Madras and Bombay Presidencies each had its own Commander-in-Chief. These appointments have since been done away with, a measure which must add considerably to the duties of the Commander-in-Chief in India, more especially because the General Officer who has taken the places of these officers and now commands the whole of Southern India is not in the same position as the Commanders-in-Chief were, and has nothing like the same authority or the same responsibility that they had.<lb/>
When the subject of Indian military administration was discussed by the Committee of which I was a member in 1905 I agreed that it was desirable to make some change in the respective duties of the Commander-in-Chief and what was then the Military Member of the Council, but I strongly opposed the abolition of the Military Member for the reasons I have just stated. The first duty of the Commander-in-Chief in India is to become acquainted and keep in touch with the Native Army all over the country, and in order to do this thoroughly it is necessary for him to spend nearly the whole of the six cold weather months travelling about. How is it possible for a Commander-in-Chief to do this and at the same time to carry on his work in the Viceroy's Council? Either the work must be relegated to a subordinate, who has no responsibility, or the intimate knowledge of the Native Army, which is so essential, must be neglected. This is why I so deeply regret the action taken by the Secretary of State for India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00235"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord in introducing this Motion told your Lordships that he had not for the last three years said anything on this question which would in any way embarrass the noble Viscount opposite. I have to ask your Lordships' indulgence for a few
<col>38</col>
moments because the case put by the noble Lord and the reply of the Secretary of State have both assumed certain facts based on a misunderstanding of the arrangement made four years ago. During the whole period since that arrangement was made not a word has been said in Parliament, and no opportunity, therefore, has been afforded to any one on behalf of the then Government to explain the position which brought us to the solution for which we were responsible. I should not trouble your Lordships with past history but for the fact that this debate would be incomplete if the House were not seised of the very serious considerations which forced the late Government to take action. Perhaps their greatest vindication is in the fact that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State, after the fears which he expressed before he took office, has found it desirable so greatly to extend the action of the late Government as he has done by the transfer of powers to the Commander-in-Chief which your Lordships are asked to discuss to-night.<lb/>
I do not think it will surprise any member of this House when I say that no Government ever undertook the task of dealing with the reform of military administration in India with greater reluctance than the Government of which I had the honour to be a member. For many years successive Governments have been engaged upon the task of reform of the military system in this country. Nearly twenty years have now elapsed since that was first undertaken, and he would be a bold man indeed who would stand up in this House and say that the results which we have even now attained can be regarded with any degree of finality or as being universally accepted by the country. In one respect the situation in India was exceptionally favourable in 1904 for effecting a change. The noble Lord has paid a high tribute to the qualities which Lord Kitchener brought to the performance of the duties of Commander-in-Chief in India. Undoubtedly his experience outside India was almost unique. For fifty years no Commander-in-Chief in India had held the post who had not been, so to speak, born and bred in the military system of India. Lord Kitchener had recently acted as Chief of the Staff, and afterwards Commander-in-Chief, of an army of 250,000 men, and, as I have said, he went to India with an almost unique experience. It would not be right to let it be believed that the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0023"/>
<col>39</col>
system of dual control had been altogether satisfactory up to the time that the question was raised by Lord Kitchener. I fully admit that the system by which a civilian, a member of the Cabinet, controls military affairs side by side with the military heads of the Army is inevitable under our Constitution, but if you substitute for the civilian with all his disadvantages an officer who is to be a sort of rival of the head of the Army, especially if he is junior in rank, I venture to say you must expect considerable difficulties. We heard something from the noble Lord of the difficulty of a man who is subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief and is the second member of Council giving any effective criticism unless he has the power of acting as the Minister in charge of the Army Department.<lb/>
Was there ever such a position as that which we found in 1904? You take the greatest soldier you have and you give him the position of Commander-in-Chief in India&#x2014;a position of which there is no equal in all the armies in the world, because no one else who is not a Sovereign commands an Army, as the Commander-in-Chief in India does, of over 200,000 men. You give him a seat on the Council and hold him up before the whole world as responsible for the efficiency of the Indian Army, but you give him nominally as a colleague and coadjutor, but in reality as controller, a man who is his junior in rank and inferior in military reputation, who is the channel of all his communications with the Viceroy and entitled to argue purely military questions with him on an equality and to convey to him the decisions of the Viceroy's Council, which in nine cases out of ten are not really the decisions of the Viceroy's Council, but the decisions of the Military Member himself. I know the noble Lord will argue, and will argue with absolute right, that the Military Member does not criticise, accept, or refuse the Commander-in-Chief's proposals as an independent military authority, but as the constitutional representative of the Government of India. That is true, but I am not sure that it did very much to salve the feelings of successive Commanders-in-Chief who find proposals to which they attach importance set aside by a junior. I am quite certain that outside there was a strong feeling that the safety of India, the policy of the Army, was intended to be committed to the Commander-in-Chief and not to the man who sat in the Military Member's chair.<lb/>
<col>40</col>
The system had caused friction before Lord Kitchener arrived in India. I will not cite again the oft-repeated words in which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal in 1889 summed up the differences of opinion which arose. I join in every word that was said by Lord Curzon as regards the noble and gallant Earl's position as Commander-in-Chief. With the loyalty and good feeling which he managed to impart Lord Roberts succeeded in carrying on his work in India without any serious collision occurring between the two Departments. But both in the case of Sir George White, who followed him, and of Sir William Lockhart there were moments of considerable tension. There was beyond that a thing which has not been mentioned to-night. In our military affairs promptitude in dealing with matters is one of the most important elements, but the correspondence between the Military Department in India and the Commander-in-Chief, sitting, as I have always understood, in adjacent buildings, was so immense that in the year when I asked for a return of the missives which had passed between these two bodies of officers I found that they numbered between 9,000 and 10,000. Even after a long experience of the War Office in this country, and with the fullest conviction that in old days the War Office and the Treasury here were as badly organised to transact business as could possibly be the case, the Indian system, it seemed to me, was able to give long points in delay and in want of coming to an arrangement on questions which seemed easily capable of adjustment. I have only gone into these points because I am convinced that this question could not have been left alone&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00236"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00237"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to hear that assent from the noble Viscount. It could not have remained where it was. There is another point, as regards the two Members of Council and their advice to the Viceroy. I do not wish to labour this question, but I think it right to say that that was the cardinal point of difference between the late Government and Lord Curzon. I mean the question whether there should be two men to give opposition advice on purely military questions. No one questions the right of the Viceroy to consult any officer he pleases on any subject, but to put two men in Council
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0024"/>
<col>41</col>
who on technical expert questions could give opinions against each other after you had selected one of them as Commander-in-Chief for his special qualities seemed to create a great difficulty. I know I shall be asked how it was that successive Viceroys approved of the transaction of business under the conditions which prevailed, and how it was that almost all Viceroys regarded the second military opinion as a very valuable asset. I think that that question had grown insensibly far beyond the limits which it was originally intended to reach. The Military Member had by force of circumstances become a far greater man than he was even in the time of Lord Roberts, and it had ended by there being gradually swept into his hands a very much larger amount of business than had been originally anticipated.<lb/>
In regard to the question of duplicated advice, it might be interesting to your Lordships to know that the difficulties which we found in 1904 had been foreseen fifty years before by one than whom no greater administrator ever spent himself in the service of India&#x2014;Lord Dalhousie. In a Memorandum of great force with regard to the Government of India Lord Dalhousie used these words:
<quote>"For military questions the Governor-General has always at his command by law the advice of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the highest authority on such subjects. The presence, therefore, of another Military Member in Council ought to be wholly superfluous in connection with military matters. It not only is superfluous but might become inconvenient, and might be the cause of perplexity to the Governor-General instead of an assistance Since the head of the Army ought to be the most competent adviser on military matters, I think the Commander-in-Chief should occupy his seat and that no second Military Member should be placed in the Council merely in consideration of his reputation or services as a purely military officer."</quote>
I think there is great force in that contention. On the other hand, we were far from desiring to transfer to the Commander-in-Chief a load of business such as he would not be able to perform. As to advice, we felt that the Viceroy could obtain advice from any quarter that he desired.<lb/>
As regards the military autocracy which was feared, the noble Viscount opposite touched upon some of the checks which still exist upon the Commander-in-Chief. I do not think he mentioned all of them. I represented a Government who were as determined as the noble Lord behind me
<col>42</col>
that the position of the Viceroy should be safeguarded to the fullest extent. But look at the course of military affairs under the proposal of the noble Viscount opposite. Supposing the Commander-in-Chief to introduce some proposal which is of great novelty and which might in some way affect the Indian Army. The Commander-in-Chief must bring it before the Mobilisation Committee, on which several military officers as well as civilians sit. The Secretary to the Military Department&#x2014;a Major-General&#x2014;will report upon it, entirely apart from the Commander-in-Chief, to the Viceroy. After the Viceroy's Council have dealt with it it comes over to the India Office, where it runs the gauntlet of another Military Department, also headed by an Indian General, and by a Military Committee, and, finally, of the Secretary of State's Council, on which always one and generally two other Indian Generals sit. My fear would be that this system of checking and counterchecking was still too great for the rapid transaction of business. But in administration we felt that there was ground for a change. Lord Kitchener left us in no doubt as to what his view was.<lb/>
As we made so grave a change, and a change which I propose in a moment to justify, let me read a few sentences of Lord Kitchener's Despatch as showing what his feeling was as to the deadlock in military affairs created by the system which he desired to overthrow. He wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"The dual control here is fatal to efficient government. Our Indian 'administration has been framed mainly to meet peace requirements, and the consideration that an army exists for war has been overlooked."</quote>
He wrote further&#x2014;
<quote>"In war the present system must break down, and unless it is deliberately intended to court disaster, divided authority and divided responsibility must be abolished."</quote>
Those were very serious words. I doubt if any man holding the position of Secretary of State would have been willing to put them aside, especially at a moment when for the first time in our history it had been agreed that the whole British Army, to the number of 120,000, or now 150,000 men, should in case of need be held available for the Indian frontier. With those alarming statements in our minds we had the opportunity in 1904 of considering in some detail with the noble Lord, who was then on leave for a time in this country, what steps might be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0025"/>
<col>43</col>
taken. The question I remember had been discussed with him by the Prime Minister, by Lord Roberts, and by the India Office officials; but so grave was the position that while that question was still being considered here, and while the noble Lord the Viceroy was absent from India, matters reached such a pass at Simla that Lord Kitchener found himself unable to continue the command, and through Lord Ampthill, who was then Viceroy, he desired me to submit to the King his resignation of the office of Commander-in-Chief. He went further. He telegraphed to the Secretary of State for War and desired to submit that he should be placed upon retired pay in order that he should be in the position, as he then would be lacing no longer a combatant officer, to bring the whole of this question before Parliament and the country. I had thought it right to mention how deep-seated was the difficulty in order that your Lordships may appreciate that we did not take up this question in any light spirit, and that being ourselves convinced that there was reason for amendment before Lord Kitchener felt it necessary to take this extreme step, we were the more impelled to see that the machine was made to work smoothly, which I venture to say is more important even than the retention of any person in the command in India.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked why these questions were not settled quietly. I think it was unfortunate that through various circumstances a proposal which I made to the noble Lord at the time was not able to be carried out. I was under the conviction then, as now, that by personal conference with the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief on the spot an arrangement might have been come to which might not have been the exact arrangement to which we ultimately committed ourselves but which would have smoothed over these difficulties and left us a thoroughly effective working system. To that end in January, 1905, after we had written our Despatch to the Government of India and after the noble Lord had resumed his position, I telegraphed to him proposing to send out a Commission of three members who would, I think, have commanded the confidence of every one on either side, no matter what his predilections were in the matter. The three members I proposed were Lord George Hamilton, who had been seven years Secretary of State for India; the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Earl Roberts, who had been seven years
<col>44</col>
Commander-in-Chief; and Sir Arthur Godley, whose experience and knowledge of India Office affairs was probably unrivalled. Circumstances prevented the Government of India concluding their investigations before the hot weather. This made it impossible for the noble Lord, while welcoming the Commission, to accept their arrival before the month of May&#x2014;a time when it is almost impossible to ask men of that age and standing to travel throughout the hot weather both ways and to carry out their investigations in the heat as well. Consequently the matter had to be decided over here; but the result of that decision has had scant justice done to it to-night.<lb/>
In what I have said regarding the working of the Military Department in India let it not be supposed that I wish to cast any slur on the then head of the Department, Sir Edmond Elles; than whom a better or more efficient public servant never did work in India. Nor had we the least intention of substituting for him a <i>simulacrum</i>. We left to the Department an immense amount of routine business. We left them the administration of funds amounting to between &#x00A3;3,000,000 and &#x00A3;6,000,000, the control of manufacturing departments which employ between 15,000 and 20,000 workmen, the management of all the military works, of remounts, of the military marine and the medical department stores; and, on the top of all this, the Military Supply Member was a member of the Mobilisation Committee and also a member of the Council, with all the responsibilities which the noble Lord told us just now attached to the position. I have filled a position something similar to that, without having a Cabinet seat, at the War Office myself. I had exactly the same control of contracts and of manufacturing departments and the rest, and I venture to say that there is no man who could have done that work in this country in two hours a day. I venture to say that if the noble Lord behind me had had charge of that department he would have found that it was an important element in the government of India, and that he was able to exercise very great influence in military affairs as well as relieve the Commander-in-Chief of a great number of duties.<lb/>
It is quite true that we clearly cut a distinction between the work of that Department and the old Department. The new man was to be available for advice to the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0026"/>
<col>45</col>
Viceroy, but he was not to have referred to him all purely military questions in order that his opinion should be set against that of the Commander-in-Chief. He was, as it were, a civilian with military knowledge; he was not a Military Member with military powers. I would ask the House to believe that that decision was come to without the slightest intention of merely finding a way out and salving the feelings of any one, however distinguished. It was come to because we wished to keep a second Military Member in Council, because we wished to prevent the Commander-in-Chief being overloaded, and because we believed that by eliminating one element of which I have spoken we should have accomplished this end.<lb/>
Lord Curzon used the word "failure" with regard to that Department, and said it was one of those compromises which give satisfaction to neither party and aggravate where they are expected to appease. I find no evidence in support of those words in the Correspondence which had been laid before your Lordships' House. On the contrary, every word speaks of the success of this Department. All arrears have been cleared away and all friction has disappeared, and if you want to see what the success has been look at what Lord Kitchener has been able to accomplish in the last five years. When this Department was formed you could mobilise four divisions in India; you can now mobilise nine divisions. Since this Department has been formed the questions of stores, horses, transport, hospitals, and reserves of all descriptions have been dealt with. I do not say that has been due solely to the establishment of this Department, but I will say that the extraordinary rapidity with which the work has been done is an asset in the consideration of this question. Lord Kitchener has steadily added officers to the Indian Army. I wish the same could be said of the Army in this country, where we are short of officers at this moment to a degree of absolute peril. In India they have added to the pay of the men and have added 15,000 men to the Army. And at what cost has that been accomplished? So far as I know, at the cost of a. special vote of &#x00A3;10,000,000 and an addition of &#x00A3;2,000,000 a year to the Estimates. We had a special vote of &#x00A3;10,000,000 in this country, and we have had an addition of &#x00A3;7,000,000 a year to the Estimates. That is maintained by this Government. I will not say we have made no progress. Far from it But I will
<col>46</col>
say that in the last four years, while India has steadily gone on increasing her strength and preparedness, we have bought our increasing efficiency here by the surrender of a large number of our best trained men. I feel that if by the operations of the Government four years ago we have been able to add even a modicum to the success of Lord Kitchener's operations, we have done something as a set off to the unfortunate, and, to my mind, deplorable differences which were aroused at the time to which the noble Lord has alluded.<lb/>
Looking to the future I confess that I view with great regret the further step which the noble Viscount the Secretary of State has taken. I am not going to occupy time by endeavouring to improve in any way, for I could not, upon the account which Lord Curzon has given of the probable overloading of the Commander-in-Chief in India. I realise that in every way it is necessary to keep up the status of the Commander-in-Chief. I think that if there is danger of his being overloaded in time of peace, if there is danger that he will be occupied by his task at Simla when, as the noble and gallant Field-Marshal said, he ought to be carrying on his inspections, the danger is ten times greater in time of war. How are you to get out of this dilemma? You are going, if necessary, to send 150,000 men to the Indian frontier and employ the whole Indian Army there. Who is going to command in the field? If you take your best soldier and send him to India as Commander-in-Chief, and if he is to be kept at Simla, then clearly you will employ a less good and less distinguished General in the field; and if you do not restrict yourselves to the officers who are actually in command in India at the time and send out some one from this country who may be of equal prestige and weight, you will, I think. be taking a very grave responsibility. There is great risk in sending out a man after a campaign has been begun to carry out operations in a country and with troops with which he has never been associated. For that reason I look upon the decision of the noble Viscount as premature and as not unlikely to cause embarrassment. I confess that I thought the account which he gave of the opinion of he Government of India was somewhat magnified and exaggerated. The Government of India took up practically a negative position. They said it was a question which might
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0027"/>
<col>47</col>
be dealt with some time, but both in their Despatch of 1908 and of 1907 they deprecated action being taken&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00238"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>:On the ground that it would lead to an acrimonious discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00239"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Their words were that they remained of the same opinion as in the previous year, and that opinion was that it would be undesirable that the question should be reopened at the moment. It is a curious fact that that opinion was actually signed by Sir Erle Richards and Sir E. N. Baker, two of those who were amongst the unanimous Council of the noble Lord against the change introduced. But if the noble Lord does not get support in India for massing all this work on the Commander-in-Chief, I look round this House and wonder what support he will receive here. We have heard one ex-Viceroy. We shall, before the close of the discussion, hear another ex-Viceroy in the person of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. We have heard an ex-Commander-in-Chief; and if Lord Cromer adds his weight to what has been said we shall have had as complete an expression of opinion as we could wish for. Lord Ampthill, I know, is of the same opinion.<lb/>
I would take this opportunity before I sit down of explaining that the majority of the Committee over which I presided at the India Office which made this change were originally disposed to accept the view which the Secretary of State has now adopted, but when we came to hear the opinions which we invited from several of those who had held high positions in India we found practical unanimity on the side of there being some second Military Member, not necessarily the same Military Member as before but some second Military authority, so as to avoid that overloading of the Commander-in-Chief of which so much has been said. It has been suggested that those opinions ought to have been published. I was unable to publish them. I should wish to have published them, but the Committee was a Departmental Committee. The opinions were asked for privately and were taken in a most informal manner. We asked&#x2014;
<quote>"Could India be conducted with the Commander-in-Chief as the sole administrator or could it not?"</quote>
<col>48</col>
and the opinion was that it could not. In those circumstances I cannot help regretting that the change has now been made, as I think, with undue precipitancy. I cannot but doubt whether the saving in money would be at all equal to the possible loss of efficiency in a campaign. For those reasons I would have earnestly asked the noble Viscount, if the matter had not already been carried out, to wait until this House had had an opportunity of expressing an opinion. Five years would not have been an undue period in which to test so important a machinery as that which we set in motion, and it would have enabled us to look round and see whether, under a new Commander-in-Chief, the working of the machinery was effective and in accordance with the wishes of the responsible Government of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00240"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount who has just sat down dwelt with very great reason upon the inconveniences arising from a dual system. A dual system is certainly a bad system, especially in connection with military matters; but I cannot help thinking that my noble friend rather forgot one point&#x2014;that in the opinion of many the dual system in India was imposed by the very special conditions of government in India. Observe the dilemma we get into if there is no dual system. Either you have entirely to exclude for all time officers with only English experience, or else you have to exclude temporarily officers with Indian experience. One of the reasons-why the dual system was adopted was in order to effect some compromise between those two apparently conflicting claims.<lb/>
In spite of the very great sympathy I have with the general policy adopted by the noble Viscount in India, I confess that the general impression left on my mind by recent Indian events is that we are perhaps going rather too fast. I cannot help fearing that there may be, at all events, some risk that the fundamental difficulties which underlie Indian problems may be rather forgotten. Indeed, I doubt whether public opinion in this country has as yet thoroughly grasped the great importance of the change made four years ago and which has now been stereotyped and confirmed by the noble Viscount. I cannot even help doubting whether the Government of India themselves have grasped the full importance of the matter. I share with the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0028"/>
<col>49</col>
noble Viscount some surprise in reading the remarks of the Government of India that they deprecated raising the question on account of its possibly leading to heated and acrimonious discussion. We have had a discussion to-night&#x2014;I think a useful discussion&#x2014;and certainly nobody call say that it has been either heated or acrimonious. The Government of India then went on to say that they left the whole of the political considerations involved in the hands of the Secretary of State. I ask myself, Were there not some political considerations which it was especially within the province of the Government of India to deal with? It certainly appeared to many of us that these political considerations existed in a high degree, and it was because they were, as we thought, insufficiently considered, and because the question was considered exclusively, as we thought, from the point of view of military efficiency, that many, myself among the number, were very doubtful as to the change which was effected four years ago.<lb/>
I think it should never be forgotten, and it cannot be too often repeated, that we are the only Imperial nation which endeavours to govern a dependency by means of a native army officered by Europeans. The whole of the so-called Asiatic Army of Russia in Central Asia is composed of Russians. The French native troops in Algeria are insignificant in point of number. In fact, you have to go back to the days of ancient Rome to find anything at all comparable to our experiment in India. At all events for half a century the relations between the ruled and the rulers in India have been satisfactory. On the one hand we have had conspicuous courage, loyalty, devotion, and discipline; and on the other hand the greatest care has been shown to avoid wounding the susceptibilities of the native troops. More than this, I think it ought never to be forgotten that during the great convulsion which happened fifty years ago in India no inconsiderable portion of the Native Army remained loyal to the Colours.<lb/>
But we should always remember that we have brought into existence one of the most delicate machines that has ever been created. What is the first question that a Viceroy, if he is a wise man, will ask himself when any proposal is put before him?
<col>50</col>
What was the first question I asked myself in Egypt, where we had a Moslem Army commanded by Europeans? The first question to ask is, How will this proposal affect the Native Army? I do not think anyone can hope to give a satisfactory answer to this question unless he has served with the Native Army and become thoroughly imbued with the habits, thoughts, and customs of the men. In these circumstances it appears to me to be very desirable that the Viceroy should always have at his elbow an officer of great experience who can give him the best possible advice on this particular subject. I maintain, therefore, that, whatever was done in the way of improved military administration, it was of absolute political necessity to leave this particular cogwheel of the administration intact.<lb/>
At no time did the necessity for having an officer of that kind at the elbow of the Viceroy exist more than at present. Although I am confident that the native troops will be able to resist the disintegrating influences being brought to bear upon them in India, and in England, I regret to say, with a recklessness it is impossible to condemn too strongly, I think every one must admit that the present situation is one that requires very great watchfulness. Under the old system there was always such an officer present, either the Commander-in-Chief or the Military Member of Council. Speaking from my own experience, I can say that the presence on the Viceroy's Council of Lord Napier of Magdala, of Lord Roberts, of Sir Donald Stewart, and of Sir Henry Norman was of enormous value, not merely on account of their vast military knowledge and experience, but on general grounds. Everyone who has been in India knows the difficulty of keeping in touch with native public opinion. No class of officials in India is more valuable in respect to informing the Government of the feelings and habits and customs of the natives than officers who have served in the Native Army. In some respects I am not sure that their opinions are not more valuable than those of civilians, for, as the noble Viscount remarked in a speech at Oxford, the tendency of modern administrative systems is to chain civilians exclusively to their desks and to give them less opportunity of mixing with the natives than was formerly the case.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0029"/>
<col>51</col>
A very heavy blow was given to the system, which I think was, on the whole, a good one, four years ago, At the same time the framework was left intact&#x2014;that is to say, the Supply Member of Council, although he might have had very little Departmental work to do, would still have been at the Viceroy's right hand, and if he had been, as he ought to have been, an experienced officer, he would have been able to advise him on the points with which I have dealt. That arrangement was, no doubt, a compromise. The noble Lord opposite alluded to some words which have been frequently quoted of the noble Marquess behind me, in which he said that the arrangement was not a final one. I think the noble Viscount appeared to imagine that that was almost a justification out of the mouth of his political opponents for the change. The noble Marquess is here and it is for him to explain his meaning, but I am bound to confess that the way I understood the noble Marquess's remark, and I think the way it was generally understood in the country, was that if a change were made it would not be in the direction of giving a <i>coup de gr&#x00E2;ce</i> to the new member of Council, but rather of restoring to him some of his old authority. Now the old system, which may have been faulty in detail, but which, I think, was wise and statesmanlike in its broad outlines, has received its <i>coup de gr&#x00E2;ce</i>.<lb/>
The reasons given for the change are purely financial and seem to me inadequate. I should be the first to deprecate economy, whether in this country or in India, but I think this is a matter of such vital importance that the saving of 10,000<i>l</i>. or 12,000<i>l</i>. a year, which I believe is the amount involved, should not be allowed to weigh. Parsimony in this direction also contrasts rather strangely with the somewhat lavish expenditure which is about to be incurred in giving the people of India the doubtful boon of <i>quasi</i>-Parliamentary institutions. Everybody will recognise the desirability of keeping thoroughly in touch with the feelings of the Native Army, but I have heard it argued that that could be done perfectly well without the old system; that it could be done by means of Staff officers or by the Secretary of the Army Department, and that that would supply the want of a Military Member of Council. I have had some experience of that system, and have
<col>52</col>
no hesitation in saying that it cannot be counted upon to work well. It is really putting too great a strain upon military discipline, I might almost say that it is putting too great a strain on human nature, to expect that a subordinate officer will frankly express his opinion against his superior when he knows his future career will depend on that superior himself. I do not think that if the Viceroy should have any doubt as to the wisdom of advice tendered him by the Commander-in-Chief he should be obliged to go to any subordinate at all. The system is not fair on the Viceroy; I hardly think it is fair on the Commander-in-Chief; it certainly is not fair on the officers consulted. The Viceroy should always have at his side an officer who will give his opinion with that amount of frankness which can only arise from having a thoroughly independent position.<lb/>
Then there is another defence of the change which I have heard raised, though not in this House, and that is that this is not found necessary in this country. That is perfectly true. The Secretary of State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty are not professional men, and they have no difficulty in getting professional advice from those under them. The circumstances in India are absolutely different. I am not by any means enamoured of the idea of soldier and sailor politicians. I think the less soldiers and sailors interfere with politics the better; but it must not be forgotten that the treatment of the Native Army in India is the most vital political question in that country. The result is that the Commander-in-Chief or the Military Member is forced, by the necessity of his situation, if he does his duty, to be more or less a politician. On these grounds I do not, think there is any sound analogy between India and this country. These are, very briefly stated, the reasons why I regret the change that has been made. I hope there will be no immediate result, but I cannot help thinking that, sooner or later, we run considerable risk of regretting the change now made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00241"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with some diffidence that I approach this question after the discussion this evening by noble Lords who from their experience in Indian administration have a far wider and more comprehensive view
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0030"/>
<col>53</col>
of this subject than I can pretend to; but having spent many years in India and the subject being of considerable interest to the Army, I venture to ask your Lordships' kind indulgence.<lb/>
The noble Lord who brought this subject forward has dealt very fully with the constitutional and administrative issues involved. As regards the latter, he informed us that the work which will now devolve on the Commander-in-Chief is too much for any one man to perform. If we examine the business formerly dealt with by the Military Supply Department, we find seven branches of administrative work, but it is work of a technical nature, and, as such, can only be performed by the heads of the departments dealing with it. The most onerous of any extra work falling on any department is that which will now devolve upon the Military Finance Secretariat, of which the staff has, in consequence, been strengthened. The work which will fall upon the Commander-in Chief is mainly that of supervision.<lb/>
Doubtless under the system of a few years ago the executive duties of the Commander-in-Chief, necessitating the inspection of troops scattered over a vast area, might have proved somewhat onerous combined with his new administrative duties, which entail a closer supervision of office work at headquarters. But a feature of the Army reorganisation scheme has been the introduction of greater decentralisation. General Officers commanding Divisions have had considerable financial and administrative powers delegated to them, and I think it is no longer necessary&#x2014;I should have said no longer right&#x2014;for the Commander-in-Chief to personally supervise the training of the smaller units of the Army. This devolution of authority must relieve the Army Department of a considerable amount of correspondence and work, and the work which now devolves on the Commander-in-Chief is certainly no more than that which falls on the Viceroy. I do not suppose that Lord Curzon would admit that the office of Governor-General of India threw more work on him than he could perform; yet that office embraced the supervision of all the work, not only of the Army Department, but of all the other Departments in the Government of India.<lb/>
<col>54</col>
As regards the suggestion that the duties which the noble Lord defined as those of administration and those of executive command should be kept distinct, I think it is difficult to draw a dividing line between the two. The executive command of an Army must include the administration of its fighting power, and an Army which is divorced from the services on which it depends for its subsistence and equipment has no fighting power and cannot be considered as a fighting machine. The disastrous results of divided control resulting in an ill-defined responsibility in war were recognised by the late Government, and the abolition of the Military Department was the outcome of its policy. I will not dwell on the latest development in these changes in our administration. The formation of the Military Supply Department was certainly required while the success or failure of the previous changes was still uncertain. It has, however, been abolished with the full acquiescence of the Government of India.<lb/>
In September, 1907, the Governor-General in Council stated that the Army Department had proved fully able to dispose of all the work which had been entrusted to it, and that the smoothness of working of the new administrative machine compared very favourably with the condition of affairs that had existed in the office of the Commander-in-Chief and late Military Member before the latter was abolished. Following that statement a whole year elapsed before any action was taken. This gave ample time for the Government of India to recast their views, if necessary, under the experience gained during that period. That they did not alter their views, and that they still recommended on the same grounds the abolition of the Department of Military Supply, is, I think, the very best testimony as to the wisdom of the previous changes in our Army administration.<lb/>
But the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, has objected to these changes on constitutional as well as administrative grounds. I gather that he considers that the changes strike at the very root of the constitutional authority of the Government, setting up in its place a dangerous military autocracy. But are military autocracies so easily introduced or so greatly to be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0031"/>
<col>55</col>
feared in these days? Are we not rather setting up a cry of two centuries ago than dealing with the practical issues of the present day? In any case two important provisions have been made to safeguard the constitutional authority of the Government. These are the revival of the Mobilisation Committee and the appointment of a Secretary to the Government in the Army Department. This Secretary has direct access to the Viceroy, and it is his duty to see that the fullest possible information and the opinions of the members of the Mobilisation Committee are laid before the Viceroy before a question is considered in Council.<lb/>
As these measures are not considered by Lord Curzon a sufficient safeguard against a military autocracy I can only suppose that it is on the grounds that this Secretary in the Army Department might be diffident of expressing any opinion or criticism on the policy of his superior officer. Personally I hold a different opinion, but in any case I think we have an efficient safeguard in the Mobilisation Committee. Without undertaking such a retrogressive step as the reintroduction of the Military Department with its duplication of work and its many inherent evils, is it not wiser to move along more progressive lines and make use of this Mobilisation Committee, which is certainly an efficient guarantee against ill-considered advice being tendered to the Viceroy? The subsequent scrutiny to which all measures of importance are subjected, by the Governor-General's Council in India, by the Secretary of State in this country and his Council at the India Office, and by debates in Parliament, is surely sufficient to allay any fears as to a military autocracy. Five officers sit on this Mobilisation Committee, including the Secretary in the Army Department, who is appointed by the Viceroy. If this is not a safeguard, Lord Curzon must apparently question the independence of these officers in committee. But I hardly think the noble Lord does justice to the integrity and sense of duty of the British officer. Certainly in this case whatever criticisms it might be the duty of these officers to make while on the Mobilisation Committee would in no way be subversive of discipline. We have practically the counterpart of this Mobilisation Committee in this country in the Army Council. Surely it is safer for the Viceroy to rely on the carefully-
<col>56</col>
debated opinions of the General Officers sitting on this Committee than on the advice of the one General, however able an administrator he might be, who under the late system held the post of Military Member.<lb/>
There is one other point which the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, touched upon as regards the Indian Army. The treatment of this Army and the protection of its idiosyncracies is of vital importance, and it has been suggested that the Commander-in-Chief, being frequently of the British service, might have no knowledge and no experience of the Indian Army. But this contention, I think, ignores the fact that at least two of the senior officers of his Department must belong to the Native Army. These officers can always appeal to the Viceroy through the Secretary to the Government in the Army Department. Then, again, there is the Mobilisation Committee, through whose hands all measures affecting the Native Army must pass. But, apart from these safeguards, is there any reason for regarding the Military Member as being specially qualified to protect the interests of the Indian Army? It was not unusual to find that the Military Member had little or no experience of that actual regimental service with native troops which is usually considered necessary to give an intimate understanding of the native soldier. Sir Edmond Elles was never in the Indian Army, though his long experience in India, in command of troops and on active service, doubtless gave him a good knowledge of its customs and traditions. But this knowledge and this experience is almost invariably shared by every Commander-in-Chief in India. I must, however, except Lord Kitchener, whose distinguished services had prior to his present appointment been rendered in other countries. I do not wish to infer that Sir Edmond Elles was not in every way thoroughly competent to protect the interests of the Indian Army. His eminent services to the Indian Empire and to the Army in particular places him above such criticism. But I do wish to ask your Lordships why this Military Member, who apparently need not necessarily even belong to the Indian Army, should have been considered better qualified to protect its interests than the General Officers belonging to that service who now sit on the Mobilisation Committee. I trust I am not regarding this question solely from a
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0032"/>
<col>57</col>
soldier's point of view when I say that the late system of divided control and divided responsibility was bad in peace and quite impossible in war. We have now been given a sound military system and soldiers are not so deficient in intellect as to render it necessary to alter that system or to adapt it to the individual; rather is it the duty of the Government to exercise a wise discrimination in selecting the individual to fill the responsible post of administrator of the system.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00266"><member>LORD RITCHIE OF DUNDEE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in asking your Lordships to give this Bill a Second Reading I am afraid I must detain you for a few moments, owing to the Amendment standing on the Paper in the name of Lord Montagu for the rejection of the Bill. The object of the Bill, in the words of the Preamble, is to&#x2014;
<quote>"regulate the traffic in the streets of the City of London so as to prevent obstruction and to enable the increasing traffic of the City to be conducted with less delay and in a safer manner."</quote>
The Bill passed its Second Reading in the other House without opposition. It then went to the Local Legislation Committee of that House, and passed through that Committee with a few Amendments. The only serious opposition, I understand, came from omnibus owners, and the part of the Bill to which they objected was this provision in subsection (2) of Clause 2&#x2014;
<quote>"The Court of Mayor and Aldermen with the approval of the said Secretary of State may from time to time make regulations to be observed by all persons within the City with respect to the following matters namely:&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>(<i>a</i>) The route to be taken by all vehicles or any particular class or description of vehicles with power to prohibit or to permit on certain specified conditions either generally or during particular hours the passing of all vehicles or any particular class or description of vehicles into or along any street or part of a street."</quote>
I understand that the noble Lord who will move the rejection of the Bill shares the views which were expressed by the omnibus owners when the Bill was before the Committee in the other House. On the other hand, the promoters of the Bill maintain that by this provision the Bill will give effect to certain recommendations contained in the Report of the Royal Commission on London Traffic.

the proposed power of regulating traffic, and stated that omnibuses formed such a large part of the traffic of London that some regulations as to routes in their case were essential.<lb/>
The promoters of the Bill contend that the interests of the public generally, and of omnibus owners in particular, are fully safeguarded by the provision requiring the approval of the Secretary of State before any regulations can be put in force, and, further, by the proviso in subsection (2)&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that the Court of Mayor and Aldermen shall hold a public inquiry before making any regulation with reference to any of the matters aforesaid."</quote>
I know that the opponents of the Bill argue that it would enable the City authorities to exclude any particular kind of traffic from the streets, such as motor omnibuses; but it cannot be supposed that, even if the authorities wished to do anything of the kind, the Secretary of State would give his approval. The promoters of the Bill do not wish to exclude any traffic at all. Their object is to regulate the traffic, and when I tell your Lordships that between the hours of eight in the morning and eight in the evening over 7,000 omnibuses pass the Mansion House I think it will be admitted that it is highly desirable they should be regulated. Many of these omnibuses follow the same line along streets which are congested by traffic, and I submit that it would be much to the convenience not only of the public, but of the omnibus proprietors themselves, that certain of these vehicles should be diverted along parallel streets, so that those going in one direction should pass along one street and those going in the opposite direction along another. Those are the objects which the promoters of this Bill have in view. They do not for a moment wish to exclude any particular traffic. I hope that with these assurances the noble Lord may see his way to withdraw his Amendment for the rejection of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<col>62</col>
so moderate in tone that I confess I am to a certain extent disarmed. But I think the House should realise that if this Bill passes in the form in which it is presented to-day it will be introducing a very important new principle in our legislation. For the first time it is proposed in the regulation of traffic to allow a preference to be given to some vehicles as compared with others.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00269">If the Traffic Board recommended by the Royal Commission were to-day in existence, I for one would be quite content to refer this and other matters of a highly contentious nature which have to do with London traffic to that Board; but owing to reasons too long to discuss to-day that Traffic Board is not in existence. I regret it very much. The result is that we see in this Bill an attempt of one part of London to legislate for traffic without any reference to the remaining parts. That is rather a serious principle to introduce without very careful consideration. I maintain that, as a general rule, the traffic of a great city should be interdependent and should be regulated by the various authorities acting together. It seems to me that to give the City of London power to stop any particular class of traffic within its area will be introducing a dangerous principle. I admit that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are people of common sense who would be likely to do their best to act with justice, but if the powers sought are granted to them they must be extended to others. The power of excluding traffic from streets, if placed in the hands of such a body as the London County Council, which owns tramways, might lead to a very difficult and contentious position. Interference of this kind has hitherto only taken place in the Royal parks, but there is a provision that the regulations have to be laid on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament for forty days, which gives an opportunity, if necessary, for protest to be made and for Parliament to interfere. There is no such safeguard provided by the present Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00270">My noble friend referred to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on London Traffic. I have again read the passages in the Report which refer to this particular point. First of all, with regard to routes for vehicles, they recount that in the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, there was a proviso that the number of metropolitan stage coaches that might pass down
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0035"/>
<col>63</col>
any street should not be limited. That is a very important point, because it shows that as long ago as 1867 Parliament realised that the number of services plying for public use on the streets must not be limited. In paragraph 167 of their Report the Commissioners say that if mitigation of existing evils is to be carried out and if traffic is to be controlled in any way, this should be combined with street improvements providing alternative routes. With that we shall all be in agreement. In Paragraph 168 the Commissioners say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is obvious that in prescribing routes for vehicles, the case of omnibuses plying for hire requires special consideration. It would inflict loss on the owners of such omnibuses, and be an inconvenience to the public, if omnibuses were excluded from streets where they had to set down, or were expected to pick up, any considerable number of passengers."</quote>
That is so strong that I think I hardly need argue it further.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00271">It is obvious that, after hearing all the evidence, the Royal Commission came to the conclusion that it would be dangerous to interfere with omnibus traffic using certain streets. They suggested that a method of overcoming the difficulty would be by&#x2014;
<quote>"leaving the making of regulations in the hands of the Commissioners of Police and providing that the London County Council, the Corporation of the City of London, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be authorised to suggest to the Commissioners of Police routes for vehicles which, after examination by the proposed Traffic Board, might be approved or rejected, or approved on conditions, by the Secretary of State for the Home Department."</quote>
Unfortunately we have not yet got a Traffic Board. I do think the powers which the City is asking for in this Bill are very dangerous powers, and I am rather inclined to the opinion that we ought to object to this Bill unless we can get concessions in Committee to meet the objections I have stated. The danger of the provision in subsection (2) of Clause 2 which the noble Lord in charge of the Bill read to your Lordships was recognised in the other House, and the proviso to which Lord Ritchie also referred was inserted. My Amendment for the rejection of the Bill was prepared prior to the insertion of that proviso, which only shows how strong my case would have been had the Bill not been so amended.</p>
<col>64</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00272">I have in my hand one of the plans which the City authorities have drawn up showing how the proposed alternative routes might be worked. It is proposed not to allow omnibuses which come from certain parts of London to go in front of the Mansion House, but to divert them. The Mansion House is one of the great places for the exchange of traffic, and if omnibuses coming from certain parts of London are no longer allowed to go in front of it, as is proposed, much inconvenience may be caused to passengers. It may be said that the fact that the approval of the Home Office is necessary before the regulations could come into force would be a sufficient safeguard against injustice; but the Home Office are not really experts in this matter. The provision would be, no doubt, a great safeguard, but the question is whether it would be a sufficient safeguard. I do not wish to detain the House longer. I shall be content if the promoters can suggest between now and the Committee stage some means of further safeguarding paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (2) of Clause 2; and I suggest that it might be done by the machinery of the Parks Act requiring that the regulations should be laid on the Tables of both Houses for forty clays. I regard the clause as it stands as a dangerous one, and I therefore move the Amendment standing in my name.</p>

As in the case of all private Bills, the Government Department concerned are entirely neutral; and I can only say, on their behalf, that they think this a very proper subject to go before a Committee of your Lordships' House. We have had a useful discussion, and I think those of your Lordships who have listened to it will agree that this is just the kind of subject which will be best discussed by a Committee of the House, before whom the parties may argue their case. We submit that the Committee will be better able to decide the matters put before it than your Lordships on such an occasion as this. In these circumstances I would
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0036"/>
<col>65</col>
venture, especially as there is an important debate coming on this afternoon, to suggest that your Lordships should agree to this Bill being sent to a Committee in the usual way; and if the noble Lord is dissatisfied with the conclusions of the Committee he will have an opportunity of raising the matter at a subsequent stage of the Bill in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00275"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I might say a word or two on this Bill. The noble Lord who moved its rejection made a great point that the Bill contained a new principle. I venture to say that the principle is not really a new one at all. Parliament for many years past has given powers for the regulation of traffic to local authorities both inside and outside the City. It is quite true that the Bill contains one proposal which is to some extent novel&#x2014;namely, that the City authorities should be enabled to place a limit on the number of vehicles that may use a particular street. That in itself is new; but I think the noble Lord will find that the promoters of the Bill have adhered as closely as possible to the recommendations of the London Traffic Commission, and that in effect the object of the Bill is to carry out the recommendations made to Parliament by that Commission.<lb/>
The noble Lord is afraid of what I suppose he would call the "thin end of the wedge." He is afraid that if you allow the Corporation of the City of London to regulate traffic within their area you may not be able to refuse similar facilities to the body governing the metropolis outside the City, who are themselves owners of a form of traffic which would compete with motor-omnibuses, in which, I think, the noble Lord is interested. I do not attach much importance to that, because, after all, the City is a very peculiar portion of the metropolis. It is by far the most crowded area except certain isolated parts, and I would venture to say that the neighbourhood of the Mansion House is probably the most crowded spot in the whole of the metropolis. I think we may safely leave it to the good sense and the good feeling of the Corporation of the City of London, whose only desire would be to meet the public convenience.<lb/>
I think there need be no fear that the Corporation of the City of London will seek to stop the passage of all motor-omnibuses
<col>66</col>
or motors through the City; they will only regulate them so as to cause the least inconvenience, and so that the use of the streets may be secured for the greatest number of His Majesty's subjects. The noble Lord's objection is confined, I think, to one single point. He desires that Parliament should be able to exercise control over any regulations made by the City Corporation. But no regulations can take effect until they have the sanction of the Secretary of State. The noble Earl who has just spoken, like the poor, we have always with us, and if at any time regulations are made which do not commend themselves to my noble friend who has moved the rejection of this Bill he has every opportunity of putting a Question to the representative of the Home Office and of discussing the matter in your Lordships' House. In these circumstances I hope your Lordships will allow the Bill to be read a second time and to go to a Committee, where the matter can be discussed at greater length and at greater leisure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00276"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I saw the Amendment on the Paper I came down to the House prepared to extend to my noble friend a rather qualified support. I hope he will not think that support so qualified as not to be worth having. But on the general question of the regulation of traffic I take a very strong view that in a town traffic cannot be too closely or minutely regulated, and in a paper which I read on the "Scientific Regulation of Traffic" some two years ago I advocated a far more minute and strict regulation of traffic than does take place in towns. I think that by careful regulation of traffic the capacity of our existing streets could be enormously increased, and that if we gave our minds to scientific regulation we should be able to do without a great many of the street improvements now forced upon us. Therefore, so far as regulation goes, I am not sure that I am a supporter of the noble Lord in his opposition to the Bill.<lb/>
I do not think the noble Earl who spoke on behalf of the Home Office quite sufficiently appreciated the point made by Lord Montagu. It was hardly a point of detail for Committee, but rather a point of principle as to the regulation of traffic, not by a town for itself, but by a particular small area in a town, which would affect the traffic of the whole of that town. The City is a very important area of London, and while personally very much
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0037"/>
<col>67</col>
in sympathy with the desire of that authority to regulate their traffic&#x2014;and I admire the way in which the traffic is now regulated in the City, though it is by no means perfect&#x2014;I suggest that it is rather a dangerous principle to give a small spot like that, in the centre of a large metropolis, power to control, without much check, traffic that goes through from all sides. There is a check&#x2014;an important one&#x2014;in the requirement of the sanction of the Secretary of State. I attach more importance to that almost than to the laying of the regulations on the Table of your Lordships' House, because in the case, to which my noble friend referred, of the Royal parks, I think some of the regulations were made by a species of device, which was held, it is true, by the Divisional Court to be a legal device, but which had the effect of withdrawing the regulations from the Table of Parliament. Consequently Parliament never had an opportunity of discussing, among other regulations, the one prescribing ten miles an hour for motorcars. Therefore I attach more importance to the sanction of the Secretary of State being required than to the laying of the regulations on the Table of Parliament.<lb/>
I agree that it is not likely that regulations would be made by the City authorities to which in themselves objection could be taken, but I do not wish to see this principle extended and every borough council in London asking for similar powers over their particular area. If the power sought for is allowed in this instance, I hope it will be regarded as special to the City and not as a power which it is desirable to extend to any other part of London.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INDIAN MILITARY ADMINISTRATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00284">Order of the Day read for resuming the adjourned Debate on the Motion of Lord Curzon of Kedleston, that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to recent changes in the Military administration of the Government of India.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00285"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel strongly that it is my duty to speak out my mind to your Lordships on this question. It is not a pleasant or an easy duty to discharge, for it obliges me to express serious disagreement with some of those under whom I served and with whom I worked while I was in India, and from all of whom I met with kindness and friendship which I shall ever remember gratefully. As regards the two great adversaries in the famous controversy which ended in the calamitous resignation of my noble friend who opened this discussion, I will only say that it is possible, indeed it is inevitable, to admire the great work which was done by either of them, although it is necessary to disagree with one or the other. I there-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0038"/>
<col>69</col>
fore wish to say at the very outset that I am second to none in my admiration for the great work which has been done by Lord Kitchener, and which I venture to think stands quite apart from this particular question of the administration of the Army in India.<lb/>
Perhaps I may explain the special responsibility which I feel in regard to this question by reminding your Lordships that for a while I was the "man on the spot" in India with regard to this question. For a period of eight months&#x2014;no inconsiderable time in the evolution of an important political question&#x2014;I was actually in the thick of the controversy, and I was personally responsible for the initiation and the execution of important changes which preceded the revolutionary change of the system. I think there must be others besides myself who felt a strong disappointment at the speech of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India. I venture to think that that speech did not rise to the height of the occasion in the manner which all his former speeches have led us to expect. I was particularly sorry that he introduced a personal note which was singularly and admirably absent from the speech of my noble friend who opened this discussion. He did not, I venture to think, treat my noble friend quite fairly, and, indeed, on one occasion I thought that he used a dum-dum bullet bearing the obsolete mark of the Army Department in India. They have quite a peculiar whistle, those bullets. The speech seemed to me to have been prepared against circumstances which did not arise. It was evident that the noble Viscount expected to find himself in the position of a <i>tertius gaudens</i> in a personal controversy between my noble friend who opened the debate and my noble friend the late Secretary of State for India.<lb/>
But the greatest disappointment was when the Secretary of State declared that he did not even then know what was the practical object which my noble friend had in view, or how he himself was concerned by the raising of this question at this time. I will tell the noble Viscount what is the practical object of raising this question, and I will try to do so in language so simple that it is impossible for him to misunderstand it. The system which was instituted by the late Government in 1905 has broken down or, if you prefer
<col>70</col>
to say so, come to an end. That is an undeniable fact. What remains of that system has been condemned in theory by every single authority, including the late Government. That, again, is a fact which is beyond dispute. Therefore, we wish to know whether the Secretary of State is content that things should remain as they are, or whether he is contemplating any future change, or, at any rate, the consideration of possible change. I think that that is a practical object of the greatest importance. It is a question which we are in every way justified in raising.<lb/>
I will try to explain a little more fully, and will begin with the predictions of my noble friend over which the Secretary of State for India made merry. He was, I think, rather unfair when he included in them rhetorical arguments which did not pretend to be predictions. The real predictions of the late Viceroy were contained in his telegraphic Despatch of August 10, 1905. I will give chapter and verse, and ask your Lordships to judge of the fulfilment from the facts which are before the House in the Papers recently presented. After summarising the proposals which had been made by the Commander-in-Chief for carrying out the orders of the Secretary of State, the Viceroy wrote as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"Whatever be the merits of individual proposals in the above list, their net result can only be to concentrate all military power in the hands of Army Headquarters, to lead to serious congestion of business, and to reduce the Military Supply Department to impotence. Indeed, in those circumstances the creation of a Military Supply Member would involve an unpardonable waste of public money, and it would be better to dispense with the Department altogether."</quote>
The Papers recently presented to Parliament record the striking fulfilment of that prediction. The Military Supply Department was at once reduced to impotence, and has consequently been abolished on the very ground that it would be a waste of public money. All military power has, as a necessary consequence, passed into the hands of the Headquarters Staff of the Army, and there is, so I hear, serious congestion. This does not appear on the Papers, but I think I shall be able to show your Lordships how impossible it is that it should be otherwise. The main point is that the system inaugurated early in 1906 has failed, or, if you prefer it, come to an end. That is an undeniable fact. Before three years had elapsed it had to be changed in its most essential and
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0039"/>
<col>71</col>
vital principle. If that is not failure, I do not know what failure is.<lb/>
Now I should like to explain, if I may, the principle which has had to be sacrificed to the new system. Your Lordships may remember that in May, 1905, a Committee, to which reference has already been made, was appointed to inquire into the system of Army administration in India. That Committee, after careful consideration, reported that two courses were open. The first was that the Military Member should be abolished altogether and that the Commander-in-Chief should take over his functions; the second was that the Military Member was to be retained, but that his duties and responsibilities were to be largely reduced. The Committee said that they were forced&#x2014;I ask your Lordships to mark the word "forced"&#x2014;to discard the first alternative, and accordingly they recommended the second. Now the singular result of the adoption of their proposal is that it has led immediately to the substitution of the alternative course which they had rejected on the ground&#x2014;again most important to note&#x2014;that it would be opposed to all modern principles with regard to Army administration. That is what has been done. That is what you have got now. You have a system which is opposed to all modern principles in regard to armies, and I do not see how you can possibly get away from that position. They say that extremes meet, but I cannot recall any instance in which the results of political action have proved so absolutely contrary to the intentions of Statesmen.<lb/>
How are we to account for this singular failure? It seems to me&#x2014;it has always seemed to me from the beginning&#x2014;that it was due to a want of understanding and appreciation of the elementary principles underlying the constitution of the Government of India. We in India&#x2014;and when I say we in India I mean the overwhelming mass of articulate public opinion, much of which was strongly opposed to my noble friend on every other subject&#x2014;we in India were simply astounded at the misapprehension, the elementary misconception, which underlay much of the criticism which was made in this country, and which influenced opinion in this country. The position was simplicity itself, but it was not understood in England. The very reference to the Committee to which I have just alluded
<col>72</col>
betrays this extraordinary misunderstanding. This was the first question which was put to them&#x2014;
<quote>"Whether it is advisable that Army administration in India should, subject to the Viceroy in Council, be, as at present, under two separate heads of departments?"</quote>
It would be inconceivable if it had not actually occurred that such a misleading, fallacious, incorrect and question-begging direction could have been drafted in the India Office.<lb/>
Army administration in India was not under two separate heads of departments until the late Government made it so in 1905. It was no more under two departments than Army administration was in this country when we had a Commander-in-Chief. Army administration was under the Government of India; the Military Department was the War Office of India; the Military Member was the War Minister&#x2014;the Secretary of State for War of India. The Commander-in-Chief&#x2014;and this is the point&#x2014;was not a War Minister at all. He was the executive head of the Army, and in that capacity he was a subordinate of the Government of India in Council. The administration of the military machine rested with the Government of India, whose only representative for that purpose in the Indian Cabinet was the Military Member. The position of Commander-in-Chief in Council was, I maintain, mainly honorific. He was put there to increase his status and his prestige. He had no portfolio, but, so far as he was a Minister at all and had to take part in administrative duties, his functions were dual. His distinctive and exceptional position was marked by his very designation, held only by himself, as Extraordinary Member of Council. When this is understood it must be apparent to all those who have any acquaintance with the analogous system of Government in this country that much of the criticism which prevailed in England proceeded from misapprehension, which was, to say the least of it, inexcusable.<lb/>
There was talk of the iniquity of the Military Member giving orders to the Commander-in-Chief, who was his senior in rank and superior in military reputation. The Military Member no more gave orders than Mr. McKenna gives orders to the Navy; and as regards his military position, it had nothing more to do with his position than the rank of my noble friend as an officer
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0040"/>
<col>73</col>
of Yeomanry had to do with his position when he was Secretary of State for War. The Military Member was merely the agent and the mouthpiece of the Government of India. Just as well might it have been said that it is iniquitous for Mr. Haldane, who is not a soldier at all, to presume to give orders to a soldier of such eminence and high rank as His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught. The late Duke of Cambridge was, so far as I am aware, well able to adapt himself to precisely similar conditions.<lb/>
Again, it was said to be monstrous that the proposals of the Commander-in-Chief should be criticised by officers junior in rank. Is there nothing of the kind in this country? Surely every noble Lord who knows anything of the inside of a Government office will see a hundred analogies. Supposing that my noble friend the Leader of the House, in his capacity as Secretary of State for the Colonies, submits to the Treasury some scheme for the improvement of a Crown Colony. That proposal will, as a matter of course, be criticised, in the first instance, by the junior clerks of the Treasury, who will bring to bear on it their knowledge of precedent, their practised judgment, and all those other qualities which we expect of the Civil Service. I have never heard of any Minister in this country stipulating that his proposals should be dealt with only by his colleagues in the Cabinet. Why, even the proposals of the Prime Minister himself, so far as I am aware, are constantly and regularly submitted to the criticism of junior clerks. It is the ordinary, necessary, inevitable, official procedure, and I cannot for the life of me see that it is more of an indignity to a soldier than it is to a civilian. As a matter of fact, this thing happens daily in the course of ordinary military administration. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War opposite will no doubt bear me out in that. I think I am right in saying that the proposals of Generals may be negatived by Staff captains acting as the mouthpieces and delegates of higher authority.<lb/>
But in all this criticism the other side of the question was quite forgotten. It was forgotten that nine out of ten proposals which were made in the name of the Commander-in-Chief were made without his personal cognisance by junior officers acting in his name. I should also like to point out that there is nothing at all unparalleled in the former relative positions of the Com-
<col>74</col>
mander-in-Chief and the Military Member. We have only to look to the greatest of all armies&#x2014;the German Army&#x2014;to find a parallel. I have it on good authority that the question of seniority as between the War Minister and the Generals commanding Army corps does not arise. The present War Minister, I am told, was junior to all the Generals commanding Army corps at the time of his appointment; but the Germans are sufficiently capable of "clear thinking" to be able to distinguish between administrative and executive functions, and to treat a War Minister as a War Minister even though he sometimes may wear a military uniform. It was confusion of thought on these ordinary elementary principles of the Constitution which led to a change which I always have regarded and always shall regard as disastrous.<lb/>
And now, my Lords, you have a principle of papal infallibility established at the head of the military hierarchy in India. Any officer who denies that infallibility has been, is, and will be in a military sense excommunicated, and that is what we mean by the military autocracy which the Secretary of State for India derided with so much levity. Most of your Lordships know what military discipline means. Discipline is required, not only in the Army, but in other branches of life; but military discipline has something quite distinctive about it. It means in a very peculiar sense subordination of private judgment as well as obedience to orders, and that principle, which is universal among soldiers, has now been rendered absolute by the famous <i>dictum</i> that no officer junior to the Commander-in-Chief may criticise anything that the Commander-in-Chief proposes.<lb/>
Think, my Lords, what that means. It means, although the Secretary of State denies it, the establishment of a military autocracy of the most exaggerated type. It means that the Commander-in-Chief is deprived of all the advantages which civil Ministers derive from the varied experience and the trained judgment of their official subordinates. It means that if there should be discontent at any proposal of the Commander-in-Chief in India, not a breath or suspicion of it will reach these shores, or even the Government of India, through official channels. All this may be right so long as the present Commander-in-Chief remains in office, but we cannot expect that the infallibility of all future Commanders-in-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0041"/>
<col>75</col>
Chief can be absolutely relied upon. I said at the outset that there was congestion of business at the present time. I think it follows from what I said just now that that congestion is not likely to be admitted in any official Papers. It would not be in official human nature to make such a confession, and every Department at all times naturally defends itself. But I think I can show that it is inevitable that there should be such congestion. Under the old system there were four Commands, which at the last were reduced to three. The Lieut.-Generals at the head of those Commands had charge both of administration and training. Now, under the present system there are two Army commanders, commanding the Armies of the North and the South, who are really inspecting officers charged only with the training of the troops. They do not touch administration at all. Therefore, the whole of the administration is now centralised at Army headquarters, which has to deal direct with ten divisions and four independent brigades.<lb/>
It is a well-known and much-quoted maxim of Napoleon, that no Commander should have to deal with more than four or five subordinates. The Commander-in-Chief, in his dual capacity as Secretary of State for War in India and Commander-in-Chief, has now to deal with fourteen subordinates instead of the three which existed under the old system. I think it must be obvious to anyone who knows anything at all about military correspondence and the methods which are peculiar to it, that the delays and the confusion must be proportionately increased. It is quite true that the power of the divisional Generals has been increased so that they are able to dispose offhand of more buisness than they did before, but this could have been done under the old system, and it is not in any way a direct consequence of the introduction of the new system. To resume, the system set up by the late Government broke down in practice. That which remains has been condemned in theory by every authority, including the late Government themselves.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00287"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: The late Government condemned a system under which the Commander-in-Chief would be the only Military Member of Council. It cannot be denied. The only test of
<col>76</col>
armies and of military organisation is the test of war, and what we are here to ask the Secretary of State is whether we are going to wait until that test is applied. If so, do your Lordships contemplate with equanimity the one result which is absolutely certain&#x2014;the immediate disintegration of the Indian War Office, for it is intended that the Commander-in-Chief and the principal officers on the Headquarters Staff, who, as your Lordships know, are also the principal officers of the Indian War Office, should take the field?<lb/>
The Secretary of State said that no Commander-in-Chief had taken the field since 1857, and seemed to imply thereby that it was not likely he would do so. But he might have remembered that in 1857 it was the field which took the Commander-in-Chief, and that is exactly the contingency which we have to contemplate again. It might be inevitable that the Commander-in-Chief should take the field. I ask your Lordships, Can you conduct a big war without a War Office? It is quite true that the idea is to replace the members of the Indian War Office with substitutes, but there is an old, and, I think, a true maxim which says that it is not advisable to swop horses when you are crossing a stream. This is not a matter for expert military opinion or for the elaborate theories of constitution-mongers. It is a matter of common sense, and I ask, from the point of view of common sense, Are your Lordships content that the Indian War Office should be put under new and untried men the very moment a big war breaks out? To ask this question is the practical object of raising this discussion.<lb/>
I should like to assure the Secretary of State that, so far as I am concerned, and certainly from what my noble friend who opened the debate said, there is no question of criticising his action. My noble friend and I agree that it was absolutely inevitable that the Supply and Transport Department should go. That was what my noble friend predicted, and, that being so, it is impossible for him to criticise the Secretary of State. But what we do want to know is whether the noble Viscount is satisfied with the present system, or whether he thinks there is good cause for considering further changes. I venture to think that the experience which I had the honour to enjoy as serving the Crown in India still charges me as a member of this House with some re-

<col>77</col>
sponsibility for Indian affairs. I feel so strongly on this question that I was prepared to raise it myself, and, as your Lordships may remember, I put a Motion on the Paper which had the effect, although it was never moved, of eliciting the Papers which have given rise to this discussion. What I have said this evening I have said because I will not, even to the insignificant extent of personal abstention from discussion, share in the responsibility for the present unique system of military administration in India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00288"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was greatly struck yesterday, as was the noble Lord who has just sat down, with the remark which the noble Viscount the Secretary of State made in the opening of his speech. He declared that, while he had no fault to find with the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, for raising this question, he was at a loss to know what the noble Lord's object was in doing so. I have no clue to Lord Curzon's intentions beyond that supplied by the speech which he delivered yesterday, and from that speech I inferred that his object in raising this discussion was to challenge the policy of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India in regard to the Military Department of the Government of India, and to press for a reconsideration of that policy.<lb/>
There is no doubt that substantial changes in the Military Department of the Government of India were necessary, but I confess to great sympathy with those who regret that the changes have taken the direction which they have done. The question is not of such recent origin as some noble Lords who spoke yesterday were disposed to think. I might almost say, with accuracy, that it is coeval with the establishment of settled government in India. Settled government was established in India by the Regulating Act of 1773, which created the office of Governor-General and created his Council. That Act appointed the Commander-in-Chief in India to be an ordinary member of the Governor-General's Council. That was followed in 1784 by another Act, well known as "Pitt's Act," which reduced the Governor-General's Council by one member, but definitely prescribed that one of the three remaining members should always be the Commander-in-Chief in India. It will thus appear to your Lordships that in the commencement of our Indian administration the Commander-in-Chief of the
<col>78</col>
Indian forces was a member of the Governor-General's Council.<lb/>
But a revulsion of feeling soon ensued. In England amongst the Statesmen of that time the opinion grew up that it was undesirable that the Commander-in-Chief should be the military adviser of the Governor-General in Council, and, accordingly, in the Charter Act of 1793 the Commander-in-Chief was excluded from Council, although a discretion was left to the Court of Directors to appoint him a member of the Council if necessary. That was the policy which prevailed in England. But a different view of the functions of the Commander-in-Chief and of his utility as a military adviser prevailed in India and also in the Court of Directors, so that from the year of Pitt's Act in 1784 until the great Act re-establishing the Government of India on modern foundations&#x2014;namely, the Act of 1833&#x2014;the Commander-in-Chief was invariably a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council.<lb/>
I would advise those who say that it is impossible to conduct a great military administration while having the Commander-in-Chief as the Viceroy's adviser to reflect upon the history of India in that momentous period which covered the last quarter of the Eighteenth Century and the first thirty years of the Nineteenth Century. No period in the history of India is so full of military achievements grandly conceived and successfully carried out as that period. In the beginning of it you have the victories of Porto Novo, Wandewash, and Cudalore, which destroyed the French supremacy in the South. Then you have the victory of Seringapatam, which destroyed the power which had been built up by Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saheb. Then you come to the victories of Argaum and Assaye, which brought the name of Wellesley into notice, and which shook the Mahratta power, and finally you have the victory of Laswari and the victory of Bhurtpore, which completely destroyed it. Therefore, I do hold that it cannot be stated as absolutely and without qualification correct that military administration cannot be conducted while the Commander-in-Chief is not only the executive authority but also the administrative authority in military affairs.<lb/>
But it must be said that in those days the method of administering the Government of India and disposing of Indian affairs was
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0043"/>
<col>79</col>
entirely different from that which grew up at a later period. In those days you had action, and you had very little writing. To one to whom, like myself, it has fallen to examine the old records of the Government of India nothing is more remarkable than the succinctness with which the orders on the most important affairs are recorded. The fact was that the Governor-General and his Council sat together. There was no delegation of authority to the various members of Council. Every matter of importance was brought before the Council as a whole, was discussed across the table, and the orders then and there recorded. Some of the most important orders regarding war and peace were recorded on a sheet of notepaper of the ordinary size. But that method of administering business was not in accordance with the views which prevailed amongst English Statesmen. When the condition of India was most fully examined, as it was before the Charter Act of 1833 was passed, it became known that the orders which had been issued and frequently repeated in regard to the exclusion of the Commander-in-Chief from the administrative business of the Council had not been observed. Consequently in the Act of 1833 it was provided that, if any military officer was a member of the Governor-General's Council, he became thereby excluded from all military command in India. The effect of that was peremptorily to exclude the Commander-in-Chief from the direction of administrative business in the Governor-General's Council, and to introduce in his place a Military Member. But the influence of the Commander-in-Chief was so great and the benefit of his advice so manifest that power was given to the Court of Directors, if they so desired, to make the Commander-in-Chief an Extraordinary Member of the Council, and from that day to this the Commander-in-Chief has remained an Extraordinary Member of the Council, while the administrative military business of the Government of India has been conducted by a Military Member of Council.<lb/>
That change was introduced in the year 1833, and when again, after the Mutinies, the condition of India was carefully enquired into that same provision was repeated in the Indian Councils Act of 1861, so that, in accordance with the spirit of this legislation, it is impossible for a military officer holding the position of Military Member of Council also to hold any combatant charge
<col>80</col>
in India. I am well aware that when a member is appointed to the Governor-General's Council no particular work is allocated to him. He is merely appointed a Member of Council. Then the Viceroy, through the statutory powers which he exercises, allocates to each member the work which he desires him to perform. Of course, there is reason in things, and when a great soldier is appointed an Ordinary Member of Council he naturally is given military duties to discharge. When a lawyer is appointed to the Council he is given legal business. But it rests entirely with the Viceroy to allocate to any particular member of his Council the work which he desires him to perform.<lb/>
It may by some stretch of ingenuity be argued that the Extraordinary Member of Council is a member of the Council, and that it rests with the Viceroy to give to the Extraordinary Member any particular work which has to be discharged by the Council; but I venture, with all deference, to say that seeing that the object of the Act of 1833 was to exclude the Commander-in-Chief from the administration of military affairs in the Council, seeing that that exclusion was repeated in 1861, it would be in contradiction to the spirit of the Act if now by any Executive Order the Commander-in-Chief, an Extraordinary Member of the Council, is made, for the purposes in hand, an Ordinary Member, and if the practice which has been abrogated for seventy years is now again to be brought into operation. I respectfully submit that in appointing the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Kitchener, to perform duties which have hitherto been performed by the Military Member a strain has been put on the legislation which governs the Government of India which a reasonable and moderate interpretation of the Act will not confirm.<lb/>
But, my Lords, if that be the case, and if now your military administration in India is out of harmony with the law which should regulate it, is there no remedy, no means by which, except by an appeal to the Legislature, the difficulty can be overcome? I venture to say that if an appeal were made to your Lordships' House with the object of reversing the legislation of 1833 and 1861 and of making an extraordinary member as available for work in the Viceroy's Council as an ordinary member, your Lordships would not be disposed to regard it with much favour. But it seems to me that
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0044"/>
<col>81</col>
there is one way out of the difficulty by which the objects the Secretary of State and your Lordships have in view may be attained while at the same time regard and respect may be paid to the legislation on the Statute Book.<lb/>
The solution&#x2014;and this is a matter on which I do not express an opinion formed immediately but an opinion I have held for many years&#x2014;the solution of the military question in India in my opinion lies in the application to the Army of that same principle of decentralisation which, applied to the civil Government, has worked such marvellous wonders. If the Commander-in-Chief be regarded as a local Government; if the whole business of the Army be handed over to his control, as the whole business of civil administration in a local Government is handed over to a Governor or Lieut.-Governor; if the Commander-in-Chief, subject to the orders of the Government of India, is allowed to administer his own Budget, and if the only obligation imposed upon him is to give an account of his stewardship, as every local Government in India gives, you will effect, within the Constitution, that transfer of military control and command to the Commander-in-Chief which it is desirable he should have. That some such change is necesssary nobody more than I believes.<lb/>
I well remember a day in the early summer of 1897, when the province of which I was Lieut.-Governor was just emerging from a severe and protracted famine, and when the efforts of all the civil officers were directed to enabling and encouraging the people to cultivate their fields and sow their seed in the hope of a harvest. Their cattle were emaciated, as might be well understood after a protracted famine of eight months when no blade of grass was to be found. I was startled one day on hearing that the Military Department of the Government of India had sent out a number of soldiers to seize the plough cattle, impress them, and take them off to the frontier, where they were required to drag commissariat wagons into difficult country. Of course, these cattle were not suited for that work, and the only result was that the frontier was strewn with their bones. It then struck me as an extraordinary thing that the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, while capable of mobilising his troops and sending them off by rail to the rail head, was unable to move
<col>82</col>
them beyond rail head because the transport controlled by another Department was not ready. That was a striking example of the desirability of transferring from the Military Department to the Commander-in-Chief those branches of the military service which are necessary for effective action in the field.<lb/>
I have only one word more to say. It has been stated that the difficulty has been bridged over by appointing a Secretary to the Government of India in the Military Department in order to keep the Viceroy <i>au courant</i> with what happened in military affairs. I myself have been a Secretary to the Government of India, and I well remember the time when, on a very important matter, I took advantage of the power which I certainly possessed of going direct to the Viceroy without consulting the Member of Council. The result of it was a serious conflict between the Member of Council and the Viceroy, while I spent a bad quarter-hour. When I hear this suggestion made to supply the deficiency of the Military Member of Council, I appeal to my own experience of how these things are worked. When I knew the Military Department of the Government of India the junior ranks were a brood of young lions. Some of them have since become distinguished officers; some, unhappily, are no longer with us; but while they were waiting for their natural prey on the frontier they were perfectly willing to dispose of any number of Secretaries of the Government of India who attempted to interfere with them in military affairs. Either your Secretary will be a weak man and then the Viceroy will reap no benefit from him, or, if he is a strong man&#x2014;and circumstances in India do develop strength of character in every way&#x2014;he will become in reality, if not in name, a Military Member of Council, but without the responsibility. He will not in any case satisfactorily supply the loss of the Military Member of Council. I make these remarks, my Lords, not with any object of criticism or finding fault with the Secretary of State for India, but with the view of showing how the thoughts of other people have been running on this question, and how the matter might, in their opinion, have been solved without the heroic and, in my view, illegal measures which have been taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00289"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount who represents
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0045"/>
<col>83</col>
the India Office at the outset of his remarks expressed, unless I misunderstood him, a certain amount of surprise that anyone should think it worth his while to provoke a discussion upon the matters which have engaged our attention yesterday and to-day. I do not know whether the noble Viscount can seriously have supposed that events as important as these, that changes in the administration of the Indian Army as fundamental as those which he has required the Government of India to accept, should pass unchallenged and un-discussed in your Lordships' House. All I can say is that, in my humble opinion, your Lordships would have been guilty of something like a serious neglect of duty if we did not call attention to the Papers which have been presented, and to the important new departure for which His Majesty's Government are responsible. And I think my noble friend Lord Curzon would have been almost superhuman if he had refrained from recurring to the events of 1905, and from calling attention to the very striking fulfilment of some of the predictions in which he then indulged. Nor, I venture to think, should it be a matter for surprise that the members of the Government of 1905 should desire to say a few words, as my noble friend Lord Midleton did last night, as to the circumstances in which the memorable compromise of that year was brought about.<lb/>
I desire at the outset to say that I range myself alongside my noble friend Lord Midleton in thinking that it would have been altogether beyond the power of any Government to refuse at that time a full reconsideration of the system upon which the Indian Army was then administered. The circumstances were too strong for us. We had as Commander-in-Chief a General, celebrated not only as a great leader of troops, but celebrated as an Army administrator, and that distinguished General was not only a critic, but an irreconcilable critic of the system of Army administration which he found in existence when he went to India.<lb/>
Most of your Lordships are probably familiar with the historical Minute forwarded upon this subject by Lord Kitchener in 1905. I think it covers something like twenty-four pages of printed matter. Whether you agree with it or whether you do not, it is impossible for any one to pretend that it was not a weighty document
<col>84</col>
demanding the attention of the Government to whom it was addressed. On the other side we had the Despatch and the Minute of my noble friend Lord Curzon, written, like everything which he writes, with much persuasive power and dialectic skill, and we had the Minute of the Military Member of the Council, Sir Edmond Elles, a gallant officer of whom I wish to speak in the highest possible terms&#x2014;a Minute of the same length as that from the Commander-in-Chief. That was the problem with which the Government of 1905 was confronted, and to my noble friend Lord Midleton fell the extremely difficult and thankless task of endeavouring to find a way out of a position which had all the appearance of becoming a deadlock.<lb/>
My noble friend made one suggestion&#x2014;he mentioned it last night&#x2014;I think an admirable suggestion, the failure of which I shall always regret. He desired to put an end to all this lengthy correspondence by sending out to India a kind of Commission, the members of which might on the spot discuss in a friendly and unofficial manner the views of the two opposing sides, and who might have endeavoured on the spot to find a way out of the difficulty. I for one was sanguine that Lord George Hamilton, Lord Roberts, and Sir A. Godley would have succeeded in the endeavour, and I believe now that the tact and ability which enabled Lord George Hamilton to grapple with the intricacies of Poor Law administration in this country would have enabled him to find a reasonable solution of the difficulty; but, as your Lordships know, climatic reasons rendered Lord George Hamilton's visit to India impossible.<lb/>
Well, we fell back on another expedient&#x2014;we appointed a Consultative Committee, which included among its members men whose opinions on any Indian question were entitled to considerable weight, men of business capacity well known by all who have had to do with Indian affairs. It included two ex-Indian Commanders-in-Chief&#x2014;Lord Roberts and Sir George White&#x2014;Sir John Gordon, Sir Edward FitzGerald Law, and Sir James Mackay, a gentleman of unrivalled business experience, besides my two colleagues who sit behind me; the Committee, moreover, found the means of ascertaining authoritatively the views of Sir H. Brackenbury, of Sir E. Collen, of Sir David Barbour (ex-Finance Member of Council), of Lord
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0046"/>
<col>85</col>
Elgin (an ex-Viceroy), and of my noble friend Lord Cromer, who spoke last night. I mention this to show that any recommendation proceeding from such a Committee was entitled to our utmost consideration and respect. It is remarkable that the Committee was unanimous in favour of retaining in some shape or form a Military Member of the Council; that is a cardinal point, and on that point the Committee were unanimous. The scheme they proposed was concurred in by my noble friend Lord Roberts, who has throughout these discussions been a protagonist on the side of those who desired that besides the Commander-in-Chief there should be a member of the Viceroy's Council responsible for the administration of the Army.<lb/>
The noble Viscount suggested last night that I had myself indicated that the scheme adopted by His Majesty's Government on the recommendation of the Committee was one that might require reconsideration in regard to points of detail. He seemed to think that the change he is now making is a change of detail such as I had in mind. But if he will look at the context of my speech he will see quite clearly that in my view the kind of change I looked forward to was a change, not in the direction in which he has been travelling, but in an opposite direction, that of restoring to the Military Member some of the attributes of which he was then shorn. I do not know whether the noble Viscount's idea of a detail is the same as mine, but I cannot bring myself to regard it as appropriate to describe as a mere detail a step which simply means the summary "knocking on the head" of the Military Member as constituted on the recommendation of the Committee of 1905. That was not a point of detail, but the essence of the arrangement of 1905.<lb/>
I have never regarded the settlement of 1905 as an ideal settlement, certainly it was not an economical settlement; but after all it worked well, and it is beyond dispute that if the noble Viscount had left the Government of India to themselves they would have allowed that settlement to remain in operation for the present at any rate. Does the noble Viscount question that? It appears to me from the reading of the documents that have been laid on the Table that the Government of India, if the noble Viscount had left them to themselves,
<col>86</col>
would have preferred to keep in operation the compromise arrangement of 1905.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00291"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I altogether challenge that. I know the noble Viscount holds that view, but I do not think it is a view which is borne out by the documents. I will make my words good. In the Despatch of March, 1907, this is what the Government of India said&#x2014;
<quote>"We are, however, glad to report that the various measures which have been undertaken to ensure the smooth working of the new system have been completely successful, and that the business of Army administration, in all Departments, is now conducted with a singleness of purpose and a freedom from delay which is greatly to the advantage of the public service."</quote>
That was in March, 1907. Later on, in September, 1907, they said&#x2014;
<quote>"After giving this question our fullest consideration, we are agreed in respectfully but strongly deprecating the re-opening of the question of military administration in India at the present time, and only some eighteen months after the introduction of the new system";</quote>
and then comes the passage on which the noble Viscount relies&#x2014;the passage in which they point out that the reopening of the question might lead to a recrudescence of the discussion. But then follows the pronouncement of the year 1908. This is what they then said&#x2014;
<quote>"The experience gained since we wrote our Despatch of September, 1907, has not altered the views we then placed before your Lordship."</quote>
"Experience gained" of what? There is nothing there about recrudescence of the discussion. It is experience gained of the smooth working of the new system, the complete success in the administration of the Department concerned. Therefore, I think I am within the mark when I say that on the merits the Government of India, if the noble Viscount had not pressed them, would have allowed the arrangement of 1905 to remain in operation, at any rate for some time longer. Now the noble Viscount urges that owing to considerations of economy an end should be put to the 1905 arrangement&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00293"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to make light of the saving even of a lakh of rupees, but I do say without the slightest doubt that the new departure we are discussing this evening is a triumph, not of economy, but of centralisation. Upon the whole of these arrangements centralisation is writ large. My noble friend held in his hand yesterday the diagram showing the new distribution of duties under the Commander-in-Chief. Never in the history of Army administration has concentration so ruthless been put into execution as in this new system. Here you have a single man put in charge of the executive command of the Army, of the administration of a whole group of departments which used to be under the control of the Military Member, and you have this same man expected to act as the sole adviser of the Government of India on military questions, and also to take his part in the daily work of the Viceroy's Cabinet, aiding his colleagues in other questions unconnected with military matters.<lb/>
The noble Viscount last evening gave us an interesting digression on the subject of the burdens and responsibilities thrown on public men. He told us that everybody&#x2014;Ministers, the Governors of the Bank of England, and I think he mentioned one or two others&#x2014;all are overburdened, and so they are, no doubt. And he argued that the proper and obvious remedy was delegation, delegation of work to subordinates. Delegation is a very admirable thing, but delegation of routine work to subordinates is quite a different thing from decentralisation of responsibility as between great officials. The object of all military reforms in later years has been to bring about decentralisation, not only of work but of responsibility. The whole chain of military reforms, dating from the Hartington Commission and coming down to the more recent changes which resulted from the inquiries conducted under the presidency of Lord Esher&#x2014;all those changes have been in the direction of decentralisation, and, above all, of maintaining a clear distinction between the duties of those who are entrusted with executive command in the Army and those entrusted with the duty of Army administration.<lb/>
<col>88</col>
Look at what happened in this country. We had at one time an omnipotent or nearly omnipotent Commander-in-Chief. We began by clipping his wings and by transferring part of his powers and functions to those who had been his subordinates; and, finally, we got rid of the Commander-in-Chief altogether and broke up the work concentrated in his office amongst a number of separate Army departments; and while we are doing that at home and taking credit&#x2014;as the Secretary for War now and again takes credit&#x2014;for having carried out this work of decentralisation here at home, you are in India moving in an opposite direction and setting up a Commander-in-Chief who will unite in his own person the powers wielded by the Commander-in-Chief in the days of the Duke of Cambridge with the powers of the present Army Council and those of the Secretary of State for War. And, my Lords, is it not an instance of the irony of events that, at the very moment when you are piling up this colossal mountain of work on a single official, the man at whose instance all this is being done and who, if anybody could have been equal to the task would have been equal to it, leaves the scene, and you have to look among the less-known soldiers for an officer who shall himself do work which was enough, and more than enough, for such men as Lord Roberts, aided by such a man as Sir George Chesney, one of the most distinguished and laborious officials whom I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, and later by such a man as Sir Henry Brackenbury, a brilliant administrator, whose record at the War Office and in the Government of India stands second to none for its conspicuous ability.<lb/>
I know the noble Viscount desires to comfort us by telling us that, after all, this centralisation will not be so serious as we suppose. He says we have still got the Secretary to the Government of India in the Army Department and that we may rely upon him for independent advice. I think. I am right in saying that Lord Kitchener, in one of the papers with which we are familiar, describes the Secretary to the Government of India as the absolutely independent adviser of the Government of India. I am well aware of the peculiar position in which the Secretaries of the Government of India in the different departments stand. It is a position which has no analogue in our official arrangements in this country. It is a position of great indepen-

dence. The Secretary has access privately to the Viceroy and also the Governor-General in Council. But do not let the noble Viscount suppose that the Secretary to the Army Department under his new dispensation will be in that position of complete independence&#x2014;nothing of the kind. He will be a military officer. He will be a subordinate of the Commander-in-Chief. He will probably owe his appointment to the Commander-in-Chief or to a previous Commander-in-Chief.</membercontribution></p>

Well, my Lords, when a boa constrictor swallows a guinea-pig there is practical amalgamation of the snake and the victim, and I am afraid that the amalgamation in this case means the complete absorption of the Army Department in the purely military hierarchy of which the Commander-in-Chief will be the head; and, my Lords, when I express, as I do, my grave doubt as to the prospect of obtaining a really independent military opinion from any of these officials who will be under
<col>90</col>
the Commander-in-Chief, I am not expressing the view merely of a jaundiced and suspicious civilian. I will quote an authority whom no one is likely to gainsay on this question. In 1905 Lord Roberts, in this House, was meeting the suggestion that the Government of India would be able to get alternative military opinions and independent advice from military officers other than the Commander-in-Chief, and his comment was that these officers would be strictly subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief and could not express opinions to the Viceroy in opposition to those held by their immediate chief. Lord Roberts added&#x2014;
<quote>"To do so would be subversive of military discipline."</quote>
My noble friend Lord Midleton and I, who have been behind the scenes at the War Office, know how true those words are; but coming, as they do, from the lips of a man like Lord Roberts, I say they are irrefutable. This new arrangement will be what is vulgarly called a "one man show," and with the introduction of the new system there will disappear the last fragment of the arrangement based on what I conceive to be the only sound principle&#x2014;I mean the separation of the executive from the administrative work of the Army.<lb/>
I know we are told that so long as there are two members of Council connected with Army affairs, so long as what is often spoken of as the dual system prevails, you will have friction and over-lapping, and that there will be usurpation by the Military Department of the right to deal with purely military questions. That difficulties of that kind do arise, have arisen, and are likely to arise again, I do not deny; but I do believe they can be got over. Just as it was found possible, I think in the year 1889, to meet the views of my noble friend Lord Roberts when he asked for a reconsideration of the arrangements between the two offices, I believe the same kind of readjustment can with advantage take place from time to time and should produce the desired result. I confess, however, that I am very much inclined to discount these complaints of friction and usurpation. After all, are we quite sure when we talk about friction that we do not mean really this, that there are two sides to the question and that both sides have succeeded in getting a hearing? Of course, if you can so arrange matters that one side shall be snuffed out early in the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0049"/>
<col>91</col>
controversy there will be no friction and everything will go pleasantly and agreeably.<lb/>
Then, again, there is the complaint that the Military Department is inclined to poach on the preserves of the Commander-in-Chief and to attempt to deal with what people usually describe as purely military questions. Let me say at once that I should oppose any arrangement under which the Military Department was given any right of interfering with what I should call purely military questions; but surely it is the case, not only in India but everywhere, that questions arise which are not purely military questions but questions which have a financial and political side; this is particularly the case in India, where, even when a question is supposed to be a purely military question, you will find it has other aspects which require to be taken into consideration. And when you ask one man, and that a man who is entrusted with the whole discipline and training and command of the Army, to advise the Government of India, not only on the military aspects of the case properly so called, but also upon the political and financial aspects, I say you are putting too heavy a burden on the shoulders of a single man.<lb/>
My main fear is that in these new arrangements you are going to impair the usefulness of the Commander-in-Chief as head of the Indian Army. Your Lordships heard what Lord Cromer said as to the importance of dealing tenderly with that most delicate and important piece of machinery; your Lordships also heard the eloquent passage in which my noble friend behind me described the personal relation in which the Commander-in-Chief ought to stand to the Indian Army. I will not go over that ground again. It is enough to say that the Commander-in-Chief in India ought to stand and ought to appear to stand almost <i>in loco parentis</i> to the Indian Army. He should be known by that Army; he should, if possible, be not only respected but beloved by that Army; and in order that he may be so known and so beloved, it is necessary that he should be in constant personal touch with the Army, that he should travel about the country, that he should not appear to the soldiers under him a kind of remote official personality living high up among desks and despatch boxes at Simla, but that he should be constantly seen by them and able to travel
<col>92</col>
about over all parts of the Indian Empire from one frontier to another.<lb/>
The Commander-in-Chief in India has duties to perform which correspond to those of the Inspector-General of the British Army, with a great deal besides superadded. How can you expect any soldier, however able, however industrious, to do all these things, to stand in the position in which he ought to stand in the eyes of the people of India and the Army in India, and also to administer a whole group of public offices and to be the adviser of the Government of India on all great questions of military policy? How can he do all these things, and also be in a position, as I conceive he ought to be in a position, to take command in the field? The noble Viscount told us that no such thing had happened since 1857; but is he quite sure that such a thing will never happen again, and would it not be a bad thing if it got into the heads of the Indian Army that their Commander-in-Chief was not the man who would lead them when an emergency arose and they were called upon to take the field?<lb/>
I am afraid that the step which you are taking is indeed a step in the wrong direction. I believe you will have to move further, but you will have to move in a different direction. You will have to move again in the direction of separating the duties which you are now concentrating in the hands of a single officer. I am convinced that you will in the end have to go back to the arrangement under which there will be two officers&#x2014;one officer in charge of executive duties and one officer in charge of administration; one officer who will be, so to speak, an indoor officer, and another who will be an outdoor officer.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me suggested two alternative arrangements which he regarded as possible. While I think both are worthy of discussion, I should greatly regret any arrangement under which the Commander-in-Chief was no longer entitled to take part in the deliberations of the Viceroy's Council. By no longer making him a member of that Council you would greatly diminish his dignity and importance in the eyes of the Indian Army. But with that reservation I do not very much care what the new arrangement may be or what name you give to the two officers. What I care about is not the name, but the principle; and as
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0050"/>
<col>93</col>
far as the principle is concerned, I am deeply convinced that the new system which you are introducing is opposed to the views of all Army reformers; you are taking a step which in my view removes the last vestiges&#x2014;vestiges to which I, for one, cling with a good deal of attachment&#x2014;of what I conceive to be the only sound system on which you can administer the affairs of the Indian Army or indeed of any other army in the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00298"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member><membercontribution>:My Lords, during the short period that I have had the honour of a seat in your Lordships' House there is no member of it to whom I have listened with greater attention and admiration than the noble Marquess who has just sat down. I think that this evening he has accomplished a most difficult task and accomplished it with an amount of skill and acumen which every Member of the House must have perceived and envied.<lb/>
There were three compartments in the noble Marquess's speech. They did not agree with each other, and now that he has finished his able speech I do not really gather what the noble Marquess would have done if he had been Secretary of State for India during the whole of the crisis. The first part of the speech was, in my opinion, a complete justification of the attitude of the Conservative Secretary of State. Having defended the policy of Lord Midleton as opposed to the policy of Lord Curzon, the noble Marquess censured the present Government for having really done the same thing as Lord Midleton. The policy that we have carried out from first to last has been the policy of Lord Midleton. The whole of these difficulties, indeed, originated with noble Lords opposite. No proof has been given that the principle which my noble friend Lord Morley has carried out has failed; all the evidence is the other way. From the Viceroy, the Viceroy's Council, and every part of the public service in India which is concerned comes testimony to the success of the new policy.</membercontribution></p>

<col>94</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00301"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: If the new policy was so extraordinarily successful, why abolish the Department responsible for that success?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00302"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: The policy which my noble friend the Secretary of State has adopted, and to which we adhere, is the policy of getting rid of dual control in the administration of the Indian Army. The great evil Lord Lansdowne found in the system now in force in India is centralisation. I venture to submit to the House that this is a great scheme of decentralisation. The noble Lord spoke of the enormous work which will devolve on the Commander-in-Chief; but he omitted to refer to the complete change which has taken place in the organisation of the Indian Army. There are now ten separate Divisions. That is a great scheme of decentralisation. Large powers are entrusted to the ten Generals of Divisions. Such a fact cannot be left out of account in considering this subject.<lb/>
In 1906, when my noble friend took office, he was confronted by a scheme agreed upon in principle by the then Secretary of State and the Viceroy. He had to deal not with a new policy of his own, but with a policy of which the last Government had approved. He gave the scheme a fair trial, and without in any way interfering with its progress he watched it with the deepest interest. I believe his first intervention was in his Despatch of February 9, 1906, when he indicated several points which he thought open to criticism, and subject to conditions which were of some importance, but not of vital importance, he gave his approval to the scheme which had been prepared by the Government of India. I think they themselves suggested that a period of twelve or eighteen months should be allowed to see how the scheme worked. That was in 1906.<lb/>
In 1907 a Despatch was received from the Government of India, dated March 19, and signed by every Member of the Council. There are one or two paragraphs in that Despatch which have not been read to the House, and which I should like to quote. They wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"Our opinions with regard to Army administration in its relation to Military Finance have been so fully stated in our Despatch No. 10-M.F., dated February 7, 1907, that it is unnecessary
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0051"/>
<col>95</col>
to refer to them here. We are, however, glad to report that the various measures which have been undertaken to ensure the smooth working of the new system have been completely successful and that the business of Army administration, in all Departments, is now conducted with a singleness of purpose and a freedom from delay which is greatly to the advantage of the public service. Under the present constitution of Army administration, all important measures are discussed either in the Advisory Council, or in the Mobilisation or Defence Committee, and all proposals emanating from Army Headquarters requiring Government sanction&#x2014;except those of a routine or trifling nature&#x2014;have first to receive the Commander-in-Chief's executive approval, and have then to obtain the administrative concurrence of the Army Member, through the Army Secretary&#x2014;</quote>
the official who, the noble Marquess thought, would have too much power and too much influence&#x2014;
<quote>"The Secretary is consequently in complete touch with the work of the Department and acquainted with the progress of all its cases, and the Viceroy is kept fully informed of all measures undertaken in the administration of the Army, by the Secretary of the Department concerned, who is able to bring any important matter to His Excellency's immediate notice at any stage from initiation to completion.</quote>
<quote>"We recognise that finality in military administration is difficult of attainment and that it may be necessary to make some modifications in the details of the system now in force, in order to simplify its organisation and reduce its cost; but we have much satisfaction in being able to report that the important changes ordered in your Despatch, No. 18 (Military), dated February 9, 1906, have been productive of excellent results, and that, thanks to the harmonious co-operation of all concerned, they have fulfilled the intentions of His Majesty's Government, and justified the anticipations expressed in the concluding paragraphs of your Despatch."</quote>
My noble friend's next step was to ask for further information as to how the system was working out, both in regard to efficiency and cost. I will not trouble your Lordships with the various points bearing on this question on which he asked for full information; but in their reply to the Secretary of State the Government of India wrote on September, 26, 1907&#x2014;
<quote>"We have received and considered in Council, your Despatch. Military, No. 105, dated June 28, 1907, in which you propose, for our consideration, the abolition of the Military Supply Department, its work being taken over by the Army Department, and the consequent reduction of the representation of the Army in the Council of the Governor-General of India. After giving this question our fullest consideration we are agreed in respectfully but strongly deprecating the reopening of the question of Military Administration in India at the present time, and only some eighteen months after the introduction of the new system, when, if the proposed change should be accepted,
<col>96</col>
we cannot but apprehend a recrudescence of heated and acrimonious public discussion which in the interests of the Army and the Government of India generally it is most desirable to avoid."</quote>
They then dealt with my noble friend's specific questions, which they answered in detail; and they added&#x2014;
<quote>"So far as our experience goes&#x2014;</quote>
this is, the eighteen months experience&#x2014;
<quote>"So far as our experience goes of the working of the Army Department, it tends to show it has been fully able to grapple with all the work with which it has had to deal. There is no congestion in either the office of the Secretary of the Army Department, or that of the Chief of the Staff. This compares most favourably with the condition of affairs that existed in the offices of the Commander-in-Chief, and in the Secretariat of the late Military Department of the Government of India before the abolition of the latter. All arrears have been disposed of, while the current work both in the Army Department Secretariat and in Army Headquarters is well up to date, and is dealt with as it arises. After giving the matter our fullest consideration, although we are, as stated in paragraph 2, unanimous in deprecating the raising now of the question of carrying out the suggested reform, we are agreed that the proposal is administratively and economically based on sound arguments and will have to be dealt with sooner or later."</quote>
That is the verdict of the whole of the Council of the Viceroy. My noble friend behind me was prepared to face what might have been a heated controversy, but I have noticed no sign of heat throughout this debate.<lb/>
The question of centralisation in the Military Department is not a new question. Lord Lytton, writing as Governor-General in 1880, with a greater experience of war on a large scale than any of the Governors-General who have followed him, fully supported the Commission in their desire for change, but stated very forcibly his reasons for thinking that change should take the shape of excluding the officer in charge of the Military Department from Council, and not the Commander-in-Chief. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I cannot too emphatically record my conviction that the dual military Government organised in this country 'on a system of want of trust' should be abolished as speedily and completely as possible &#x2026; My conclusion is that the Commander-in-Chief should be himself the Military Member, <i>and the only Military Member</i> of the Viceroy's Council. In him alone, as in the War Minister of every country not governed by Parliamentary institutions, should be united and concentrated the executive command and the administrative control of the Army."</quote>

The same views were expressed by Lord Dalhousie and by Lord Dufferin.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00303"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Lord Dufferin's view was quite the opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00304"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: I am quite content to leave it at Lord Dalhousie and Lord Lytton. I do not quite understand what the noble Marquess opposite proposes that the Government should do. He has not told us that. Lord Curzon made a very adroit and successful conclusion to his speech last night in which he pointed out two courses that might be taken, but I did not understand him to favour either of them; and the one that seemed to be more in accord with the views he expressed in his speech he stated was not really his own. He did not give it the sanction of his own authority to any extent. My noble friend behind me, Lord MacDonnell, gave us an interesting account of the history of the position of the Commander-in-Chief in the Indian Council, but I do not agree with him as to the date at which he began. He should have commenced at the year 1858. Any attempt to raise an argument as to what was done when India was under the Government of the East India Company does not seem to me to be relevant. I venture to submit to the House that the great principles of reform in the administration of our Imperial Army at home, which are being carried out by the Secretary of State for War, Lord Morley is to a very great extent carrying out in India. It is the policy of decentralisation, of entrusting the people who have the administration with the necessary power to carry it out, subject always to the Commander-in-Chief. Government cannot be carried on without devolution, and the Commander-in-Chief in India will do as Ministers in this country do in devolving duties upon competent deputies.<lb/>
Under the new system in India financial control, which did not exist before, has been secured, and is working most satisfactorily. Lord Lansdowne has not made any recommendation that the Government should do anything. The best course that can be taken is to let the scheme work on, and we shall find, no doubt, in the course of events that there will be improvements in matters of detail which will commend themselves to successive Secretaries of State and also to successive military authorities.<lb/>
I have the greatest respect for Lord Curzon and the greatest admiration for his
<col>98</col>
Viceroyalty; but the noble Lord has never recognised, and I fear will not recognise tonight, what really is meant by Parliamentary control of the Government of India. The official whom the noble Lord regards as supreme in India is not the Secretary of State, but the Viceroy. That fundamental difficulty runs through all the noble Lord's Correspondence and Despatches. He is not satisfied with the position of the Viceroy in relation to the Secretary of State. Parliamentary control is the safeguard for the real difficulties which may arise; and if they do arise the Secretary of State is the proper and legitimate authority to deal with them. There is no issue before the House&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

Of course there will be no objection to submit Papers to your Lordships. If by a change in the political world noble Lords opposite found themselves responsible for the government of India I would be very much surprised if they made any change in the policy of my noble friend the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00307"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is quite true in one sense that there is no issue before the House. The Motion was placed on the Paper for the very practical purpose of obtaining information as to whether the Government are deliberately going to pursue the policy of conducting the military administration of India with one officer, who is to be both Commander-in-Chief and Minister for War. To that policy we now understand that His Majesty's Ministers have pinned their adhesion. When the noble Viscount asks, "What is your alternative policy? What is the particular scheme which you recommend?" he is putting a question which ought at no time to be put to any politician in Opposition, and ought least of all to be addressed to me. It is true that I indicated in my speech views which I had considered, but it will not be for me to carry them out, and I can imagine nothing more likely to expose me to the rebuke of the noble Viscount opposite than that I, in a position of irresponsibility,, should venture on the course which he has suggested.<lb/>
In his concluding remarks, the noble Viscount attributed to me a scheme of political
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0053"/>
<col>99</col>
philosophy which I entirely repudiate&#x2014;namely, that my view of the Government of India was that it should be conducted in independence and repudiation of the proper supremacy of Parliament and of the Secretary of State. The subject is irrelevant to this debate, but I can truthfully say that I do not think any utterance of mine bears out that impression. What I contended for in 1905, and what I contend now, is that the supremacy conceded by statute&#x2014;namely, the Charter Act of 1833&#x2014;to the Government of India over all military affairs in India should be kept intact, and it is because I fear that the supremacy of the Governor-General in Council over military affairs in India must be impaired under the new system that I have steadily protested, and will continue to protest, against it.<lb/>
Mention has been made of Lord Lytton, who is the solitary Viceroy whose words can be quoted in support of the new system. Everybody knows why Lord Lytton made his proposal. It was at the time of the Afghan war, and Lord Lytton wished that the Commander-in-Chief in India should be detained at headquarters in order that the illustrious Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts, should conduct the campaign, and he also desired, in my view most mistakenly, to constitute his own private secretary, Sir George Colley, military adviser to himself. It was for these reasons that he proposed the abolition of the Military Member, though he realised the necessity of putting a civilian in his place. But when the authority of Lord Lytton is quoted, may I remind the noble Viscount that a succession of Viceroys&#x2014;Lord Northbrook, Lord Ripon, Lord Dufferin, Lord Lansdowne, Lord Elgin, and Lord Ampthill &#x2014;have taken a contrary view. During the last fifty years there has been only one Governor-General in India who has taken anything approaching the view which I understand is now adopted by His Majesty's Ministers. When the noble Viscount quoted an account of the new administration in India, of its wonderful success, and of the satisfaction of the Government of India, I could not help asking myself why any change had been introduced. As I read the Despatches, the confidence and satisfaction expressed by the Government of India were in the administration set up by Lord Midleton, but that is the system which the noble Viscount has now destroyed. There have, in fact, been three systems. There was the old system of what is sometimes called dual
<col>100</col>
control. That was abolished by the late Government. Then there was the system introduced by Lord Midleton. With that the Government of India were entirely satisfied.</membercontribution></p>

<col>101</col>
abolished at once. However, I do not wish to pursue that. As I have said, there have been three systems in India&#x2014;the old system which existed in my day, the new system introduced by Lord Midleton, and the third system which is now going to be set up. It is the last system which is regarded with so much suspicion on this side of the House, and against which the whole weight of authority is cast. The noble Viscount says that there has been great decentralisation, and that the General officers of the nine Divisions have been given all sorts of powers they never enjoyed before. I wonder if the noble Viscount is aware of the full extent, or rather of the very limited extent, of the powers conferred on them. And when he talks about the wonderful smoothness with which everything goes on at headquarters, and of the total lack of congestion, all I can say is that the whole of the information from India at my disposal absolutely contradicts that. I believe there is already, and that there must be still more in the future, a great congestion of business at headquarters, and that before this new scheme has been long in operation the centralisation caused by it will be of so overwhelming a character that even by itself it must demand some change.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00316"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: That is all contradicted by Lord Minto in his speech to Council the other day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00317"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I concur with the noble Viscount behind me (Lord Midleton) that it was a great misfortune that the resources of personal intercourse which he suggested were not available to us when this matter came on in 1905, but still more do I regret that it was not open to me to have that personal intercourse and conversation with himself. His speech last night made it evident to me, what I have often suspected before, that in reality he was not thoroughly acquainted with the manner and method of our military administration in India. There were several things he then said so widely divorced from the position as I knew it that I now realise how unfortunate it was we could not talk over matters together. For instance, when the noble Viscount says that the Commander-in-Chief was in the habit of being overruled by decisions in India which, in nine cases out of ten, were not the decisions of the Viceroy and his Council but of the Military Member himself, he represented a condition of affairs which I can well understand might
<col>102</col>
be regarded as a great grievance, but which I can assure him is totally divorced from the facts.<lb/>
When I left India, I had the figures collected, and these showed that from December, 1902, to June, 1905, 1,560 proposals emanating from the Commander-in-Chief had reached the Government of India, in the old Military Department. Of these, 1,260 had been accepted&#x2014;a proportion, I venture to think, unprecedented in the history of any previous Commander-in-Chief. Of the remainder, 178 were then under consideration, and 122 only had been refused. Of these 122, eleven were refused after discussion by the Viceroy and his colleagues in Council, fifteen were refused on financial grounds by the Financial and Military Departments in combination, and ninety-six only were refused by the Military Department, and they were cases of the most trivial description. It was impossible for the Military Department to overrule the Commander-in-Chief in any serious cases, because the moment the Papers containing the refusal came, all the Commander-in-Chief had to do was to ask that they should go to the Viceroy or should be taken before the Council. The Commander-in-Chief had the remedy in his own hands, and yet I can assure the noble Viscount that not once during the two or three years I had the honour of serving with Lord Kitchener did he ask that a single matter that had been decided against him should be brought before the Council.<lb/>
There was one other point in Viscount Midleton's speech to which I must refer because it is a point on which I feel rather sore. He told us last night that he had not been in a position to give to the public the Memoranda of Lord Elgin, Lord Cromer, Sir Henry Brackenbury, Sir David Barbour, and Sir E. Collen, whom he consulted for the assistance of his Committee, because they were private documents. If that were so&#x2014;and I do not desire to dispute it&#x2014;then the noble Viscount had no right to quote them in the Report which he laid before Parliament. That evidence was referred to, and what we felt so badly in India was that, while every shred of evidence that could tell against our case appeared to be scraped together by the noble Viscount in his Despatch, the evidence of all those statesmen to whom I have referred, which I happen to know was in favour of the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0055"/>
<col>103</col>
view of the Government of India, was withheld.<lb/>
One other observation on a <i>quasi</i>-personal point. The noble Viscount opposite yesterday rebuked me, not, I think, for the first time, in rather lofty tones, for what he described, and I think rightly described, as the unedifying controversy of 1905. I should like, in a sentence, to state the facts. I do not think the noble Viscount, or any noble Lord, could find anything to complain of in the Minutes and the Despatches that were laid before Parliament. I do not think they will find in them the slightest deviation from the becomingly high level of propriety and restraint that should characterise public communications of that description. As regards the controversy which was published in the newspapers in India and in this country, not as a Parliamentary Paper, I desire to say now, what I have never had an opportunity of saying before, that those papers were published against my wish and in spite of my protest, and only because they were pressed for by Lord Kitchener himself.<lb/>
The Secretary of State last night quoted a passage in my Minute and then asked me whether I did hold that the constitutional authority of the Government of India was impaired, and whether I did still believe that a military autocracy had been set up. My answer to that question is unhesitatingly in the affirmative. I know the Statute has not been repealed, and that theoretically the control of military matters by the Governor-General in Council stands exactly where it was. But, when you have all opposition eliminated at the earlier stages by processes which render military criticism in the military hierarchy of India absolutely impossible, and in the last resort, when matters come before Council, there is no one to advise the Viceroy and his colleagues except the Commander-in-Chief, who is himself the author of the proposals under discussion, then I say that a military autocracy does exist. I do not see how any one can dispute it, and, if it be disputed, let me ask is it a system which you would dare to set up in this country? I venture to say that the Ministry that introduced such a change would not have a six months existence.<lb/>
I am always reluctant to quote from
<col>104</col>
others, but there is one quotation to which I hope the noble Viscount will forgive me if I attach great importance, because it is from a speech which was made by the Right Hon. John Morley in October, 1905, at Arbroath. That was shortly after I had resigned, and the noble Viscount took a view of my position and the action of the late Government then very different from that which, I imagine, lie entertains now. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Lord Curzon has been chased out of power by the military, and the Secretary of State&#x2014;</quote>
that was Viscount Midleton&#x2014;
<quote>"has sanctioned that operation. If there is one principle more than another which has been accepted in this country since the day when Charles I lost his head, it is this&#x2014;that the civil power shall be supreme over the military power. That is what you will find in the India Office&#x2014;they have been guilty&#x2014;</quote>
that was Viscount Midleton&#x2014;
<quote>"of this great dereliction, this great departure from these standard maxims of public administration which have been practically sacred in this island ever since the days of the Civil War."</quote>
Last night the Secretary of State accused me of having somewhere used rather sonorous language. Surely, if my language was sonorous, his was flamboyant. Yet that is the great departure, the great dereliction, which the Secretary of State has now ratified and condoned.<lb/>
The Secretary of State seems to have felt some surprise as to the object of this debate. I think we may legitimately feel some surprise as to the character and progress of the debate. In the two speeches delivered from the Benches opposite has there been the slightest attempt made to meet the main current of the argument directed against them from this side of the House? Has any attempt whatever been made to take the point on which Lord Cromer laid so much stress&#x2014;namely, what may be described as the political argument as distinguished from the argument in relation to efficiency? Has any attempt been made to consider the effect that this change must have on the Native Army? Has any attempt been made to show how the Commander-in-Chief is going, under the new conditions, to fulfil his task? All we are told is that we need not be alarmed because in this country all the Departments are very much overworked, but no answer has been made to the question: How can
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0056"/>
<col>105</col>
one man discharge the double burden of Secretary of State and Commander-in-Chief?<lb/>
If I were asked what was the practical object of this debate I would answer in these words: It is to call attention to the fact that a system of military administration which was universally condemned by the colleagues of the right hon. gentleman in 1905, which would not be tolerated in this country, and which finds no parallel in any other country, is now being set up in India. Is it possible that the long list of Viceroys whom I have named&#x2014;Lords Northbrook, Ripon, Dufferin, Lansdowne, Elgin, and Ampthill&#x2014;the only two living ex-Commanders-in-Chief&#x2014;Lord Roberts and Sir George White&#x2014;statesmen like Lord Cromer, and great Indian soldiers like Sir Henry Brackenbury and Sir Edwin Collen, distinguished Indian civilians like Sir John Strachey, Sir Alfred Lyall, and Lord MacDonnell&#x2014;is it possible for them all to be absolutely wrong? Are all these men who have illumined Indian history by their services during the past fifty years entirely wrong, and is the only person who is right the present Commander-in-Chief?<lb/>
The noble Viscount said yesterday that I was flogging a dead horse. I can assure him that nothing would be more pleasing to me than never to say one word more about this question. It has soured and beclouded some of the best years of my
<col>106</col>
life. I wish I could put it away from me for ever. But I do not believe that the horse is dead. I am perfectly certain that in a few years time you will find that it is alive again. The fear I have is that if you leave things as they are now, at some date which we cannot anticipate, and which may be a date most inconvenient and most dangerous for us, the horse which is now supposed to be dead may rise and may unseat its rider. I have no desire to persist in my Motion for Papers, but I am grateful to the House for the opportunity it has given me of making these observations.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MERCANTILE MARINE&#x2014;EYE-SIGHT TESTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00346"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose "to call attention to the colour-vision test to which candidates for Board of Trade certificates as master or mate are subjected; to ask whether the attention of the President of the Board of Trade has been called to the case of Mr. W. H. Glover, who has been certified by the London Local Marine Board, after hearing expert evidence, as fit to discharge the duties of first mate, notwithstanding the fact that three persons who had tested his sight on behalf of the Board of Trade had failed Mr. Glover on the ground that he was defective in colour-vision, and therefore incompetent; whether the Board of Trade propose to take any further action in this matter, and whether they will state in how many cases within recent times have candidates for the Higher Grade Board of Trade Certificates, who have already passed the colour-vision test, been rejected on the ground of colour blindness when re-examined on application for a certificate of a higher grade; and also to call attention to the case of Mr. Trattles, who after having passed for first mate in colour tests, as well as for other qualifications, and having received the examiner's authority for the delivery of a first mate's certificate in 1906, received a letter stating that his examination had been cancelled as he had failed to pass a special colour examination in 1905; and to move that a Select Committee be appointed to consider the conditions under which eyesight tests for the Mercantile Marine certificates are conducted."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00347">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am bringing to your notice a most urgent and important matter. I say this because it is not only closely identified with the safety of life at sea, but under present
<col>110</col>
conditions it seems evident that very grave injustices may be perpetrated upon those who serve in the mercantile marine, either as officers or as candidates aspiring to become officers. I am referring to the examinations in colour-vision which candidates for Board of Trade certificates as master or mate are required to undergo. For your Lordships' information I will state in a few words the procedure which is followed in the case of candidates for these certificates. On filling up the necessary form and paying the sum of 1<i>s</i>., any person serving or intending to serve in the mercantile marine may present himself voluntarily for the examination. But, as I have said, in the case of candidates for certificates the examination is compulsory. It is with these candidates alone that I propose to deal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00348">In the first place, the candidate is examined by an examiner, the examination being conducted by the official Board of Trade examiners at the different seaports. If the candidate fails in the colour-test he may appeal to the Board of Trade, who, if they think fit, may submit the case to a special examiner or body of examiners for a final decision. If, on appeal, the candidate again fails, he must pay his own expenses, but if he succeeds they are under certain circumstances borne by the Board of Trade. When the candidate fails on appeal, and there is reason to believe that, in consequence, he is, through incompetency in regard to eyesight, unfit to discharge his duties, the Board of Trade, in the public interest, may cause an Inquiry to be held before a Court having jurisdiction to cancel or suspend such certificate. That is, of course, providing the candidate already has one or more certificates. Your Lordships will, therefore, see that the result of such an Inquiry, when set on foot by the Board of Trade, has two issues only; one is that it may mean the cancellation of an officer's certificate&#x2014;that is, if he has already passed the test when a candidate for a certificate of a lower grade. The unfortunate officer's professional career may be ruined, whilst the most valuable years of his life may prove to have been absolutely wasted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00349">The case of Mr. Glover, which I refer to in my Notice, has excited widespread attention, and a considerable amount of public controversy has arisen over it. The Imperial Merchant Service Guild,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0059"/>
<col>111</col>
which represent so many captains and officers, have laid certain facts before me in connection with this and other instances, and have expressed their alarm at the many injustices for which the existing mode of testing candidates in colour-vision may be held responsible. The <i>Shipping Gazette</i>, our leading shipping paper, has dwelt in the most emphatic terms on the enormity of Mr. Glover's case and of another case which I will bring to your notice, and has gone to much trouble in eliciting striking and significant facts which bear upon these cases. The <i>Journal of Commerce</i>, another well-known shipping paper, also identifies itself with this question, and without doubt there is a consensus of opinion that it demands the prompt attention of the Board of Trade.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00350">To put Mr. Glover's case shortly, in the first place he was failed in colour-vision by a Board of Trade examiner. On appeal he was examined by an expert examiner specially appointed by the Board of Trade, and again failed. The Board of Trade then caused a Local Marine Board Inquiry to be set on foot in order that Mr. Glover should be adjudged incompetent through defective colour-vision. Those who had examined Mr. Glover on behalf of the Board of Trade gave evidence to the effect that Mr. Glover was undoubtedly colour-blind. But that well-known specialist, Dr. William Ettles, pathologist to the Royal Eye Hospital, was called by Mr. Glover to give evidence on his behalf. Dr. Ettles stated that, from the point of visional power, Mr. Glover was fully qualified to undertake any position in the mercantile marine. He stated that Mr. Glover accurately matched colours every time without hesitation, and in the doctor's opinion a good many of the Board of Trade examinations were wrong. This, as your Lordships will observe, was a case of experts falling out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00351">The Board of Inquiry which heard the case considered that the best way out of the quandary was to test Mr. Glover for themselves. The result of it was that the Board found that he was not incompetent by reason of colour-blindness to perform his duties, and his certificate was therefore returned to him and the sum of ten guineas awarded as costs. Whether the London Local Marine Board is a competent tribunal to decide on a colour-vision test when experts differ
<col>112</col>
so absolutely is a matter of opinion. In any case, it will be patent to your Lordships that the position as it stands is untenable and at present we can have no confidence in these examinations. It would be a most dangerous thing if, by chance, a colour-blind officer were allowed to go to sea and be in charge of a ship; whilst, on the other hand, it is a grave injustice to a man if he is failed in colour-vision when his eyesight is not defective in this respect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00352">Besides this case of Mr. Glover, another of a most extraordinary character has been brought to my notice. It concerns an officer of the name of Trattles. In the year 1904 Mr. Trattles was passed in colours on going up for his second mate's certificate at West Hartlepool. I had better read to your Lordships Mr. Trattles' statement. It is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"On February 3, 1904, passed in colours before Captain Young at West Hartlepool. Remainder of second mate's examination the two following days before Captain Forrest, who gave me an unofficial examination in colours. On July 6, 1905, sat for chief mate and was failed in colours by Captain Forrest. Appealed to the Board of Trade against his decision and was examined at South Kensington by Captain Harvey, who upheld Captain Forrest's decision. Received a letter two days later asking me to surrender my second mate's ticket, which I refused. Got examined at the Central London Ophthalmic Hospital, also at the South London Royal Eye Infirmary, and received certificates from both stating that my colour sense was good."</quote>
I would ask your Lordships to note what follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Shortly after received a request from the Board of Trade to deliver up my certificate together with a statement that I surrendered it voluntarily, or, in the event of my not doing so, the Board of Trade would feel compelled to hold an Inquiry into my competency to hold a ticket&#x2014;</quote>
They often use the word "ticket" instead of "certificate"&#x2014;
<quote>"I answered demanding an Inquiry, and asking for it to be held in London at an early date. On September 1, 1905, an Inquiry was held in London, where I was given an examination before the Board and was informed that, so far as colour-vision was concerned, I was competent to hold a certificate. On April 27, 1906, again presented myself to be examined for first mate's certificate and was examined in colours and passed before Captain Saul, London. On May 7, 8, and 9, 1906, sat for the remainder of the examination and received examiner's authority for the delivery of a first mate's ticket, which I still hold. On May 17, 1906, received letter stating that my examina-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0060"/>
<col>113</col>
tion had been cancelled and that I had been improperly allowed to sit, having failed to pass the special colour examination on July 18, 1905."</quote>
I understand that the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen, who issues the certificates, said that it had been decided to withhold this certificate on the ground that Mr. Trattles was completely "red-blind," and Mr. Lloyd-George, who was then President of the Board of Trade and was appealed to in the hope that he would reverse the arbitrary decision of the Registrar-General, stated, in reply, that it had been found that Mr. Trattles was "green-blind." It is therefore palpable that either great injustices have been done or the present eyesight tests are total failures; and I would point out that the great proportion of candidates who are failed in colour-vision do not avail themselves of the opportunity they have for appealing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00353">At the Colonial Merchant Shipping Conference a resolution was adopted calling upon the Board of Trade to institute more severe examinations in connection with eyesight&#x2014;that is, both for form-vision and colour-vision. But it is not the severity of the examinations so much as the mode in which they are conducted which needs adjusting. I understand, and I believe it is a fact, that the question has been under the consideration of the late Advisory Committee of the Board of Trade acting on the initiative of the Board of Trade itself. What their views were on the situation I do not know. There was an amount of secrecy about the proceedings of the Board of Trade Advisory Committee which seemed to be quite unnecessary. The present forms of eyesight tests are based upon the report of a Committee on Colour-Vision appointed by the Council of the Royal Society. The Chairman of this Committee was Lord Rayleigh, and others upon the Committee were the late Lord Kelvin, Professor Foster, Mr. Francis Galton, Sir George Stokes, and Sir William Abney. One is inclined to question, therefore, the inefficiency of the present examinations. The mode of conducting them, however, is quite a different matter, and one for which the Committee I have referred to is not to be held responsible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00354">Since these experiences that I have mentioned of Mr. Trattles and Mr. Glover they have both been re-examined in colour-
<col>114</col>
vision at the instance of the Board of Trade&#x2014;on May 28 last&#x2014;and they have both been failed. Dr. Ettles, who had examined them and stated that, as far as their professional duties required, they were perfectly competent from the point of colour-vision, was invited by the Board of Trade to be present on the occasion of the examination. They said they would welcome his presence at the examination. I wrote to Dr. Ettles asking him what he thought of the examination, and whether he was satisfied with it. At this time neither of us had learned the result of the examination. I hold in my hand his reply, which is most interesting and instructive, but is too long to read to your Lordships. I will, however, give you one or two extracts from it. I may say that Dr. Ettles does not appear to have been very courteously treated at this examination, and he certainly does not think that the examination was fairly conducted in the interests of the candidates. On the contrary, it would appear as if conducted with the object of proving that the former adverse decisions were correct. I also understand that the examiners were those who had already conducted previous examinations of these gentlemen and had failed them, and surely they could not be expected to contradict themselves on this special examination when they were practically sitting on an appeal from their former decision, and I do not think that it was at all fair that they should have been the examiners on this occasion. Dr. Ettles states&#x2014;
<quote>"It is with regret that I am constrained to say that, in my opinion, it [the examination] was conducted on quite wrong principles."</quote>
After referring to the invitation that had been sent to him from the Marine Department of the Board of Trade, Dr. Ettles proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"On my arrival I was ushered into a room containing a considerable number of gentlemen, among whom I recognised one or two ophthalmic surgeons. I then asked Sir William Abney if he desired to consult with me as to the order and character of the tests, but this he declined to do, adding that I was free to look on if I chose. This was an unfortunate attitude, I think, because obviously if one or both of the candidates failed under conditions which I had accepted as adequate, the matter would have been at an end."</quote>
Then Dr. Ettles describes how the first candidate, Mr. Trattles, was taken in hand and the various tests adopted. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"He was not asked to match the wool, the only correct test with wools, but to pick out all the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0061"/>
<col>115</col>
greens. The poor man was in a pitiable state of nervousness, but no one would give him the smallest assistance. The proper attitude of the examiner is thus given by Adams Frost in Juler's 'Ophthalmic Science and Practice' [3rd edition, 1904, p. 356]: 'With people of low intelligence, and with children, it is a good plan for the examiner to go through the test himself to show how simple a matter it is; if the number of wools is sufficient, and they are properly mixed afterwards, this gives no unfair assistance to those whose colour-vision is defective.' Captain Harvey, who conducted the examination, evidently held no such view with regard to nervous examinees."</quote>
Then Dr. Ettles goes on to state the colours which Mr. Trattles picked out. Further on he says&#x2014;
<quote>"He was next given a deep rose pink, a more saturated colour than that described by Holmgren. He correctly drew out seven correct rose pinks and then 'went to pieces,' for the next two were a violet and a vermilion. He had been examined under great tension for ten minutes. A man with weak colour-vision will match a violet with a pink but not a vermilion. The red-blind chooses blue and violet: the green-blind a grey or a bright green. Trattles' match with pale green showed that he was not red-blind, while his match with pink showed he was not green-blind. The simultaneous production of violet and scarlet at the end of a succession of correct wools simply showed that the nervous tension was too much and his judgment had broken down."</quote>
Dr. Ettles continues&#x2014;
<quote>"The third test was a violet. Test III of the wool of Holmgren is a bright red. It was clear that the official order was not to be observed."</quote>
He goes on to speak of the tests, and then proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"Sir William Abney asked the names of colours while a sliding spectrum was being exhibited, so that several times when the answers came a new pair of tints was on the screen. I do not allege that this was in any way intentional, but it was careless of the candidate's interest. Another surprising point was the absence of method. The colours were shown haphazard and it would be impossible to analyse a defect by these means."</quote>
And towards the end Dr. Ettles says&#x2014;
<quote>"The memory of these examinations is unpleasant because there is an ineradicable conviction in my mind that the whole focal point was to prove the infallibility of the Board of Trade, and not to sift the case of these men whose whole future was at stake."</quote>
As I have said before, my Lords, it is not so much the form of the test that is objected to as the way in which it is sometimes conducted; and surely if, as Dr. Ettles says in the case of Mr. Trattles, he was in a pitiable state of nervousness, the attitude that Dr. Ettles describes was shown to him by the examiners was not likely to reduce that
<col>116</col>
state of nervousness, and, as Dr. Ettles quotes, not the proper attitude as described by authorities of ophthalmic science and practice. I do not for one minute say that Mr. Trattles is unintelligent; he certainly could not have passed the other portion of his examinations satisfactorily if he were; but a pitiable state of nervousness and the attitude shown to him might have reduced him nearly to the condition of a person of no intelligence on the occasion of the examination.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00355">Now, my Lords, there is one other test which Mr. Trattles has undergone, and I think your Lordships will agree with me that it is a most excellent test, and one to be thoroughly relied upon. I myself attach more importance to it than the tests of any scientists. I must tell your Lordships that all these years Mr. Trattles has been doing his duty as second mate. After the first question about his sight arose in 1905, naturally it was heard of by the captain under whom he was serving. No captain in his senses would trust his ship to the care of an officer about whose sight there was any doubt, and therefore this captain, without Mr. Trattles' knowledge, tested him in various ways and told Mr. Trattles afterwards he had done so. Apparently he was perfectly satisfied as to Mr. Trattles' colour-vision, as this letter, dated the 21st of this month, will show&#x2014;
<quote>"We have pleasure in stating that Mr. John Trattles has been second officer of our s.s. "Kingfield," 5,500 tons burden, from September, 1905, to May, 1909, during which time his conduct and ability have been all we could desire, and had he been eligible we should have promoted him to chief officer, as vacancies occurred. We have frequently questioned the captain as to his visual powers, and on every occasion the former has assured us that he has perfect colour-vision and that he always felt every confidence in leaving him in charge during his watch. We shall be very pleased to give him further employment."</quote>
This is from the owners of the steamer in which he served, and it is signed by the manager. Then I hold in my hand letters from the captain, in one of which he says&#x2014;
<quote>"I have no doubt as to his eyesight, having tried him on numerous occasions while on duty at night."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00356">My Lords, the scientific or other examiners living on shore who examine in colour-vision have absolutely nothing at stake should the examinee be colour-blind or otherwise; the captain of a ship has everything at stake&#x2014;he has his own life, the lives

<col>117</col>
of his crew, and the safety of his ship. Therefore I say that these tests, under the actual conditions that prevail at sea and in practice, are of much greater value to my mind than any of the other tests. I am moving for a Select Committee to inquire into this subject. Whether it will be granted or not I cannot say; but some Committee, and not a Departmental Committee, certainly should investigate this matter, and careful instructions should be issued to the various examiners as to the way in which they are to conduct these tests, for, take it how you will, there must be something absolutely wrong in the present system. Mr. Trattles was passed by Captain Young and then by Captain Forrest, who a year afterwards failed him. He has passed at the London Ophthalmic Hospital and at the Royal Eye Infirmary. Then, after being examined by the Court of Inquiry with which the Board of Trade had threatened him should he not surrender his certificate and say he did so voluntarily, and which he had applied for himself, this very Court found that, so far as colour-vision was concerned, he was competent to hold the certificate. Now, my Lords, someone must have been wrong in all these examinations, and therefore I submit that the whole subject demands a searching investigation.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00358"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that in the opinion of the noble Lord the Board of Trade never can do anything right, but I hardly think that on this occasion he will have succeeded in convincing your Lordships that the Board are wrong in being very particular and very careful, as they undoubtedly are, in the matter of these colour-vision tests. Your Lordships know that the whole safety of navigation by night depends upon the man in charge of the ship being able to distinguish between a red light, a green light, and a white light under all conditions of weather and atmosphere, and in those circumstances the very greatest care has to be exercised, and is exercised in these tests. They are based upon the Report of the Committee of the Royal Society to which the noble Lord has alluded, which sat at the request of the Board of Trade in 1892, and of which the most distinguished scientist in your Lord-
<col>118</col>
ships' House&#x2014;Lord Rayleigh&#x2014;was chairman. The <ob/>ests are very much as the noble Lord has described them. The original test is carried out by the Board of Trade examiners or by the Local Board of Trade superintendent at the port. If a candidate fails, he is sent before special examiners, who have invariably been either Sir William Abney or Professor Watson, assisted by Captain Harvey, the chief Board of Trade examiner. These examinations take place at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington.<lb/>
The noble Lord's Notice, as is usual, occupies a considerable amount of the Order Paper, and I find that on the present occasion the catechism is divided into seven parts. I think the only way in which I can satisfy the noble Lord will be by answering each of them in turn. I have alluded to the first one. In the second part the noble Lord asks whether the attention of the President of the Board of Trade has been called to the case of Mr. W. H. Glover. In answer to that I have to say that the attention of my right hon. friend has been called to this case, and not that only he, but everyone at the Board of Trade before whom the case of these two men has come, myself included, feel the deepest sympathy for them; but, unfortunately, they suffer from a physical defect which is absolutely insurmountable in the case of the profession they have adopted, and the duty of the Board of Trade, I am afraid, is perfectly clear.<lb/>
Next, the noble Lord asks whether it is the case that Mr. Glover was certified by the London Local Marine Board, after hearing expert evidence, as fit to discharge the duties of first mate, notwithstanding the fact that three persons who had tested his sight on behalf of the Board of Trade had failed Mr. Glover on the ground that he was defective in colour-vision. Yes; that is the case. Here, again, the facts are as the noble Lord has stated, except that he was passed for second mate and not for first mate, though I do not think that makes any material difference. Mr. Glover, as the noble Lord has stated, on May 28 of this year went before the special examiners, who in this case were Sir William Abney, Professor Watson, and Captain Harvey, who certified that he and the other man, Mr. Trattles, were colour-blind. There were also present on this occasion four other
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0063"/>
<col>119</col>
scientific gentlemen &#x2014; Professor Church, Professor Callendar, Dr. J. H. <ob/>arsons, representing the Ophthalmological Society, and Dr. Rivers, representing the Royal Society; and all those gentlemen agreed absolutely with the decision that was come to by the examiners. There were other gentlemen present as friends of the men who were being examined. The noble Lord has quoted from the letter of one of these&#x2014;a doctor; and I think I ought to quote from the Report which Dr. Rivers presented to the Royal Society. Dr. Rivers wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I attended on May 28 the special examination of two men who had been rejected by the Board of Trade for abnormal colour-vision and had subsequently been certified as normal by a medical practitioner. The two men were tested by means of Sir William Abney's spectral apparatus in a dark room and were asked to name single patches of colour and pairs of such patches, both objective and contrast colours being used. The patches shown were of considerable size, but in spite of this both men made gross errors, all their answers being such as were to be expected from colour-blind persons. One of the two men was usually right with the largest patches shown, but made gross errors with smaller patches and was evidently a case of weakness of colour-vision rather than of absolute colour-blindness."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00359"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: In what capacity was Dr. Rivers attending?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00360"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: He was invited as the representative of the Royal Society. This case having caused considerable comment, the Royal Society agreed to send a representative who would make a Report to them, I think especially in view of the fact that these tests are based on the Report of their Committee. The Report of Dr. Rivers proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"In addition, one of the two men was put through the Holmgren wool-test, and he gave a good example of the method of responding to this test followed by those who have been especially coached to pass it. There could be no doubt that in each man the condition of vision would be a definite source of danger at sea."</quote>
The last paragraph of the report is as follows, and I think it answers what the noble Lord has said&#x2014;
<quote>"The only criticism I have to offer is that, though the tests must have been absolutely convincing to any one acquainted with the subject, their effect on the representatives of shipping bodies and other lay persons present may have been rendered less definite by the rapidity with which they were carried out. What might have been an absolutely convincing demonstration of the abnormality of the two men may have been marred, so far as lay persons were concerned, by this rapidity."</quote>
<col>120</col>
I think that accounts for the opinion which the noble Lord has read to the House.<lb/>
The noble Lord then asks whether the Board of Trade propose to take any further action in this matter. Yes. In view of the opinions which have been expressed, it is impossible for the Board of Trade to take the responsibility of allowing these men to hold their certificates so far as the Board of Trade are empowered in that matter; and, as the noble Lord has said, the Board of Trade have written to these men asking them to surrender their certificates, and if they do not do so the Board will be compelled reluctantly to bring the case before one of the Courts which deal with these matters. They are bound to do this in the public interest. Then the noble Lord asks in how many cases within recent times have candidates who have already passed the colour-vision test been rejected on going up for further examination. I can give him the figures for the last four years. In 1905 there were none; in 1906, two; in 1907, one; and in 1908, two&#x2014;a total for the four years of five. I think I ought to supplement these figures by stating that the total number examined for colour-vision during that period was 25,151, that the number who failed was 239; of the failures sixty-four appealed to South Kensington, and of these twenty-seven were passed on appeal and thirty-seven were rejected.<lb/>
The noble Lord also called attention to the case of Mr. Trattles. His case is, again, much as the noble Lord has stated. In 1905, I think, he had already failed. He went up for examination and was rejected, and the Board of Trade then asked him to resign his certificate. As he did not do so, they brought him before a Local Marine Board in London. The Board heard the expert evidence of the Board of Trade, they also heard medical evidence on behalf of Mr. Trattles, and they determined, as the noble Lord has said, that when doctors differed they would decide for themselves. They accordingly subjected Mr. Trattles, as I understand, to a very crude test with wools, and decided on the strength of that, and in opposition to the scientific evidence of the Board of Trade, that he had normal colour-vision. There, for the moment, the responsibility of the Board of Trade ended. But when he presented himself for a further certificate it was necessary that he should
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0064"/>
<col>121</col>
be examined again. He again failed, and went before the same Board, in May of this year, as Mr. Glover whose case I have already alluded to.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord moves for a Select Committee to inquire into the conditions under which eyesight tests for mercantile marine certificates are conducted. I have to say that the Board of Trade are of opinion that these tests, as at present carried out, are efficient, and that they do not consider that any case has been made out for a Select Committee. The tests, as I have said, were based upon the Report of the Royal Society, and ever since they were established the Board have been in constant communication on this subject with Sir William Abney, who is recognised as being the greatest living authority on this matter in the country. The noble Lord shakes his head. When I saw this Notice on the Paper I communicated with Lord Rayleigh because I thought that your Lordships would like, if possible, to have the opinion of that very eminent scientist. Lord Rayleigh has written regretting that it is impossible for him to be present, but authorising me to say that he does not think the Board of Trade can be wrong in following the advice of Sir William Abney. I submit that the whole of the scientific evidence in this matter is on the side of the Board of Trade in the course they have adopted, and I submit that no case has been made out for further inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00361"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure your Lordships will be grateful to the noble Lord who has just sat down for the very full manner in which he has gone into this case. At the beginning of his remarks he was rather inclined to resent the criticisms which from time to time my noble friend who sits behind me levels at the Board of Trade. I am quite sure the noble Lord opposite will not think that I underrate the services of the Board of Trade, or that I have ever been inclined to criticise them unfairly. On the contrary, I know too well how exceedingly valuable a public Department this is, and how able and experienced are the servants which the State has in that office. But I do not think your Lordships will be inclined to quarrel with my noble friend if he, even at the risk of tilting against a great public Department, comes forward in order to plead the cause of individuals who see, it may be by an inevitable misfortune, their whole method of gaining a livelihood threatened. We would
<col>122</col>
be, like any other body of Englishmen, very tender towards such men, and we are obliged to my noble friend for pleading cases such as theirs before your Lordships. But I think that, my noble friend having heard the great weight of authority which the noble Lord opposite was able to produce in favour of the system pursued by the Board of Trade and the immense care that had evidently been taken in the examination of these two men, he will not be inclined to press further the criticisms he has made.<lb/>
I speak with great diffidence on this subject, but I have, perhaps, a special claim to be heard because I am colour-blind myself&#x2014;not, perhaps, completely colour-blind, but quite sufficiently so to have been rejected under the tests which the noble Lord has described to the House. And perhaps I might contribute just this one mite to the discussion of the subject, as it may be&#x2014;I am speaking from my own experience&#x2014;an explanation of the inconsistencies, to which my noble friend has drawn attention, at the hands of the various authorities before whom these two gentlemen were examined. I am convinced that colour-blindness is very capricious. On some days I am much more colour-blind than on others. That capriciousness may easily account for the fact that when these gentlemen were before one authority they fared better than when before another. But, from the point of view of the mercantile marine, of course such caprice might be very dangerous; and therefore I am afraid that, from my own experience, I cannot quarrel with the Board of Trade for having applied these rigid tests; nor can I shrink from the consequence, which means in this case that these gentlemen must be content to abandon the profession which they had adopted. On the whole, I cannot regret that the subject has been brought before your Lordships' House. It has, at any rate, satisfied us that no injustice has been done, and it has given the noble Lord opposite an opportunity of explaining to your Lordships how careful and elaborate are the precautions taken to protect the lives of those in the mercantile marine, and how great is the care at the same time not unduly to injure the professional prospects of those engaged in that great profession.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00362"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with reference to the statement of the noble Marquess that colour-blindness is very capricious, I think it is remarkable that Mr. Trattles during all the time he was at
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0065"/>
<col>123</col>
sea was not colour-blind. The noble Lord opposite has stated that no case has been made out for an Inquiry. I would remind him that these gentlemen had passed the colour-vision test. If they were colour-blind, then there must have been some mistake on the part of those who tested them; there must have been something wrong if they were passed. If a mistake was made in these cases, how many men have been allowed to go to sea who are colour-blind? It gives one a very uneasy feeling, for evidently those first examinations were not effective. I will not press for a Select Committee, but I would ask my noble friend opposite to bring the matter to the notice of the President of the Board of Trade. It is not the examination but the mode in which it is conducted that is complained of. The Board of Trade adopt the Holmgren wool-test, but when they do so they should carry out the instructions issued with the test, and it should not be left to the individual caprice of any examiner to use the test as he likes.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE VISIT OF THE FLEET TO THE<lb/> THAMES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00364"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member> had the following Notice on the Paper&#x2014;
<quote>"To call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the fact that if ships were sunk or mines were laid in or at the mouth of the River Thames the night before or the night after the intended visit of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs to the Fleet, nearly the whole of our available naval strength would be bottled up and unable to leave that river, thereby laying our coasts open to invasion; and to ask them whether, considering the enormous interests at stake, and the extraordinary progress of modern inventions, the time has not come when precautions equivalent to those constantly observed at Gibraltar, but varying in accordance with circumstances, should not at all times be taken to prevent the main body of our Fleets becoming the object of a successful surprise, and whether precautions of this nature will be taken while our principal Fleets are assembled in the Thames."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00365">The noble Lord said: My Lords, my Question as it appears on the Paper was originally based on the plan which appeared in the newspapers, and which I understood to be a copy of the Admiralty plan. Whether that was the case or not, the plan has since been considerably altered. In the original plan nineteen large ships, including the "Inflexible,"
<col>124</col>
the "Indomitable," and the "Invincible," which are of the Dreadnought type, were marked to be moored in the narrow waters between Erith and Thames Haven. This morning I received another plan from the Admiralty. In it I find that all the large ships referred to and a number of others are to be placed much lower down the river in positions where the Thames is so broad that any attempts to block its channel by sinking ships are not likely to meet with success. A number of destroyers and submarines are also to remain near the Fleet instead of being placed near London Bridge, as in the original plan. It formed no part of my Question to ask for a detailed account of the precautions that ought to have been taken. It is enough for me to say now that I consider that if the Admiral in command is allowed a free hand as regards merchant vessels and others that may approach his lines of anchorage the means at his disposal appear to be sufficient to ensure the safety of the Fleet during its stay at Southend.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00366">There is, however, the second part of my Question, in which I ask whether, considering the enormous interests at stake, and the extraordinary progress of modern inventions, the time has not come when precautions equivalent to those constantly observed at Gibraltar, but varying in accordance with circumstances, should not at all times be taken to prevent the main body of our Fleets becoming the object of a successful surprise. We remain, and I hope we shall long continue to remain, on friendly terms with Spain; yet certain precautions against surprise are taken at Gibraltar every day, and these are redoubled every night. In future when our Fleets are within reach of a powerful rival they ought habitually to take precautions as much as Gibraltar does. If they did that as a rule and as a matter of habit it would not excite attention, whereas if they only did so when relations were strained it would increase the probability of war breaking out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00367">Many people consider that the danger of a successful surprise is not great. In the next war an effort may be made to make the initial hostilities the war itself instead of a mere incident in the opening of a campaign. Such an attempt would, of course, never be made unless the country
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0066"/>
<col>125</col>
attacked was possessed of territory, commerce, or some other advantages that her rival was desirous of obtaining for herself. We have these, and if we wish to keep them we must recollect that we shall have to contend with a post-torpedo diplomacy&#x2014;a very different thing from the pre-torpedo diplomacy of which we have historical knowledge. Diplomacy is invariably flexible, and is sure to adapt itself to the situation created by the new weapons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00368">I have lately been reading a German book, <i>Deutschlands Flotte im Kampf</i>, which is written in the form of a naval history of the next war. It commences with what the author calls a <i>Fallen-stellen</i>. Mine-layers disguised as merchant ships, with British names and ports painted on them, steam slowly about in the open sea in disconnected manner until they receive by wireless telegraphy the order to attack. The officer in command of them calls this a most genial idea. After describing the manner in which the surprise was effected, the writer sneers at our Minister of Marine, who, when taunted in Parliament for not having taken measures to prevent this disaster, feebly replies that&#x2014;
<quote>"It was impossible to be prepared against an attack delivered with such infamous cunning."</quote>
The reason which induced me to put down the first part of my Notice no longer exists, but I still desire to ask the Question which forms the second part, as it is of vital importance that every precaution should be taken for the safety of our Fleets.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00369"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it will not be necessary for me to detain your Lordships for more than a few moments in replying to my noble friend. I am sorry that he had the trouble of putting down this Question, especially the first part of it. If he had waited until this morning he would have seen the official programme, from which it is clear that only twelve large ships go above Southend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00370"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: They are only comparatively small ships. I did not count them among the nineteen to which I referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00371"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: Therefore, so far as the first part of my noble friend's Question is concerned, he is perfectly satis-
<col>126</col>
fied. Then the noble Lord spoke of the precautions necessary and asked whether the time had not come when precautions equivalent to those at present observed at Gibraltar should not at all times be taken. I will bring the suggestion of the noble Lord to the notice of the Admiralty and ask them to consider it very carefully. At the present moment, however, they are of opinion that all adequate precautions are taken for the safety of the Fleet wherever it happens to be at rest. The noble Lord seemed to contemplate the outbreak of hostilities without any declaration of war, and that everything would be done by an initial surprise. I cannot believe that such a thing would ever happen, and I need hardly say that any such act on the part of any foreign country would be regarded as, I might almost say, an act of treachery. At present our arrangements with foreign Powers are excellent. There is no cloud on the horizon, and I sincerely trust that that state of things may go on for many years to come.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00372"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be glad if the noble Earl could throw a little further light on this subject. In the original statement published in the newspapers it was stated that a considerable number of large vessels were to be in very narrow waters up the Thames. That was felt, and not unreasonably felt, by the uninitiated, and even by others, to be a somewhat risky operation, and people were naturally anxious to know what the object of the operation was. It certainly does appear to me that it is unnecessary to place ships in what may be a risky position, except for some really useful purpose. The noble Earl has told us that there is not a cloud in the sky, and that an act such as setting mines and blocking the Channel would be an act of treachery. I hope we are not going to rely for the safety of our Fleet upon anything of that kind; our business is to make it perfectly certain that such operations will be impossible. I should like to know whether the first scheme set forth in the newspapers was the scheme of the Admiralty, and, if so, why it has been changed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00373"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that we are not in a position positively to answer the question which the noble Earl has put. My impression is that the first scheme
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0067"/>
<col>127</col>
described and published in the newspapers was not the authorised scheme, but I should not like to say so with certainty. We will make inquiries as to whether the scheme, which I understand is now considered to be unobjectionable, represents a modification, or whether it was the first scheme which the Admiralty devised.<lb/>
On the general question, I entirely agree with the noble Earl who has just sat down that it is not right, in affairs of this kind, to exclude the possibility of a <i>coup de main</i> of any kind, and in the disposition of our defences undoubtedly we ought not to ignore the possibility of sudden attacks. But, on the other hand, there are limits to the precautions which it is possible to take&#x2014;limits which must, I think, be dictated partly by the teaching of history and partly by what we may assume to be human nature. If the noble Lord who introduced this subject is right, every one of His Majesty's ships should always have her torpedo nets down and the guns' crews should be perpetually ready every hour of the day and night for a presumed attack. If such were the practice of all nations, national life, I venture to submit, would become altogether impossible. The strain upon the service would be so great that the mere fact of taking such exaggerated precautions&#x2014;precautions which alone, I think we must all agree, would meet certain kinds of absolutely unprovoked attack&#x2014;would make war almost inevitable.<lb/>
The noble Lord and those who agree with him are also represented in other European countries. The same kind of scares exist there&#x2014;rumours of British fleets appearing and preparing to bombard important towns when no difference or question of any kind exists between the two countries. We know how impossible such an attack on our part is, and whatever we may think of other countries, we are bound to assume that there is a certain sort of what I may call brigand attack which would not be made by any civilised Power. But I am far indeed from saying that we ought not at all times, in time of peace as well as in time of anxiety, to take all reasonable precautions, and I am quite certain that my right hon. friend at the head of the Admiralty is as fully convinced of this as the noble Earl opposite.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ASSURANCE COMPANIES BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00374" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00375">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00376"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the objects of this Bill are two&#x2014;the consolidation and the amendment of the law regarding insurance and assurance. I use those two words advisedly because they are both to be found in the Bill. The word "assurance" is used where life business is dealt with, and the word "insurance" where other forms of business are dealt with. I confess that up till yesterday I was under the impression that the separate use of those words was nothing more than a custom of the trade, but I found on investigation that there is very sound precedent for a separate use of the words. The earliest precedent, I think, goes back to the year 1670. I cannot promise that I shall invariably use the words in the right place myself, but I thought it well to give the reason for their both appearing in the Bill.<lb/>
As far as consolidation goes, I do not think I need labour the point. The advantage of consolidating the law of insurance is very much the same as the advantage which has been claimed for the many other Consolidation Bills which have passed through Parliament in recent years. It will, I think, obviously be more convenient that the law of insurance shall be contained in a single Act rather than be spread over half a dozen. The more important point in the Bill is the amendment which it is designed to make in the existing law; and here I have a small difficulty. An amending Bill of this sort is necessarily made up of a mass of small details. Any of these details may very properly be dealt with in Committee, but it is quite impossible to mention all of them on Second Reading. What I shall endeavour to do, therefore, is to indicate generally the nature of the alterations in the law as they will affect each different class of insurance.<lb/>
First of all I ought to point out that the Bill does not strike out any new line in regard to the control of insurance by the State. We have not followed the example of certain foreign countries where there is a very complete, and, I might almost say, a grandmotherly control of insurance. The
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0068"/>
<col>129</col>
model that has been followed is the control which has hitherto been exercised over life assurance business. I use the word "control," but in reality companies are given the greatest possible freedom to carry on their business in their own way. The two main conditions imposed upon them are these. First of all every new company before it is allowed to commence business in this country has to deposit with the Paymaster-General a sum of&#x00A3;20,000; and, secondly, each company has every year to file with the Board of Trade its accounts in certain specified forms. The first of these provisions&#x2014;the deposit of&#x00A3;20,000&#x2014;has been found to be most useful in preventing the formation of unsubstantial life assurance companies, but it has never been pretended that after the company has collected a certain amount of business the deposit was any protection whatever to the insurers, because&#x00A3;20,000 might very likely be but a small fraction of the liabilities of the company. The real security afforded to the insurer in the case of established companies is the publicity given to their accounts by the Board of Trade. The two main provisions of this Bill consist in extending to other forms of insurance those two provisions which have hitherto been confined to life assurance companies. Those two provisions have raised British life assurance companies to a very high level indeed&#x2014;a very much higher level than they ever attained before the passing of the Act of 1870.<lb/>
There is undoubtedly a necessity for extending these provisions to fire, accident, sickness, and bond investment companies. They have already been extended by the Act of 1907 to employers' liability companies. I take the case of fire companies as being typical. The great majority of British fire companies are beyond question sound, but there have been cases&#x2014;I do not know whether there are now, but there certainly have been cases&#x2014;where that soundness has not existed. Particularly has this been the case among British companies carrying on business abroad, of which very frequent complaints have been made by our Consuls. I do not know why, but for some reason or another Turkey and Norway seem to have been selected principally as the field of operation of these concerns, many of which were nothing better than a swindle. The most impudent case of all, the case

I should like to quote as showing the length to which it is possible to go under the existing law, was that of a company called the Credit Foncier Company&#x2014;a British company registered in this country and which carried on considerable fire insurance business in Constantinople. When this company failed to meet its liability it was ascertained that its paid-up capital amounted to exactly seven sovereigns. A thing of that sort must be very bad indeed for British credit abroad, and it ought not to be possible that it should happen. It is, of course, a monstrous exception to the usual stability of British fire companies, but there have unfortunately been other cases of companies whose capital, though far more than&#x00A3;7, was, nevertheless, quite inadequate in view of the risks which they cheerfully and hopefully undertook.<lb/>
This applies also to other forms of insurance, such as accident and sickness insurance, to meet which risks a number of companies are in existence. Most of these companies, again, are perfectly sound concerns, but there are some which have started business with a financial backing altogether inadequate unless they are very lucky and very discriminating in the risks they undertake. And I may say that luck and discrimination are just what you do not expect to find in these cases, because the people who have first-class risks to insure naturally go to the established and sound companies, and the new and doubtful ones have to take what is left, so that disaster is very likely. This Bill provides that all new companies, with whatever class of insurance they may deal, shall deposit a sum of&#x00A3;20,000 before they will be allowed to commence business, and they will also be obliged to file their accounts with the Board of Trade in certain forms which are set out in the Schedules of the Bill.<lb/>
Then there is another class of insurance also dealt with&#x2014;bond investment companies. They also would come under the same rules, and under Section (E) of the Fifth Schedule of the Bill it is provided that they will have to give statistics of the number of policies which have lapsed during the past year and particulars of the conditions upon which policyholders allowed to surrender their policies should they desire to do so. That is the same form of protection which is given
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0069"/>
<col>131</col>
to other classes of insurers, and it seems really to be the only adequate form of protection and the only adequate way of bringing to the notice of people who take out these policies the real nature of the bargain into which they enter.<lb/>
I have alluded to the deposit of&#x00A3;20,000 which is now required from life companies. At present a life assurance company is allowed to withdraw that sum when the accumulated life funds amount to&#x00A3;40,000. A Select Committee of this House, over which my noble friend the Lord Steward presided, recommended that that practice of allowing the withdrawal of the deposit should be discontinued. That is done by the Bill. Accordingly, all life companies which have exercised that right will now be called upon to redeposit the money. I may say that the representatives of British life assurance interests have been approached on this matter, and I understand that they have signified their willingness to do this. It is thought that this provision will be particularly useful in the case of foreign companies. My noble friend's Committee recommended that no discrimination should be made against foreign companies, and in that recommendation they were supported by the almost unanimous opinion expressed by the representatives of British assurance interests who came before them. The Select Committee recommended that every company which carries on business in Great Britain should be required to maintain the deposit of&#x00A3;20,000 so long as any policies continued outstanding in this country. The Committee said&#x2014;
<quote>"We are aware that this sum would be of littl use to meet the liabilities of large companies which do business in this country, but we feel that if this amount were deposited and could not be withdrawn by the company it would afford an absolute guarantee to policyholders in foreign countries of being able always to proceed, if necessary, against such companies in the Courts of this country."</quote>
I may add that the object of the Committee has been furthered by a provision of the Companies Act of 1907, which requires that all foreign companies who have a place of business in this country must file with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies the name and address of some person resident in the United Kingdom who may be sued on their behalf. I do not think I need say anything more about the life assurance companies.<lb/>
<col>132</col>
Clause 34 of the Bill deals with collecting societies and industrial insurance companies. The clause is designed to regularise the position of these great undertakings, and to facilitate the conversion of collecting societies into companies where that is thought to be desirable. I may say that this has been rendered necessary by the enormous growth of some of these societies. One society alone, I am informed, has a membership of 2,200,000 and has altogether outgrown the machinery of the Friendly Societies Acts under which it is registered. This Bill is designed to give to policyholders and intending insurers the fullest possible protection which can reasonably be given, and, at the same time, to avoid any undue interference with the business of the companies. If your Lordships agree to its being read a second time to-day I will undertake not to put down the Committee stage for three weeks, so that if we have unwittingly trodden on anybody's toes he may have an opportunity of coming to the Board of Trade and explaining his case to us, when I can promise that it will receive the fullest and the most careful consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00377">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Hamilton of Dalzell</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00378"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend has given a very clear and sufficient explanation of the Bill which he is asking the House to read a second time, and I think your Lordships will agree with him that it was unnecessary at this stage to go into more details. I believe he is correct in stating that the life assurance companies are quite prepared to agree to what has been suggested by His Majesty's Government, and to give a general support to the Bill. They will be obliged to the noble Lord for his promise to allow a reasonable time before taking the Committee stage, particularly as there are still points which we hope His Majesty's Government may consider; and I trust that in regard to such suggestions of the insurance companies as may seem to be reasonable an agreement may in the interval be arrived at with the Board of Trade.<lb/>
There are still points on which many of the insurance offices would like to see some change in the Bill. In the first place, as regards the reserve for unexpired risks, if I understand the Bill correctly no amount is laid down in the Bill. Insurance offices
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0070"/>
<col>133</col>
generally consider that 33&#x2153;per cent. is about the minimum amount that ought to be held as a reserve for unexpired risks. The general opinion is that it would be very desirable to settle some minimum percentage. Another point arises with reference to foreign deposits. It is thought that the exception which is made in Note 1 of the Third Schedule&#x2014;
<quote>"NOTE 1.&#x2014;When part of the assets of the company is specifically deposited, under local laws, in various places out of the United Kingdom as security to holders of policies there issued, each such place and the amount compulsorily lodged therein must be specified in respect of each class of business, except that in the case of fire insurance business it shall be sufficient to state the fact that a part of the assets has been so deposited"</quote>
ought also to extend to employers' liability business.<lb/>
With reference to amalgamations between companies, one of the provisions laid down in the Bill is that in the case of an amalgamation or transfer there shall be a notification to every policyholder of each company. So far as life policies are concerned, no doubt there is sufficient reason for that, but I ask my noble friend to consider whether it is really necessary in the case of fire, accident, and employers' liability policies. These policies are for short periods, and as regards employers' liability it seems the less necessary because it appears to be already covered under the law as it now stands. In any case it seems to most of us that it would be practically impossible in the case of amalgamation to give notice to all the policyholders if it is to apply to fire, accident, and employers' liability business. As regards employers' liability business, everybody to whom an amount is due or a weekly payment is payable would come within the definition of policyholder, and it does seem unnecessary that they should all have notice, however essential that may be in the case of life policies. There are several other minor points with which I need not trouble the House at this stage; and I hope that before the three weeks have elapsed many of them may be satisfactorily settled with the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00379"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAR AND KELLIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think this Bill will be welcomed, not only by the public, but by the insurance companies themselves as an attempt to put the law in relation to those companies on a more sound and improved
<col>134</col>
footing. There are, however, one or two points to which I should like to call your Lordships' attention very briefly.<lb/>
Clause 1 denotes the various classes of insurance business to which the Act is to apply, and subsection (c) of that clause applies its provisions to accident insurance, which is defined as&#x2014;
<quote>"the undertaking of liability under policies of insurance upon the happening of accidents whether fatal or not disease or sickness or any class of accidents disease or sickness."</quote>
It appears that under this subsection the framers have in view personal accident insurance only, but as the subsection reads it would also include liabilities which many companies incur resulting from personal injuries under such contracts as property owners', third party, and vehicle owners' liability policies. Under these policies the risks of damage to persons and to property are included in one premium, and, in rendering the account which will be required, on the revenue side will appear the whole premium, while on the expenditure side only the amount paid in respect of damage to persons. It may be the intention to include this class of insurance under this subsection, but, if so, I suggest that the phraseology of the subsection should be made somewhat clearer.<lb/>
Clauses 30 and 31 provides that the Bill is not to apply to fire insurance and accident insurance companies existing prior to its passing, and Clause 32 provides that employers' liability insurance companies are not affected by the Act if they were in existence prior to August, 1907, the date of the last Employers' Liability Act. Therefore these companies are not required to make a separate deposit against each class of insurance business transacted. I think it very desirable that, as in the case of life business, the Act should be made retrospective in all its provisions, and that the old companies as well as the new companies should be required to make and maintain a separate deposit in the case of each of the four classes of insurance business described in Clause 1.<lb/>
Again, subsection (e) of Clause 32 provides that under certain conditions securities may be released in the case of employers' liability insurance. This subsection is obviously taken from the Life Assurance Companies Act of 1870, which
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0071"/>
<col>135</col>
I understand is repealed by this Bill. I cannot see why securities should be released in the case of employers' liability when they cannot be released in the case of fire, life, or accident insurance business. But these are really Committee points, and I will not pursue them further at this stage. I hope that when the Committee stage is reached the Government will be prepared to accept Amendments for improving and strengthening the Bill. In any case, speaking as a director of an insurance company and a member of the insuring public, I should like to express a hope that the Government will find time to place this measure on the Statute-book this session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00380"><member>LORD KINNAIRD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to think the insurance companies will heartily support His Majesty's Government in their endeavour to pass this Bill during the present session. As representing two of these companies I would thank the Government for the way in which they have met the suggestions made, and I am hopeful that other suggestions will be accepted at a later stage. There are one or two points to which the noble Lord did not refer in moving the Second Reading of the Bill. One is the position of members of Lloyd's. It is not quite clear whether the term "underwriter" is sufficiently defined, and whether it might not be held to include every one of those members of Lloyd's who puts his name to a policy. I understand that it is not the intention of the Government that each one of the members of Lloyd's whose name is on a policy should deposit the sum mentioned. Further, I think, on behalf of the companies, we might ask the Government to consider, in some matters in which the insurance companies are, in their estimation, put at a disadvantage as compared to some members of Lloyd's, whether it may not be desirable for them to accept an Amendment which would place the companies in the same position. I understand that the object of the companies as well as of the Government is that any one who is doing business with absolutely inadequate capital should not be allowed to go on, either at home or abroad, and that there should be publicity given to the financial position of those who are undertaking very large liabilities. I will not trespass further on the time of the House to-day, but I hope that in such an important matter, involving large
<col>136</col>
interests, there will not be undue haste, but that full consideration will be given to the suggestions made. We have had experience in connection with Acts relating to employers' liability and workmen's compensation of the many pitfalls which arise in consequence of hasty legislation. I thank the Government for the way in which they have met the suggestions that have been made, and I join with the noble Lord who last spoke in expressing the hope that the Bill may become law this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00381"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord in charge of the Bill has intimated that three weeks will be allowed between this and the Committee stage, and I think one may hope that during the interval the opportunity to which he referred of a conference between the bodies interested and the Board of Trade will be so utilised as to remove the causes of the criticisms which now attach to certain provisions of the Bill. On the whole, I think the Bill is welcomed by insurance companies.<lb/>
The Bill does involve a somewhat new departure in what may be called, perhaps, its leading first principle&#x2014;that of requiring from fire insurance companies a deposit of&#x00A3;20,000. Fire insurance contracts differ essentially from those of life assurance. The circumstances in connection with the former are temporary; the contracts may be modified, changed, or dropped. If an insurer thinks he cannot trust a company and any reason arises suggesting the propriety of transferring his business to another company, he can, with little difficulty, make the requisite change. It is essentially different in the case of life assurance, where the contract is made for many years and the contracting party enters into a contract from which he cannot afterwards depart without great loss&#x2014;possibly the loss of the whole of the advantage he had in view when he entered into the contract. It is obvious that a person effecting a policy of life assurance ought to be protected in the way proposed; but no such reason can be discovered in the case of fire insurance, and the introduction of that principle here is a novelty.<lb/>
My noble friend suggested a reason for this provision in the unfortunate fact that certain companies have been estab-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0072"/>
<col>137</col>
lished, though they have not done business, in this country, and have deluded residents in other countries, especially in Turkey and in Norway; and perhaps for the honour of our name we ought to interfere to prevent this happening in the future. But I would point out to my noble friend that he is introducing this principle of requiring a deposit from fire insurance companies only in the case of those companies which come into existence after the passing of the Bill. That is, in my opinion, straining the doctrine of vested interest very hard. I am sure that no respectable company would hesitate to make the deposit, and if it is unfortunately the case that many recent companies have started into existence with inadequate capital, or which have been the instruments, or capable of being made the instruments, of such deceit abroad as my noble friend referred to, then such companies had better be brought as soon as possible under the provisions of the Bill. I think we shall have to consider the question of making the provision to which I have referred apply to existing companies.<lb/>
It follows from requiring a deposit from fire insurance companies that the question to which my noble friend who has just sat down referred arises&#x2014;What are you going to do in the case of underwriters at Lloyd's? An underwriter under the Bill as it stands is required to make a deposit&#x2014;a limited deposit, but a deposit. The members of Lloyd's are exempted from making a deposit as long as they comply with the rules of association of Lloyd's. That seems to me a very singular position to assume. It is a matter of delicacy, but it will have to be considered if you are to make your legislation consistent.<lb/>
There is another provision in the Bill requiring foreign life assurance companies which do business in this country to make the deposit and publish accounts in the same way as our companies. That, I think, differs in some degree from the conclusion of the Select Committee of your Lordships' House which sat upon this subject and presented a Report three years ago. That point, however, can be cleared up in the interval between this and the Committee stage. I will not dwell upon it further now, except to say that it raises some very delicate considerations with respect to international comity of legislation in matters of trade. I note the assurance given by my noble friend that an
<col>138</col>
interval of three weeks shall elapse before the Committee stage is taken, and I hope that during that interval the conciliatory action which has already, I know, been adopted by the Board of Trade in conference with representatives of insurance companies may lead to a settlement of minor points, so that the Bill may become law this session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00382"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to offer any remarks to your Lordships at any rate on the present occasion, because, as my noble friend Lord Mar said just now, all the questions which have been raised are practically Committee points. I do not think the noble Lord opposite has any reason to complain of the manner in which the Bill has been received. It has been received with general favour.<lb/>
The only point which has been really dwelt upon has been the question of whether the&#x00A3;20,000 deposit in the case of a fire company should be made retrospective or not. As. the noble Lord who has just sat down said, the provision in Clause 1 of the Bill is a new departure, and <i>prim&#x00E2;facie</i> one would expect that a new departure would not be made retrospective in character. But that is really a matter for the facts of evidence to determine. I had the impression that there were not existing at this moment a material number of the bogus companies of which the noble Lord spoke. If there are a large number that require to be controlled, that might be a good reason for making the provision retrospective. If, on the other hand, when we come to consider the Bill in Committee the noble Lord, on behalf of the Board of Trade, is able to assure us that there are none, or very few, then one would be rather inclined not to make it retrospective. But that is a matter which can be discussed in detail when we reach the Committee stage.<lb/>
The only other remark I am tempted to make will take the form of a general observation. When we are dealing with these Bills which are in a large degree consolidation and in a small degree amending Bills, would it not be possible so to print them that there might be some indication on the face of the Bill as to what is consolidation and what is amendment? Many of your Lordships are very hard-worked men, and it would save an immense amount of trouble if my suggestion could be carried out. Matters may, of course, be so dovetailed as to render this impracticable, but it very often is not so, and if the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0073"/>
<col>139</col>
noble Lord will devote his ability to that point in regard to Board of Trade Bills, in which this phenomenon frequently occurs, it will save considerable time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00383"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think His Majesty's Government have every reason to be gratified by the reception which has been given to this Bill, and I hope for the measure an easy passage through your Lordships' House. I am sure your Lordships will agree that for a Bill of this technical character, the course suggested in regard to conference between the bodies interested and the Department concerned is probably the best method of procedure.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to the exception which is made in favour of fire insurance offices in Note 1 of the Third Schedule, and he was anxious that that exception should be extended to companies which do other classes of business besides fire insurance. The noble Lord probably knows that this exception as it stands in the Bill does not meet with universal approval, and that there are those who think that the exception should not be allowed to remain. His Majesty's Government, therefore, are betwixt two fires. The noble Lord behind me, Lord Courtney, seemed to object to the inclusion of fire insurance companies at all in this connection, and he laid emphasis upon the difference between the business conducted by a fire insurance and life assurance office.<lb/>
As to the matter of accounts, I regret that although I was Chairman of the Select Committee which went into this matter I cannot safely charge my memory with the details;
<col>140</col>
but I have a very clear impression that the details with regard to accounts which are asked for in this Bill in the case of foreign companies doing business in this country are practically those already required in the United States and in other countries. Therefore accounts of that kind will not inflict any great hardship on the various companies. The noble Marquess who has just spoken referred to the point as to whether the provision regarding fire insurance companies should be made retrospective. I am sorry that the question of fire insurance companies was not included in the terms of reference to the Select Committee. On that account we were unable to go into the question.<lb/>
The suggestion of the noble Marquess that there should be some distinction made in Bills between what is mere consolidation and what are matters of amendment has been brought forward more than once by noble Lords on both sides of the House. My impression is that this is not entirely a matter for any Government Department. I think the suggestion would be very useful and of great assistance, but I rather think it is one which should come before the House of Lords Offices Committee. The matter of printing is not directly under the control of the Government in this House, and certainly it would be necessary to take the Committee's advice and the advice of the printers before anything could be done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00404"><member>LORD NUNBURNHOLME</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to move the Second Reading of this Bill I feel that the matter we are about to discuss would have been put before you with more force by my noble friend Lord Wenlock, the Chairman of the East Riding County Council. Your Lordships have before you a Memorandum briefly dealing with the history of this subject. Under former Acts of Parliament it was necessary for the county councils of the three Ridings of Yorkshire to appoint as registrar a gentleman who had been a solicitor or sub-registrar. To obtain the services of a gentleman as registrar who was to do no other work, the county councils of Yorkshire had to pay
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0075"/>
<col>143</col>
a good salary&#x2014;&#x00A3;700 or &#x00A3;800 a year; and the County Council of the East Riding of Yorkshire are fully convinced that they themselves could do this work through their clerk by giving him &#x00A3;100 a year for that purpose, thus saving the larger expense of making a separate appointment. This is rather a dull subject, but in these days of increasing taxation I feel that I can make some appeal to your Lordships' sympathy in favour of this Bill. In the East Riding we have always had our rates fairly low, and the county council are desirous of keeping them low. We see a way here of saving some &#x00A3;700 a year, and with your permission we should like to do it. There is another point in favour of this Bill. The clerk of a county council has a large staff under him. Therefore if any gentleman came to the registry and wanted promptly information relating to a particular subject he could probably get it within a few hours and certainly within a day, whereas if you had a registrar with a very small staff or no staff at all it would take him two or three days, or perhaps a week, to supply the desired information. After all, this is no experiment as regards the East Riding, because it has been provisionally working with the utmost satisfaction to all parties since the year 1902. We find in the East Riding that a registrar would have very little to do. I believe the average number of deeds dealt with is about sixteen a day, to which he would have merely to attach his signature and then file away a copy. I understand that Lord Zetland, on behalf of the North Riding County Council, desires to move an Amendment in Committee dealing with the administration of this Bill, and, subject to the opinion of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, I propose, on behalf of the East Riding, to accept it when the proper time comes. I hope your Lordships will see your way to let this Bill pass. It is strictly
<col>144</col>
non-political, and I believe that the county councils of the three Ridings of Yorkshire are practically unanimous in desiring that it should become law.</membercontribution></p>

Section 37, subsection (1), of the Yorkshire Registries Act, 1884, as amended by Section 46, subsection (4), of the Local Government Act, 1888, provides for the appointment by the county council, subject only to confirmation by the Lord Chancellor, of a registrar of deeds when and so soon as the office of any then existing registrar falls vacant. It is, therefore, clear that as the Local Government Board have no jurisdiction with regard to the appointment of these officials they are not directly concerned with the contents of the present Bill. At the same time, I am desired to state, on behalf of the Local Government Board, that they see no reason for offering any opposition to the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF THE<lb/> FORCES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00432"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether it was intended to make any alteration in
<col>148</col>
the duties of the Inspector-General of the Forces, and to move for Papers. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I need not detain your Lordships for more than a few minutes in asking the Question which stands in my name, although it covers a point of very great importance. Your Lordships will remember that following on the Report of Lord Esher's Committee considerable reorganisation in the higher commands of the Army took place. Amongst the new posts created was that of Inspector-General of the Forces&#x2014;a post which was created, amongst other reasons, as it was said at the time, in order that this officer should be the "eyes and ears of the Army Council." His duties were carefully defined by Order in Council, and the Order is now on the Table of your Lordships' House. But, my Lords, we now learn that a new Order in Council has been drafted. I do not know whether there is anything in the new Order in Council which differs from the old Order in Council, and that is the reason for my asking the Question which stands in my name. This Order in Council is evidently not considered a very confidential document because it has been shown to people outside the War Office, and Colonel Repington, who is well known to your Lordships as the distinguished Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, used the following words in a lecture he delivered at Aldershot&#x2014;
<quote>"The new Order in Council defining the duties of the Inspector-General has not been published, and therefore I will not quote it."</quote>
That sentence is quite enough to show that a draft Order in Council is in existence, and that it has been shown to people outside the War Office. I should be the last person to grumble at Colonel Repington being shown any document which the higher authorities at the War Office thought fit to show him, but I do contend that when a document of that importance, containing a change, possibly, in the duties of so high an official, is shown to people outside the War Office, it is time it is shown to Parliament. Therefore, I have put down a Motion that a copy of this draft Order in Council be laid before your Lordships' House.</p>

Paragraphs 16 and 17 embody a very much fuller definition of the duties of the Inspector-General. That was done at the time when the present Inspector-General, Sir John French, succeeded the late Inspector-General, the Duke of Connaught, but, except for that amplification which the Regulations now give of the duties of the Inspector-General, no document has been issued and none is in draft or in contemplation.

<title>SMALL HOLDINGS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00439"><member>LORD EBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture whether he will state what steps have been taken to insure observance of the condition prescribed in the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908, Clauses 1 and 7, that persons availing themselves of its provisions "will themselves cultivate their holdings"; and whether he will lay on the Table any instructions issued by the Board of Agriculture upon that subject.<lb/>
I should have hesitated to ask this Question were it not that the language of the Act to which it applies is liable to arbitrary interpretation from which there is no legal appeal. That being the case, I
<col>150</col>
ask it because I am informed that in urban neighbourhoods county councils, acting under direct inspiration from the Board of Agriculture, are beginning to entertain applications for small holdings from persons who have no pretension at all to be able themselves to cultivate those holdings, and whose only incentive to apply is the chance of obtaining an accommodation tenancy which either needs no cultivation or upon which they can place a <i>locum tenens</i>, and obtaining it at less than the market value. The noble Earl, in his parental rejoicing over the measure to which I am alluding, has, I believe, described it as the Labourers' Charter, and in so far as it has to do with labourers, or anything at all like them, I believe he fully admits himself that he has had the cordial co-operation of landowners in carrying out its provisions. But the innovation to which I refer, having regard to the wording of the Act and to the discussions which have taken place upon the subject, appears to me to go far beyond and outside the intention of Parliament. I greatly hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will be glad of the opportunity which I am giving him of assuring your Lordships that I have been misinformed, and that the practice at which I have pointed has not had and will not have the support, direct or indirect, of the Department over which he presides.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00440"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I shall be able to give a satisfactory answer to the Question which my noble friend has put to me. I shall be happy, if he wishes it, to lay on your Lordships' Table the Instructions that I have given on this subject. As the House is aware, the Act came into force on January 1 of last year, and, of course, the first six months was a period of preparation and investigation. But it seemed to me that some counties were interpreting the Act in rather too narrow a spirit, and I thought it advisable to issue a Circular to county councils. This I did on May 26 of last year, enclosing some model Rules to be adopted by county councils and by councils of county boroughs. I will read to your Lordships two short extracts from the Board's Circular and from the Rules which bear on the subject. In the Circular which I wrote, through the Secretary of the Board, to the different county councils I said&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0079"/>
<col>151</col>
<quote>"I am directed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to say that they are constantly receiving inquiries as to the correct interpretation of the words 'will themselves cultivate the holdings' which occur in Section 1 of the Small Holdings Act, 1892, and in Section 6 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1907, and the Board think it desirable, therefore, that they should state for the information of your Council what in their opinion is the practical effect of the words quoted. The question is one of considerable importance in view of the fact that if the words are construed in too narrow a spirit the effect might be to exclude from the benefits of the Acts a considerable number of applicants who desire to obtain land to be used as an adjunct to their present employment, and to limit the operation of the Acts to the provision of self-supporting small holdings the cultivation of which would occupy the whole time and attention of the holder. &#x2026; The Board are of opinion, therefore, that there is nothing in the Acts which would prevent a Council from providing holdings for those applicants who, while already engaged in some occupation, have sufficient spare time to be able to cultivate successfully a small holding. The experience of the past in many parts of the country shows that such men often succeed well as small holders, and the acquisition by them of small quantities of land as an adjunct to their present occupation frequently makes just the difference between bare subsistence and comparative prosperity. It is for this reason that many of the most successful small holdings in the country are to be found in districts where the surrounding agricultural conditions afford piece work of various kinds, or where there are in the neighbourhood mines or other industries which do not occupy the whole time of the workers. The Board think, therefore, that as a general rule a Council would not be justified in declining to accept applications from men who desire to obtain small holdings as an adjunct to their present occupation or in giving such applications a secondary place in their consideration as compared with those of men who propose to make their whole living off their holdings."</quote>
We also sent out model Rules as to small holdings for adoption by county councils and councils of county boroughs. I will only trouble your Lordships with the paragraph referring to the persons eligible to become purchasers or tenants and the paragraph as to the conditions under which holdings are to be held by tenants. The former runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The persons eligible to be purchasers or tenants of small holdings shall include every person who has informed the Council of his or her desire to acquire a small holding and has satisfied the Council of his or her ability to cultivate properly a small holding of the size and character desired. Provided that no person shall be eligible to be a purchaser or tenant of a small holding which with any holding already acquired or held by such person under the said Acts or otherwise would make up an area exceeding fifty acres, unless at the date of sale or letting the total annual value of the holdings for the purposes of income tax would not exceed &#x00A3;50."</quote>
<col>152</col>
The other Rule is that&#x2014;
<quote>"The tenant shall himself cultivate the holding and shall not use it for any purpose other than agriculture, horticulture, the keeping or breeding of live stock, poultry or bees, the growth of fruit, vegetables or the like, or other purpose of husbandry."</quote>
I can assure my noble friend that I have heard of no arbitrary desire on the part of the Board of Agriculture to justify any council in saying that they are acting under the inspiration of the Board in going outside the four corners of the Act.<lb/>
I will give to the House a case which came under my own personal observation. I visited a portion of Crown property in a village called Swine, in Yorkshire, not far from Hull. As we entered the village the driver of our motor-car sounded the hooter, and some cattle that were in the road promptly put up their tails and galloped off round the corner. I asked the boy in charge of the cattle why it was that they were on the road apparently to the common danger. "Oh," replied the boy, "they belong to some gentlemen in the village." I pointed out that that was no excuse, and asked why they were not in the fields. The lad said the owners of the cattle had no land of any sort or kind to put them on, and they were therefore obliged to pick up a livelihood at the side of the road. I saw the Crown tenants, and they seemed to have the whole of the parish, as it were, by the throat. The tenants had the whole of the land right up to the backs of the gardens of the houses, and in some cases right up to the houses themselves. I asked them whether it would be possible for them to give a small portion of the land to the unfortunate people who had cattle but nowhere to put them. The blacksmith's cow, for example, was kept in the woodshed, and as the woodshed was on higher ground than the blacksmith's shop the result was not very satisfactory. The tenants, with one exception, refused to give up any land, and therefore I had no option but to take land for these people. I took fourteen acres from a farm of 327 acres, three from a farm of 203 acres, three from a farm of 289 acres, nine and a half from one of 418 acres, and six from one of 362 acres&#x2014;thirty-five and a half acres in all out of a total of 1,599 acres. I need not say that there was a good deal of resentment in regard to this. The <i>Yorkshire Herald</i> described it as "East Riding Farmers victimised," and "Whole-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0080"/>
<col>153</col>
sale Mutilation of Farms." I think that is a somewhat exaggerated version of the proceeding, but that is the way in which persons in that part of the country looked upon that transaction. Of the people who wanted this land one was a small holder, another was a carrier, another a blacksmith, another a carpenter, another a groom, another a gardener, and the rest were farm labourers. I think that members of your Lordships' House, in your desire to give land to deserving persons and in your determination to carry out the law as it at present exists, would be the last body of men to grudge to a hard-working man, whether he be an agricultural labourer or a village artisan or tradesman, a small piece of land to supplement his income and make his life more comfortable. I think it is true to say that a small piece of land to an agricultural labourer makes the difference between a bare living and a comparatively comfortable existence. An accommodation holding would provide dairy produce for the man's family; it would give to a man who was in the butchering trade a run for the cattle he did not wish to slaughter for a day or so; it would give the higgler a place on which to put his horse; and in that way these worthy men might improve their position and raise themselves in that sphere of life in which Providence has placed them. I can assure my noble friend and the House that nothing illegal will be done as long as I am at the head of the Board of Agriculture, and that we will keep within the four corners of the Act, which I believe is doing a great deal of good to the agricultural community throughout the length and breadth of the land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00441"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lord, the concluding portion of the noble Earl's address to the House was interesting, and, as usual, full of picturesque detail, but it did not seem to me, I must own, strictly relevant to the Question put to him by my noble friend behind me. I do not wish to pursue that part of the case further, but I am anxious to ascertain from the noble Earl whether these Rules from which he has quoted have been or are likely to be published and made available to the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00442"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: All the county councils have received them. They have had them now for a considerable period.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00443"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It would be convenient that they should be circulated to members of your Lordships' House, who take a great interest in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00444"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Certainly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00445"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: So far as I was able to follow the extract which the noble Earl gave from the Rules, they seem to me to deal sensibly enough with the particular points raised by the noble Lord behind me. I understand the noble Earl to say that under these Rules applications for small holdings will not be entertained unless it can be shown that the applicant has sufficient spare time to cultivate a small holding, and not only that, but unless he is able to satisfy the council of his or her ability to cultivate. Now if those two conditions are insisted upon I think it is likely that any abuse of the Act will be effectually prevented, and I must say that for my own part I attach, very great importance to this. The object of our small holdings legislation was to restore, if we could possibly do so, a part of the rural population to the land&#x2014;that is, to set them up as <i>bona fide</i> agriculturists. That object would not be attained if small parcels of land were granted indiscriminately to applicants, whether they were likely to take up the profession of agriculturists themselves or not. There is another point which has to be considered. In many cases land has to be taken for this purpose from farmers who are already in occupation of it. I am sure the noble Earl will bear me out when I say that farmers do not desire to obstruct the policy of small holdings. At the same time they will, beyond all doubt, greatly resent having land taken from them if the land is used for some purpose other than that for which they were led to believe the Small Holdings Act was passed. Those are points of which we ought not to lose sight, and I am very glad to hear from the noble Earl that the policy which I think would find favour with most of us on this side of the House is really the policy accepted by the Department over which he presides.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00446"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we pass from this discussion I wonder if the noble Earl would mind if I put to him one or two difficult problems which it has fallen to my lot to encounter in the administration of his Act. The noble
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0081"/>
<col>155</col>
Earl this afternoon explained to us the admirable way in which he had been able, on the Crown lands, to take some part of the land from the sitting tenants and give it to small holders whose different occupations he described, but he omitted altogether to tell us&#x2014;and the point is the most important one of all&#x2014;whether the tenants from whom he took the land were yearly tenants or held the land on a lease. The matter is of great importance, because you may get an area where one or two hundred acres are required from the sitting tenants for the purpose of placing small holders on the soil, and it is essential in order to be fair that all the tenants in a locality should give up some land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00447"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00448"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: But it may happen that some of the tenants hold on a lease, the remainder being only yearly tenants. What happens? Those tenants who are on a yearly lease give up their land because they know they are bound to do so according to the terms of the Act, but those who hold land on a four, five, or seven years lease can only be reached through the compulsory clause, which the county councils have to put in force. No doubt a county council can do that, but the point that arises is this, that the moment the compulsory clause is put into effect the tenant on the soil can claim far greater compensation than the man with only a yearly tenancy. Again, by whom is that compensation paid? It is not paid by the county council or by the landlord; it has to be put on the incoming tenant&#x2014;that is to say, the rent to the small holder has to be raised. So far as I am aware, there is no machinery in existence by which you can deal with a man holding land on a long lease and make him give up a portion of it at a reasonable price. This is rather a complicated point, and I trust that I have put it clearly to the noble Earl. If he could give us any information as to how we are to deal with tenants who have long leases and how county councils are to allocate in a proper manner the compensation due to those tenants, I should be indeed grateful.<lb/>
There is one other point which the noble Earl slightly evaded but which arises out of the Question standing on the Paper in the name of Lord Ebury&#x2014;namely, what is the right kind of tenant to place on the
<col>156</col>
soil. Farmers who have been asked to give up land have said over and over again, "We are prepared to give up land if in our place you will put <i>bona fide</i> agriculturists, but we do not see why we should be called upon to give up land if in our place you are going to put men who have very good trades already, and allow them to take up ours as well. We think that is unfair and shall try to resist it." As a landowner, my hands are very much tied in the selection of those persons who should be placed on the soil because we have no information from the Board of Agriculture as to whether they consider that a <i>bona fide</i> agriculturist should be the first person who should be considered. If the noble Earl could, in the first place, give us information as to how we are to deal with those tenants who have a long lease, and, secondly, inform us which kind of tenants should be selected&#x2014;whether <i>bona fide</i> agriculturists or individuals who have already some kind of occupation&#x2014;it would be of great value to those landlords who are trying to carry out the Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00449"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke has referred to two difficulties. He asked me whether the Crown tenants were on a yearly lease. Yes, that is so. They were yearly tenants, and so there was no difficulty. If they had been under a lease for a longer period there would have been great difficulty in getting the land, and, even if it had been obtained by compulsion by the county council, there would have been&#x2014;and properly so&#x2014;compensation to have been paid, and that would have increased the cost of the land and would have been a great obstacle in the way. Then the noble Duke asked me as to the right sort of tenant to put on the land. That is not a very easy question to answer. I suppose it is all left to the county councils, who are a very intelligent body of people and know the local circumstances. They must do the best they can in the difficult conditions. But I should think that a man who obtained his living absolutely and entirely from the soil would naturally have the first chance. I think it would be fair to give it to him, though I should like most earnestly to impress on the House that we do not intend to permit a man, because he has another occupation, to be debarred from getting the land to which he is entitled under the Act. I think that is the only answer I am able to give to the noble Duke. Of course, difficulties do
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0082"/>

The intention of the Act and of the noble Earl was to bring the people back to the land, but I take it he did not mean townspeople&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

As we all know, the object of the small holdings legislation has been to bring people back to
<col>158</col>
the soil and to increase the number of those on the land. To give to a tradesman who resides in a town or in the suburbs a small holding which he either does not cultivate himself or cultivates in connection with his own dwelling is not bringing people back to the soil; and in order that Parliament may be able to ascertain how far the objects of the Act are being carried out I think it would be very desirable, if it be possible, to discriminate between these various classes of holders.</membercontribution></p>

I confess I have some doubt myself as to how far it is possible to discriminate accurately between the two classes. When the noble Earl speaks of a tradesman living in a town, that is an easy enough classification; but when you come to the village blacksmith, or, as very often happens, the publican, I do not think it can be said that in giving him facilities to own land you are travelling in any way beyond the objects of the Act. It must be remembered that these small parcels of land are often worked to a considerable extent by the families of the small holder, and to that extent you are giving people a new interest in the land, and, in fact, keeping on the land those who might be brought up altogether divorced from it, and who would otherwise be likely to go straight away to the towns to earn their living there. I can only say from my own experience, living as I do in a county of small holdings, that I find that those who have some other industry make admirable small holders. They work their land very well, and really tend to form part of the agricultural community of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>RUSSIA AND PERSIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00463"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose "to ask His Majesty's Government whether it is a fact that Russian troops are advancing from Tabriz, and that other troops are being marshalled at Baku; whether the Government will state with what object these troops are being moved; whether it is not a fact that the Nationalist troops advancing from Kasvin and Kum respectively have been preserving public order at Resht and Ispahan to the complete satisfaction of the Consular representatives, and therefore, no fear need be entertained for the lives and property of the Europeans at Teheran."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00464">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I intended last Thursday asking the Question standing in my name, but, at the request of the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I postponed doing so until to-day. In the meantime the situation in Persia, or in the vicinity of Persia, has developed extensively and rapidly. I do not for a moment wish to impugn the good faith of Russia in any action she has taken or is now taking. Indeed, as regards Russian advance in Persia, there are two distinct parties in Russia itself. There are what are called the Reactionaries, who are practically synonymous with the Forward Party; there is also the party opposed generally to the Government and represented by the deputation from the Duma at present in this country, and only last Friday one of their number voiced very loudly his disapproval of any Russian advance in Persia. Therefore what I am saying is not animated by any hostile feeling towards Russia, or a desire to challenge her good faith.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00465">My immediate object in raising the question in your Lordships' House is to see that nothing is done which is likely to be detrimental to the setting up of some form of constitutional government in Persia, because I regard the preservation of the integrity of Persia as of the most vital importance to the well-being and safety of our Indian Empire.
<col>160</col>
I ask, What chance is there of any free Constitution being set up in Persia if the Russian forces advance to Teheran? You cannot in Persia set up a free Constitution under the bayonets of a Power who certainly in the past have shown some desire to acquire great interest in that country. The Russian Government, in the Circular Note which appears in <i>The Times</i> to-day, state distinctly that they make this advance for the purpose of protecting their own Legation and subjects and European Legations and institutions generally. I should like to ask whether our representative in Teheran has made any request for protection, and, if so, has His Majesty's Government considered the advisability of affording protection themselves, or are they content to entrust the British representative and the lives and property of British subjects in Persia to the protection of a foreign Power?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00466">My immediate object, as I have said, is to secure the setting up of a Constitution in Persia, and by so doing my ultimate object is to secure the prestige of our Indian Empire and the material interests of British Indian subjects in Persia. As we are aware, India at the present time is undergoing many difficulties. We have seen a great period of unrest, which we hope may have now ceased; but, at all events, it has been in existence. According to the best judges, that unrest has been due, I will not say entirely, but very largely, to the success of the Japanese over the Russians in the recent war. What will be the effect upon the Indian mind if now we show any weakness towards the Power which was defeated by Japan? As bearing upon that question, I would like to know whether any communications have passed between His Majesty's Government and the Indian Government in regard to our position in Persia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00467">One other question I should like to ask. In the Circular Note of the Russian Government, to which I have already referred, these words are used&#x2014;
<quote>"In this connexion we could not leave out of sight the fact that in the event of the Bakhtiari and revolutionaries entering Teheran the Russian and other European Legations and European institutions and subjects, as well as our road from Enzeli (on the Caspian Sea) to Teheran&#x2014;"</quote>
It is quite new to me that the Russian Government can claim to have any road in Persian territory, and I think it is a point upon which we ought to have some precise information from His Majesty's Government.</p>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0084"/>
<col>161</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00468"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord for having postponed his Question from Thursday. I will now endeavour to answer it. We have no information to the effect that Russian troops are advancing from Tabriz. The Russian Government have decided, however, to send a force from Baku to Enzeli, with orders to advance as far as Kasvin, which is eighty-six miles from Teheran.<lb/>
With regard to the quotation which has just been read, it occurs to me that when the word "road" is used it does not mean that the surface of the road is the property of Russia. What they desire to safeguard is the means of passing. There is, however, I understand, a possibility that these orders may be countermanded if negotiations which are proceeding with the leaders of the Bakhtiari and Nationalists are successful. The object of this measure&#x2014;and that really deals with the point which I mentioned just now&#x2014;would be to insure communication between Kasvin and the Caspian Sea. A further advance of a portion of this force would only take place if it became necessary to afford protection to foreign Legations, to the lives and property of Europeans, and to European institutions in Teheran. The commander of the troops is to receive categoric instructions to confine himself to the protection of foreign interests and to abstain from all interference in the internal struggle now in progress. On that the noble Lord asks whether there is any precedent for European interests being confided to a single European Power. I have not the knowledge of precedents which the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench has; but I should imagine that there are numerous precedents&#x2014;indeed, I think I could, if necessary, recall one or two in recent days.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord asks about the proceedings of the Nationalist troops advancing from Kasvin and Kum. On that I have to say that we have no very recent information as to the state of public order at Resht or at Ispahan. According to our latest reports, Resht had remained quiet, while at Ispahan the cases of disorder, robbery, and drunkenness became more numerous towards the end of the stay of the Bakhtiari tribesmen in the town, while the state of the neighbouring country and roads has been deplorably bad. His Majesty's Government have received no expression of opinion, favourable or otherwise, from their Consular representa-
<col>162</col>
tives in those two towns as to the manner in which order has been preserved there by the Nationalist or by the Bakhtiari forces. We think, therefore, that it is not possible to affirm with certainty that if the capital were occupied by those forces the lives and property of Europeans in Teheran could be regarded as safe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00469"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has not answered my question whether our representative at Teheran has asked for protection&#x2014;whether he is at all imbued with this great fear?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00470"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is a difficult question to answer, but I have no doubt that our representative there would affirm the statement which I made as to the fact that it would be quite impossible to assert with certainty that, in the event of an occupation, an occupation which, presumably, would be of a violent character, the lives and property of Europeans would be respected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00471"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: It seems a serious position that, without any direct demand made for protection, we are going to allow a great, a powerful, country to advance armed forces into a country where the situation is so critical at any time&#x2014;a situation His Majesty's Government take credit to have safeguarded, to a great extent, by the Anglo-Russian Convention. What has happened to that Convention? There is nothing about safeguarding lives and property in that Convention. Now, without any request by our own people, we are going to allow an armed force to enter Teheran. That is very serious indeed. I do not know what further steps will be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00472"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to enter into an argument with the noble Lord, but he will remember that, within the last few weeks we ourselves landed a force of Bluejackets at Bushire in the Persian Gulf in order to protect life and property there.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00499" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00500">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00501"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the object of the Bill to which I am going to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to-day is to create, or, rather, to provide for the creation of, small holdings and allotments in Scotland, a small holding being defined as a holding which either does not exceed &#x00A3;50 in rent or does not exceed fifty acres in extent. This Bill is identical with the one which your Lordships were so good as to accept from me last year, and its procedure&#x2014;in fact, I may say almost the whole Bill&#x2014;is identical with the Small Holdings Act of 1907 which applies to England. The procedure and details of that Act are very well known to your Lordships, and I explained this Bill to the House in some detail last year. Therefore on this occasion I hope it will not be necessary for me to trouble your Lordships at any very great length. I shall content myself, at this stage at all events, by simply presenting to your Lordships in skeleton the main principles of the Bill.<lb/>
<col>166</col>
The first five clauses contain the words which provide how schemes are to be framed, how they are to be originated, and how they are to be carried out. If your Lordships will look at the Bill you will see that two persons are to be appointed by the Board of Agriculture who are to be called the Small Holdings Commissioners. They are to be persons with a knowledge of agriculture, who, acting under the directions of the Board, are to ascertain the extent to which there is a demand for small holdings in the several counties, or would be a demand if suitable land were available. They are then to report to the Board and to state whether it is desirable in their opinion that a scheme should be made, and they may indicate the nature of the proposals which they consider ought to be embodied in the scheme. When the Board are of opinion that it is desirable that this should be done, the report is to be forwarded, with any modifications which the Board think desirable, to the county council, and it is then to be the duty of the county council to prepare one or more draft schemes; but if the county council decline to undertake this duty, or within six months after receiving the report fail to prepare a scheme, then the Board may direct the Commissioners to prepare one or more draft schemes. There is an alternative procedure. The county council itself, without waiting for the report, may initiate a scheme and may lay it before the Board in the same manner as the Commissioners can; and after due consideration, either of a scheme put forward by a county council or a scheme put forward by the Commissioners, the Board may confirm the scheme. After that it shall be the duty of the county council to carry it out, and if the county council fails in that duty the Board may order the Commissioners to carry the scheme into effect.<lb/>
Clause 6 provides that for the purpose of providing small holdings a county council may either purchase or hire land, voluntarily, if possible, and, if not, by compulsion. That differs from the English Act in this, that in the English Act there are no compulsory powers of purchase. I do not see what objection there can be to inserting in a Bill for providing small holdings a power to purchase. There is no obligation whatsoever to buy, but surely it is an advantage that a county council should have the power.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0087"/>
<col>167</col>
Under Clause 7 the county council may, for the purpose of small holdings, adapt the land for sale or letting, and the amount of money which they expend for that purpose will, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1892, be taken into consideration in fixing the rents. The expenses of the Board under this Bill are to be provided for by an account which is to be called the Small Holdings (Scotland) Account, and which is to consist of such moneys as may be voted by Parliament for this purpose. This your Lordships will find in Clause 18. Beyond that there are certain restrictions placed upon certain descriptions of land which may not be taken for this purpose. Those restrictions your Lordships will find in Clause 27. They are identical, I think, or very nearly identical, with a clause contained in the Bill which was put forward recently by the Scottish Office. At all events, I am sure there is no great discrepancy between the two.<lb/>
Now we come to the manner in which land may be taken by compulsion, either for purchase or hiring. That will be done by an order, which must be applied for in the first instance by the county council and which must be approved by the Board of Agriculture. Your Lordships will find those provisions in the First Schedule. The order is to be in a prescribed form. It must be published, and the Board, in cases where objection is taken to the order, must hold an Inquiry. And with regard to compulsory hiring, the order is to determine "the terms and conditions of the hiring other than the rent;" and, with regard to the rent, if that matter becomes a question of dispute it is to be settled by a valuer appointed by the Board. I think I have now given your Lordships, in skeleton, the principles of the Bill, with the exception of that part which relates to allotments, and on which I do not think I need detain your Lordships long at this moment. The purpose of those clauses is to make the law the same in Scotland as it has hitherto been in England. The Bill provides for the transfer of powers from the county council to the parish council, and in the event of the parish council not doing its duty with regard to allotments, then it is made imperative on the county council, and, failing the county council, on the Board, to see that those provisions are observed.<lb/>
<col>168</col>
I said that I would not detain your Lordships long on the provisions of the Bill, and I think I may conclude with a few remarks upon the main principles of the Bill. Your Lordships will observe that to the Board of Agriculture is entrusted the power of supervision under this Bill and of seeing that small holdings are provided. The Board under the Bill is given very extensive powers. It has the power of approving of the starting of schemes, of having schemes considered, and, when the details are concluded and arranged, of confirming them and seeing that they are carried out. It has the power of taking land by compulsion either for hiring or for purchase, and it has the appointment of the valuer who is concerned with the fixing of the rent. The advantage, as it seems to me, of having the Board of Agriculture in this position is this. The Board of Agriculture not only has professional advisers and also great experience in these matters, but is responsible to Parliament. Your Lordships will see in the Bill that when the Board of Agriculture takes away from the county council the power of carrying out an order&#x2014;that is in Clause 5, subsection (3)&#x2014;and when it makes an order directing the Commissioners to take the place of the county council and carry the scheme into effect, then that order has to be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after it is made. I lay great stress upon this, because by this procedure you avoid the practice&#x2014;the bad practice, as I think&#x2014;which is becoming more and more common, of setting up and establishing separate authorities independent of Parliament and very often not subject to the control of the law; and it seems to me that the Board of Agriculture, which is not independent and has nothing in the nature of a Land Court &#x2014;a thing which is, in my opinion, most objectionable&#x2014;is a proper body for being placed in control of small holdings.<lb/>
The next point to which I would call attention is that this Bill proceeds as far as possible on principles of mutual help and co-operation. Compulsion is avoided until it becomes absolutely necessary. It is said that the local authorities, the county councils, have been somewhat backward in carrying out these schemes of small holdings. Even if that were true, I cannot help thinking&#x2014;and I am sure the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture agrees with me&#x2014;that it is most desirable
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0088"/>
<col>169</col>
able to enlist on your side the local authorities, who know the facts, and who necessarily are better acquainted with local circumstances than any outside body could be. This has been the endeavour of the noble Lord (Earl Carrington) from the very first passing of his Bill, and I am glad to know that he thinks this action on his part has been justified by the event. My noble friend, as your Lordships know, does not hide his opinions under a bushel, and he not infrequently gives utterance to them on public platforms in a manner which is both instructive and amusing. In February of the present year, in the course of a speech at Slough, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have always kept in view the great advantages which would be gained if this Act were administered by men possessing local knowledge, both in the nature of the land to be cultivated and the character and ability of the applicants. I am no lover of bureaucratic methods, and I am satisfied that I could secure more and better practical results by enlisting the help of local representative men instead of attempting to do everything from Whitehall."</quote>
Of the many wise things my noble friend has said, he never said anything wiser than that. He went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"My policy in this matter was much criticised at the time, and I was told that I was a very simple-minded person indeed to believe that county councils would be able and could be trusted to carry out the provisions of an Act of Parliament so revolutionary in character. But, looking back at the work which has been done, I do not for a moment regret my decision."</quote>
The noble Earl proceeded to say that most of the county councils had done their work admirably, and I can only hope that he will instil that doctrine into his noble colleague (the Secretary for Scotland) who sits by his side.<lb/>
The way in which the English Act has been worked by the English county councils also had testimony borne to it only a few days ago by no less a person than the Prime Minister. Mr. Asquith quoted figures&#x2014;supplied, of course, by the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;in order to show how well this Act had worked. He said that of holdings which had been acquired by voluntary purchase or voluntary hiring by the end of June, 1908, there were 2,000 acres; at the end of March this year, 27,000 acres; and at the end of June no less than 36,000 acres. All that area, my Lords, had been acquired by voluntary arrangement and without the interference of any outside court or similar body.
<col>170</col>
But, besides that, 5,000 acres were already acquired where the Board of Agriculture had had recourse to compulsion. Assuming this to be correct&#x2014;and, of course, it is&#x2014;it shows that the English Act, working on this voluntary principle and avoiding compulsion as far as possible, has attained very considerable success. It has been said that the Scottish county councils did not carry out the Act of 1892. Exactly the same remark was made with regard to the English county councils. But those who say that because Scottish county councils may not have been very active in carrying out the Act of 1892, therefore they are unlikely to carry out the English Act if applied to Scotland, forget this, that until two years ago there was no. power of compulsion at all, and therefore if a county council was unable to obtain land voluntarily it was unable to purchase land at all.<lb/>
I will now say a few words as to the position of the small holder as it will be under the Bill. In the first place, he will have security of tenure which will very nearly amount to fixity. The county councils are empowered to hire land for fourteen or thirty-five years, and at the end of that term they are empowered, if they see fit, to renew the lease, so that any small tenant holding under this tenure has a tenure which really amounts to fixity. In the next place, if a small tenant has been unable to agree about his rent, he has a fair rent fixed by the valuer appointed by the Board. Again, under this Bill the small holder is treated on exactly the same terms as any other holder; and it stands to reason that if a small holding is a self-supporting mode of occupation it must rest upon its own merits and must not be supported by any outside advantages. In England at the present time small holders have to pay all the money spent upon the holdings by the public. What has been spent on their holdings is taken into consideration in fixing the rent. That is a perfectly sound and legitimate procedure, and I venture to think that it is the only procedure upon which small holdings can be justified. In my opinion it is by no means an economic principle upon which to conduct business that small holdings should be propped up by money taken from the taxes.<lb/>
Under the Bill all present contracts are left untouched. I appeal to noble Lords
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0089"/>
<col>171</col>
from Scotland whether in their knowledge there are not many small holders who at the present time are not only perfectly satisfied with the conditions of their tenure but who would be extremely indignant if they found that by some Bill or another they were deprived of their present tenure. If, however, they are not content with their present tenure, then their course would be to give up the holding and apply for a small holding under this Bill. I have now concluded all that it is necessary to trouble your Lordships with at this stage, and I ask you to give a Second Reading to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00503"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of the Government I welcome this Bill and the discussion which it brings. Nobody can be in any doubt as to the question being one of great importance, and any evidence is welcome that your Lordships' House recognises the importance of increasing the number of small farmers and small holdings in this country and thereby promoting the growth of the rural population. For my part I consider this one of the most vital questions that Parliament can discuss at the present time.<lb/>
If history teaches us anything, it is that no great country can long survive the decay of its rural population, and when I reflect that we are behind nearly every other country in Europe in the proportion which our rural population bears to the rest of our population, I cannot help believing that it is high time that Parliament should attend to this subject. Taking the United Kingdom as a whole we have a smaller rural population, we have a smaller percentage of people employed in agriculture, than is the case in any one of the great nations which compete with us. We are not even making the best of our own resources. During the last twenty years&#x2014;of course, statistics can be multiplied on this question, but I do not wish to trouble you with more than one or two to emphasise the importance of the subject&#x2014;during the last twenty years something like two million acres of land in the United Kingdom have gone out of cultivation; in Germany, on the other hand, they have added three-quarters of a million acres to their cultivated area; and in Denmark they have added about a
<col>172</col>
million and a quarter. And if you look at the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture you find that whereas in the United States there are 1,500 to every 10,000, and in Germany something like 1,400, in this country, in the year 1901, there were only 495, as compared with 711 some twenty years before. In these circumstances the importance of the question cannot be denied, and I am glad that this House sees fit, at the instance of the noble Earl opposite, to give a short time to its consideration.<lb/>
The subject opens a very wide field, but I will follow the noble Earl in his example of brevity, not because there is not much to say which is of importance, but because your Lordships are familiar with the subject. You have frequently debated it in recent years, and I will therefore confine myself to discussing this Bill on its merits and indicate briefly one or two reasons why I believe it is not a workable scheme. I join in congratulating my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture on the success of his measure for England. That is a proof that the Government recognise the importance of this question. There are legislative proposals in regard to land for Ireland now before Parliament, and your Lordships are familiar with the legislation which has been attempted on this subject for Scotland. I notice two directions in which the noble Earl who moved this Bill seems to have advanced upon the position taken up not very long ago. He emphasised one himself in introducing the Bill to the notice of your Lordships&#x2014;namely, that he has added compulsory powers of purchase to the former proposal. I notice this other feature. Your Lordships may recollect that the Government's proposals were severely criticised for not recognising the difference between the crofter districts of Scotland and the Lowlands. The noble Earl follows our example. The machinery of his Bill is applicable to the whole of Scotland from North to South, and in that I agree with the noble Earl.<lb/>
So far as I can discover, the principle upon which this Bill is based is that what is good for England must necessarily be good for Scotland. I believe that is a sound Unionist doctrine, but it is not the principle that has built up the British Empire; it is not the principle which has conciliated Ireland, and it is apt to be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0090"/>
<col>173</col>
misleading even when it is applied to Scotland. Look at the experience of Scotland. Take the Small Holdings Act of 1892. In England it has had some operation. Nine county councils&#x2014;very few, I admit&#x2014;worked the Act to the measure of supplying something like 800 acres for small holdings. In Scotland, with the exception of one instance&#x2014;Ross-shire&#x2014;where twenty-five holdings and a total area of eighty-five acres were provided, the Act has been an absolute and entire failure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00504"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Forfarshire on two or three occasions asked for applications, but received none.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00505"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I know. I was going on to argue that the very fact of the failure which the noble Earl quotes shows the unwisdom of proceeding on the same lines in the Bill now before the House. I will ask the noble Earl also to look at the operations of the Allotments Act which has worked hand in hand with the Small Holdings Act in the two countries. In Scotland under 200 people have received allotments, whereas in England nearly 50,000 tenants have been created under the Allotments Act. Is that not significant of the wide distinction between England and Scotland? Is it not remarkable that the same legislation should have had no operation in Scotland whereas it has had very considerable operation south of the border?<lb/>
Then may I remind your Lordships that the farming habits and customs are completely different in the two countries? Take the conditions of work of the labourer. In Scotland he is a half-yearly or a yearly servant; he gives his whole time to the farm, and lives in a cottage on the farm; he has grazing for a cow, and, if he is unmarried, he lives either in the bothy with other unmarried men or with a relative in one of the cottages. His whole time is given to the working of the farm under the direction of the farmer. In England, broadly speaking, the conditions of the farm labourer are entirely different. He lives in the village, renting his own house. He is hired by the month, week, or day. He does not give his whole time, and he is obliged, and anxious, to supplement the wages which he receives from the farmer by working on some allotment or small garden ground, whatever he is able to secure. The conditions of the two men are
<col>174</col>
wholly different. If it is from any class in particular that you are to rear up a race of small holders it is from the farm labourer class who have gained experience in farming; but their conditions are entirely different in the two countries.<lb/>
What is the bearing of this difference upon the endeavour to create small holdings? It is this, that the wants of the two men are widely different. Whereas in England the man wants an allotment or garden ground which is accessible from his own house and on which he can labour in the evening, in Scotland the farm servant, as we call him, wants nothing of the kind. What he wants is a small holding upon which he can live and make his home&#x2014;anything up to 100 acres. According to the quality of the land the size of the farm must vary. There are plenty of ambitious, industrious, enterprising farm servants in Scotland who are willing and anxious to invest their savings in this manner provided they can be given a proper opportunity. In Aberdeenshire there are more than 5,000 holdings under twenty acres and 4,000 up to the limit of 100 acres. There are between 9,000 and 10,000 small holders in Aberdeenshire, the most successful farming county in Scotland, under the limit of 100 acres, and it is the same in other counties to a less degree. Berwickshire, Midlothian, and Roxburgh-shire are conspicuously counties of large farms, yet there is a total of over 1,200 of the smaller size farms under twenty acres, and 500 from twenty to 100 acres. In every county of Scotland there are these men, and it is in that direction that the ambitions, the needs, and the hopes of the Scottish farm servant lie.<lb/>
But it is a very different matter to equip an allotment in England&#x2014;and the large demand in England is for allotments&#x2014;and, on the other hand, a small holding in Scotland. The equipment for an allotment is a tool shed and a fence at the most, whereas in Scotland you require fencing, adaptation possibly, roads, a house, farm buildings, and all the rest of it. You propose by this Bill to lay upon county councils the duty of working out these schemes. The small holder will not take your small holding unless, in the first place, it is offered to him at a fair rent. I say it is quite impracticable, so far as such examination of this Bill as I have been able to give it shows me, for a county council

to do the work which the noble Earl seeks to lay upon it. The cost is too great.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00508"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I shall be very glad to follow the suggestion of the noble Lord and meet his argument. The noble Lord is aware, of course, that under Lord Camperdown's Bill&#x2014;the noble Earl himself stated it very clearly&#x2014;this is not to be a charity business. All expenses of acquiring and adapting the land to small holdings are to be recouped to the county council in the form of rent. We all know that the great difficulty in the creation of small holdings has been the expense of buildings. In many cases there has been no desire to withhold land or to prevent its being broken up into small holdings. The real truth has been that owners of land have not been able to afford to do so. The cost of the buildings makes the whole thing prohibitive. They could not lose money upon it. They have, therefore, declined to do it. Is it conceivable that a county council is going to carry out this business of going into the market, purchasing land, equipping it, and adapting it for small holdings at a lower cost than a private individual? I have yet to learn that that has ever been done, or is likely to be done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00509"><member>LORD LEITH of FYVIE</member><membercontribution>: It can be done in a business way&#x2014;in the same way as it has been done before, and as we would propose to do it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00510"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That is a matter of opinion, and, with the greatest respect to the House, I am expressing my opinion and giving reasons which induce me to hold that opinion. I do not believe that it is a practicable proposition. Obviously no men will come forward to take small holdings unless they can be let at a fair rent and one which will enable them to live and work and thrive upon the holdings. When you take into consideration the expenses which have to be thrown into the rent, you are faced with two alternatives. You must
<col>176</col>
either fix the rent of the holding at a figure which will attract no offers, or you must subsidise the rent, which is forbidden in the noble Earl's Bill, from the rates&#x2014;a proceeding to which I should have myself the very greatest objection. I do not understand the motives or the intentions with which the scheme in this Bill has been framed, but in my humble judgment it is an absolutely unworkable scheme.<lb/>
May I remind your Lordships that this is not a difficulty which I have conjured up in order to criticise the noble Earl's Bill? It is a difficulty that the Government were obliged to face in the Bill which they had the honour of laying before Parliament. We were obliged to face this difficulty, and we faced it with some support from experience which cannot be said to be the case in this instance. I do not propose to trespass upon the House by discussing the Government's proposals or defending them in any sense, but I may remind your Lordships that the way we met this difficulty was to provide funds by which the cost of adaptation should be borne by the Exchequer. Believing, as we did, the provision of small holdings to be a vital necessity, recognising that it was not fair to lay upon the landowner the cost of the adaptation of the land for use as small holdings, and recognising, further, that you could not lay upon the small holder the cost of adaptation without obliging him to sit at a rent which would be unfair, we provided funds by which the cost of adaptation was to be borne, in part, at any rate, by the community. Conceiving that this was an object of national concern, we provided the funds by which this difficulty could be met. Your Lordships may read in the Reports of the Congested Districts Board instance after instance in which tenants have been placed upon land in Scotland by the operation of precisely the methods which I have described, as exercised now by the Congested Districts Board. Something like 900 small holdings have been created in Scotland by our system, which is more, I think, than can be said&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00515"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Some of the people who are now crofters may have been cottars. Some quite successful crofters may have been cottars. I have yet to learn that it is any disgrace to live in one part of Scotland more than another, and to be called a crofter rather than a small holder. In essence, I submit, they are the same people if they are living and working under the same conditions.<lb/>
If your Lordships will allow me, I will put one or two other objections, which seem to me obvious, to this Bill. In the crofter districts to which the noble Lord has alluded and in the neighbouring districts where for years the small holders have looked forward to obtaining for themselves the protection of the Crofters Acts, the noble Earl by his Bill proposes to run, side by side with the machinery which there exists, a system of creating small holdings by the county councils and the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. You are, therefore, to have in the same counties two separate sets of machinery for creating small holdings&#x2014;one which the people know, of which they recognise the benefits, working through the Crofters Commission and the Congested Districts Board, which has, as I say, in the last twelve years created 900 holdings of this kind by purchase and by tenancy schemes, and, on the other hand, the system set up by the machinery of the noble Earl's Bill. Apart from its impracticability, on its merits, as applying anywhere in Scotland, it is not, I think, likely to have any operation whatever in the Highland counties. I have not said a word about the question of compensation, but if I were not trespassing on your Lordships' indulgence I would say that the question of compensation, the question of the freedom of cropping, must be considered when schemes for the establishment of small holdings are framed. I do not think that in these respects the scheme in this Bill is likely to meet with success, and, further, it is obvious that a scheme of this kind, involving the ownership of land in every county of Scotland by the county council, is likely to be most costly to work. For these and other reasons I shall be compelled, if the noble Earl presses his Bill to a vote, to record my vote against it.<lb/>
<col>178</col>
I do not believe that this Bill&#x2014;and it has been before the country for some time&#x2014;has any support whatever in Scotland. The Government Bill was originally introduced in July, 1906. Ten months at least elapsed before the English Bill, upon which this Bill is founded, was brought forward. During the whole of that period there was never a suggestion in Scotland, though there was much criticism of the Government Bill, that the work of creating small holdings should be committed to the county councils; nor do I think there is any hope of progress whatever on those lines. For myself I can say truly that I am willing to consider any proposals dealing with this subject; but it is not enough to pass Bills into law; they must be framed to meet the end in view after considering the whole of the circumstances bearing upon the case. If proposals are to succeed, they must be framed with regard to the conditions of the problem.<lb/>
There is one step gained in the appearance of this Bill&#x2014;the noble Earl is now willing, or seems to be willing, to legislate for Scotland as a whole. But in so doing you must not ignore either the failure of the Small Holdings Act or the Allotments Act in Scotland or the existence of the crofter system in that country&#x2014;the largest small holding system in operation in these Islands. I believe an increase in the number of small holders is vital to us as a country; and in providing them you must see that by the provisions of your scheme your small holder has security of tenure, a fair rent fixed by an independent tribunal or one in which he has confidence, compensation for his improvements, and freedom to use to the utmost for himself and in the interests of the community his capital, his labour, and his intelligence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00516"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with interest to the speech that has just been delivered by the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, and I confess that, in my view, his criticisms of my noble friend's Bill have been remarkably weak. He seems to me to have brought out hardly any point against the Bill except that no money is provided. But the noble Lord's own Bill only provided &#x00A3;65,000 for small holdings, and I think that sum would have produced hardly one small holding per annum in each county in Scotland. The noble Lord then made a great point of the difference in the conditions
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0093"/>
<col>179</col>
of small holders in England and in Scotland. That is perfectly right. They do exist under thoroughly different conditions in the two countries. In Scotland the farm servant is hired for a particular period which gives him security for his labour, and if he is a careful man he saves money and looks forward to the time when he will himself take a croft or small holding. Personally I am always very glad to welcome these men when they come to me and ask for a croft. It is not always possible, however, to comply with their request, but when an opportunity occurs they are always the men who are selected for these crofts. That is the way in which farmers are made. When a man becomes a crofter he does not intend to remain a crofter. The labourer becomes a crofter; he then goes on to a small holding, and so on. That is the case not only in Aberdeenshire, but throughout the whole of Scotland. Indeed, I do not see that in the speech of the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland there was any real criticism of the Bill now before the House. It is true that in Scotland the labourer is provided with a house and in many cases also with a certain quantity of food, but that is always taken into consideration in the wages paid. The provision of a house is part of the labourer's wages. Another criticism was that there would be under the Bill two systems of acquiring land in the different counties. The areas which both bodies&#x2014;the Congested Districts Board and the county council&#x2014;look after are very well defined, and there would be absolutely no difficulty in carrying out the work of both bodies side by side. As showing how much the people in Scotland appreciated the Bill which the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland introduced in the House of Commons but which was rejected in your Lordships' House, I have had more than one man come to me with a desire to take a small holding and ask whether I could not make the acreage a little more or the rent a little larger so that he would not come under the Bill. That has happened on three or four occasions, and if that is the case in one part of Scotland I have no doubt it is the same in other parts. I must say I thoroughly support Lord Camperdown's Bill. In spite of what the Secretary for Scotland has said, I think that it is a most workable Bill, and that county councils when they got to understand its provisions would, if it were passed, take it up most heartily and do their utmost
<col>180</col>
to carry it into effect. My opinion is that the majority of small holders and farmers would greatly prefer to have the two Bills which have been introduced by Lord Camperdown and Lord Lovat to the cumbrous arrangements in the measure of the Secretary for Scotland. I therefore hope your Lordships will support the Second Reading of the Bill now before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00517"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who spoke from the Front Bench opposite began his remarks by according a welcome to my noble friend's proposals so cordial, almost glowing in its terms, that I began to hope that His Majesty's Government were, after all, going to relent, and to see that my noble friend's proposals contained features in many respects preferable to their own. But as he went on he proceeded to damn my noble friend's Bill in the most emphatic terms.<lb/>
Now although I fully realise that, in view of the attitude of His Majesty's Government, there is no prospect whatever of this Bill being persevered with in another place, I am glad that my noble friend has taken another opportunity of putting on record views entertained by himself, and, I believe, by many other members of the House, as to the manner in which this small holdings question should be dealt with in Scotland. We agree with the noble Lord opposite in holding that the question is one of very great importance; and we are ready to deal with it, and to deal with it upon lines which we conceive to be eminently just, reasonable, and practical lines; and I say that the more confidently because the principles upon which this Bill is based are, after all, the same principles upon which the English legislation so warmly supported by His Majesty's Government was also based. It seems to me, so far as principle is concerned, that it is really impossible for His Majesty's Ministers to challenge the soundness of the grounds upon which my noble friend is proceeding.<lb/>
What is the first principle on which my noble friend relies? It is, I think, this, that the duty of providing these small holdings is one which, in the first instance, belongs to the local authorities of the country, acting under the general supervision and direction of the central Government. My noble friend quoted with much effect the utterances of the President of the Board of Agriculture in regard to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0094"/>
<col>181</col>
the importance of obtaining the co-operation of the county councils. Only last night, if my memory serves me, he ended his speech by once again expressing the great obligations under which he lay to the county councils for the manner in which they had given effect to the policy of the English Small Holdings Act. We remain of opinion that, as a matter of principle, it is better to rely upon the existing local authorities of the different parts of the United Kingdom rather than to set up new tribunals with autocratic powers&#x2014;tribunals of a kind which, as my noble friend pointed out, we are very fond in these days of setting up, for one purpose or another, by different Statutes.<lb/>
There is another principle upon which my noble friend relies&#x2014;one which seems to me to be of the utmost importance. My noble friend insists upon the fundamental distinction between a crofter and a small holder. I heard with bewilderment the statement made by the noble Lord a few moments ago to the effect that crofters and small holders were in essence the same. I say, on the contrary, that in essence they are different. The noble Lord has been concerned in the affairs of Scotland for a long time, and surely he must know by now that the crofter is a man who finds himself on a small lot which has probably been occupied by his predecessors in title for many generations&#x2014;a small lot on which the improvements have been executed by the man himself and by his predecessors. Their position is wholly exceptional. It is entirely different from the position of the farmer as we know him in other parts of the United Kingdom. I say by all means, where you find these crofters deal with them as tenderly and as justly as you can. But I say do not go out of your way to extend the crofter system where it does not already exist. We have it in evidence from numerous sources that the crofter system has led to agriculture more miserable and to conditions of existence more squalid and wretched than any other system with which we are familiar in these islands, and it seems to me, I must say, midsummer madness to endeavour to spread that system where it does not exist already.<lb/>
There is a third principle which underlies my noble friend's proposals. He desires, while giving ample opportunities for the creation of small holdings where they
<col>182</col>
do not exist and where they are required, not to break down the existing Scottish agricultural system; and, my Lords, surely we are not wrong in saying that the Scottish agricultural system is not one of which any country need be ashamed. It has led to cultivation of the soil more scientific and more successful probably than any which we know in any other part of the United Kingdom, and I have never been able to see what arguments could be advanced in favour of breaking down that system and of introducing sporadically, here and there, little patches of that system of Irish land tenure of which we have had such disastrous experience in other parts of the United Kingdom&#x2014;a system which, pray let us not forget it, Parliament is at this moment endeavouring to put an end to by means of a very large expenditure from public funds.<lb/>
I also notice with pleasure in this Bill those provisions which are designed to facilitate, not only the hiring of land for small holdings, but also the creation of a proprietary right in such holdings. That has always seemed to me to be one of the objects at which our land legislation should aim, and I have always regretted that it should have been studiously put on one side in the measures lately proposed by His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
The noble Lord, in his criticism of my noble friend's Bill, dwelt upon the fact that in some respects Scottish agriculture and the conditions of agricultural life in Scotland differ from those which obtain in this country. I have no doubt they do. The noble Lord told us particularly that whereas in England we had agricultural labourers living in cottages provided for them, in Scotland you have what is known as the bothy system, and farm servants hired by the year or by the half-year; and he has a great desire that some means should be found for enabling the more deserving members of that class to establish themselves upon the land. I entirely agree with him, but then I say my noble friend's Bill contains clauses which are intended for that very purpose. If the noble Lord will look at the second and third clauses, I think they are, of the Bill, he will see that elaborate machinery is set up for enabling small holdings to be provided for these and other deserving members of the community.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0095"/>
<col>183</col>
The noble Lord went on to say that the question of equipment stands in Scotland on an entirely different footing from what it does in England. He said that in England the question of equipment very often resolved itself merely into the provision of a tool shed, whereas in Scotland a much more substantial and expensive equipment in the shape of buildings and fences and so forth was necessary. But does the noble Lord suppose that the equipment difficulty does not exist in England also? Your Lordships remember very well some discussions we had in this House, I think two years ago, upon the alleged failure of many of the local authorities to give effect to the Small Holdings Act. What was the difficulty that was pleaded&#x2014;pleaded, I have no doubt, with absolute honesty&#x2014;by the different local bodies? The difficulty that they pleaded was that the great expense of providing equipment was the main obstacle they had to overcome in dealing with the provision of small holdings. That I am sure, is within the memory of the House.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, I understand, proposed to solve the difficulty by a grant from the Exchequer. My recollection is that the total amount of the grant proposed was something like &#x00A3;65,000 a year&#x2014;an amount which, when you had sub-divided it amongst the different claimants, and after they had been provided with suitable homes in which to live, would not, I venture to think, have left a very large margin for other kinds of equipment. But be that as it may. The real difference between the policy of the noble Lord opposite and the policy of my noble friend behind me is not that the one policy is based upon subventions from public funds and the other is not. The real difference between the two is that the system which we prefer on this side is a system which has been tried, which has succeeded and can be made to succeed, whereas the other, in our view, is a new and dangerous experiment likely to have most unfortunate results upon Scottish agriculture, and likely to work with the utmost injustice both to the owners and occupiers of land in that country. If my noble friend goes to a Division I shall very gladly give him my vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00518"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to say much, because I look upon this as a very barren controversy, and I am afraid
<col>184</col>
that it will remain so as long as the majority of this House take the view of, and the attitude towards, ministerial policy which they now take. Although reminiscences are by no means agreeable and are very often not useful, let me say a word or two by way of reminiscence. That the subject is of immense importance no one can dispute, because the people of Scotland are more and more, and in a rapidly increasing volume, emigrating from Scotland and from the agricultural parts of Scotland. There is no doubt about that, and it is an evil which everyone is anxious to remedy. For the first time during the last fifteen years, when we came into office we proposed a Bill dealing with the subject. Your Lordships will recollect it. It was met by Lord Rosebery with the objection that what was wanted was a purchase scheme and not a hiring scheme at all. Now, there is no authority in Scotland who will say that, and I believe that the noble Earl who moved this Bill will not say it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00519"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00520"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Yet it was received with great acceptance in this House, and it was one of the main reasons, only eighteen months ago, for the refusal of your Lordships to even give a Second Reading to our Bill. The second objection of Lord Rosebery was that it was an insult&#x2014;a gross insult, I think he said&#x2014;to the county councils of Scotland. Does the noble Earl know of a single county council in Scotland which has expressed its desire to have these powers? Not one. Yet that was the spirit in which honest proposals to try and meet this problem were met. After that I appealed to the House. I was acting in concert with my colleague the Secretary for Scotland, and I went through a painful, tedious analysis of the English clauses and the Scottish Bill, and I told you that I was prepared to try and meet every difficulty that could arise by any Amendment that with reason I could accept. I said that I would do my best to meet the views of noble Lords on this subject&#x2014;I did not say that without meaning it, for, as I have said, I was acting in conjunction with my colleague the Secretary for Scotland&#x2014;but the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, sword in hand, followed by his supporters, boarded our ship and asked us to scuttle our own vessel. I admit the grace with which he did it, but the end was that a
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0096"/>
<col>185</col>
Second Reading was refused to our measure.<lb/>
Now the noble Earl brings in his Bill. I congratulate him upon one or two things. In the first place, I congratulate him upon having in this measure agreed to the fixation of fair rents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00521"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: It was in last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00522"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am glad that it is in the Bill again this year. I congratulate the noble Earl also upon having agreed to fixity of tenure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00523"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No; security of tenure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00524"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It is a perpetually renewable provision; it is security of tenure for ever, and that is fixity enough. I also congratulate the noble Earl on something uncommonly like the creation of a fair-rent Court. It is not a Court which always consists of the same persons, but there is a valuer who has complete control to fix the rent himself without appeal. I congratulate my noble friend upon that. It is something to think we have got so far.<lb/>
I now come to the characteristic differences on which the noble Marquess relied &#x2014;the differences between what you would not even examine eighteen months ago and what you welcome with alacrity now. This policy of having to go to the county councils is not desired in Scotland. It is not desired by the county councils, it is not desired by the people of Scotland, and it is only because the provision is in the English Act that now you want to insert it in the Scottish measure. But the provision in the noble Earl's Bill enables the county councils to be overriden by a bureaucratic central department. Those, however, are only matters of detail which in connection with the former Bill, if you had only been prepared to allow it to be considered, we could have discussed in Committee.<lb/>
I agree also with the noble Marquess that crofters are different from small holders, but when one speaks of crofters as men on small patches of soil cultivated by needy people, hardly able to subsist in the remote and desolate parts of the
<col>186</col>
Highlands, the conception presented is that you do not want to increase this misery. Of course not. The real point, however, is not the question whether crofters should be placed in other parts of Scotland, but of giving security of tenure. The truth is that people seem to be alarmed at the idea of crofterising Scotland. We do not desire to crofterise Scotland, nor to compel the people to purchase their land&#x2014;because they have not the money to do this&#x2014;but to give reasonable tenure and fixity of tenure with some method of ascertaining fair rents in a method which would be conformable to the customs and habits of the people. We should not try to import county councils where no one wants them and where they would not really be of service.<lb/>
As regards the proposals of the noble Earl, I am afraid they offer no prospect of success, for instead of accommodating your legislation to the wishes of the Scottish people, the noble Earl wishes to accommodate it to the English precedent. I do not know whether the noble Earl remembers it, but in the amusing "Letters of Malachi Malagrowther" Sir Walter Scott gives numerous reasons why the laws of Scotland should not be always assimilated to the laws of England. Why should they be the same? With all respect I ask whether it is not pedantry if a system has nothing wrong in it to refuse to give it to Scotland because the same scheme does not exist in England? I think I have fairly put the points of difference between us. Is it not rather, I will not say a scandal, but a reproach that, eighteen months after having refused even to discuss the proposals of the Government, noble Lords are now discussing the same subject under different proposals and without having been able to come to any accommodation, because one of the great points of difference still remains unsettled? Your Lordships say you will have it either by means of purchase or by means of the county council; but you will not allow it to be settled in the way in which the Scottish people think most useful. There is no principle in it. It is, if I may say so, nothing but obduracy which prevents this business from being, as it ought to be, settled.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00525"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words in reply. I have been very
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0097"/>
<col>187</col>
much struck by the speech which has just been delivered, because it is so entirely different in its tone from the speech which the noble and learned Lord delivered last year. He was then endeavouring to induce your Lordships to give a Second Reading to the Bill of the Government, and he tried to persuade us by every means in his power&#x2014;and he has, as we know, great powers of fascination and of cajoling the House&#x2014;that these two Bills were very much the same. He said that fixity of tenure is very little more than what we had proposed, that the fixation of fair rents was to be found in both Bills, and so on. He said that, after all, there is not very much difference between a county council possessing purchasing powers, and so on, which are put in force by the Board of Agriculture, and a Court which has to fix fair rents. It is just there that the whole difference lies. The noble and learned Lord even went so far as to assure us that this Court, which was to be entirely independent of law, to be above all law and not responsible in any way to Parliament, and which was to have the most absolute powers of doing whatever it chose &#x2014;that this really was no very great advance. It is just there that we meet him. We say, What is the reason for setting up an independent land Court? After all, if the noble and learned Lord is right, and if there is really not very much difference between the land Court and the procedure proposed in this Bill, pray why is the noble and learned Lord so obdurate, if I may use his own phrase, as to refuse to accept the terms in this Bill?<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord said that I had made great advances. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland said the same thing. Certainly. We have made all the advances that we possibly can in the direction of the proposals of His Majesty's Government. If this Bill became law Scottish county councils would, for the first time, have the power of hiring land by compulsion, and I am sure that the members of the county councils would do their best to carry out the provisions of the Bill. Turning to what was said by the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, I must admit to being a little perplexed by his criticism; and a person who, I think, must be more perplexed than I am is the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, who is sitting at this moment so peacefully at his side. I am
<col>188</col>
surprised that the noble Earl did not at once rise to defend his bantling the English Act. Did the noble Earl hear his colleague say that England requires allotments, not small holdings; that Scotland requires small holdings, not allotments? Does the noble Earl agree with that? And did he hear his colleague say that the whole system of compensation in his Act is wrong, that the systems of cropping are most unsatisfactory, and that they will not do for Scotland?<lb/>
Then the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland made an assertion which has just been contradicted from the Woolsack. He said that there was nothing about fair rents in this Bill. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack knows better. He knows that there is fixation of fair rents in the Bill, and if the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland would only read the Bill he would see that it is so. Then there was another still more surprising assertion which the noble Lord made, and which I do not think is altogether complimentary to Scotland. He said that in Scotland you cannot set up a small holding without providing for its adaptation out of the taxes. Does the noble Lord really mean that? It seemed to me quite inconsistent with another remark he made &#x2014;namely, that there were a great many farm labourers who had saved money and were ready to take up small holdings but only wanted the land. Why could not they put a portion of their savings into the equipment of the small holdings?<lb/>
The noble Lord naturally got on to his Bill, and he said that in his Bill provision had been made in this direction. Does the noble Lord remember how much that provision amounted to? He provided a total of &#x00A3;65,000 to be spread over the whole area of Scotland. That sum was all that there was to provide buildings and equipment. The noble Lord, although he offered the equipment as a gift, did not go so far as to include the buildings. I would ask your Lordships, supposing this desire for small holdings to be as general as the noble Lord says, and supposing also that his Bill worked with the celerity which he imagines it would&#x2014;I think, however, it would be found very different when put into practice&#x2014;and that a large number of small holdings were created and a large sum of money required for buildings and
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0098"/>
<col>189</col>
equipments, how far would &#x00A3;65,000 go? Not very far. I think he would have found that there would have been a general complaint at once all over the country from small holders who had been led to believe that the noble Lord was going to equip their holdings.<lb/>
The noble Lord said that this Bill of mine creates two different systems. Yes, it does. But there are two different sets of people&#x2014;one the crofters and the other the small holders. The greater part of, the noble Lord's crofters are people whose crofts do not amount to &#x00A3;5 a year, and even then, as he knows, they do not pay their rent. But the small holder is a different person altogether, and should be dealt with by a different procedure. The crofter is a person whose rent may rise as high as &#x00A3;30; a small holder's rent may rise as high as &#x00A3;50. Therefore it seems to me that, so far from its being any disadvantage to a crofter, it is a great advantage to him that there should be two systems, because if he has enough money to start a small holding he can then apply to the county council for one and get it. The noble Lord said that my plan would prove most costly. I wish lie had gone on to tell us where all this cost was going to arise which would not necessarily arise under any other proposal. He also said the Bill was unworkable. Well, assertions are not arguments, and I must say I did not hear in the course of the noble Lord's speech anything to establish either of those last two propositions. I shall certainly ask your Lordships to read the Bill a second time. It represents what in my opinion, and, I believe, in the opinion of many noble Lords on this side of the House, is a good and workable system of small holdings for Scotland. At all events, I hope that the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, whichever way he votes upon it, will not say again, as he did the other day, that this House had stopped all proposals for the creation of small holdings in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00556"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether the Territorial Force is intended to be able to meet an invasion in the absence of the striking force, or only a raid; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00557">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in putting this Question to my noble friend and in moving my Motion, I have no intention or desire to occupy much of your Lordships' time. I do not think it can be said with justice or truth that there is any assembly more well disposed towards, and who have done more by individual action for, the Territorial Force than your Lordships' House, and therefore my Question cannot in any way be considered as casting suspicion upon either the success of or our good wishes towards the Territorial Force. But it is undoubtedly true that within the last eighteen months the purpose for which the Territorial Force was created has assumed a much more ambitious character.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00558">My right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War recently made two very
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0100"/>
<col>193</col>
important statements in regard to what he considers to be the purpose of the Territorial Force. In explaining the Army Estimates in February, 1908, my right hon. friend said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial Army is designed to free the Regular Army from the necessity of remaining in this island, to fulfil the functions of home defence, and to permit greater freedom to the Navy";</quote>
and speaking at General Baden-Powell's lecture at the Royal United Service Institution in the autumn of last year he went so far as to say that&#x2014;
<quote>"The essence of the duty of a Territorial Force is to protect against possible invasion, and in that way to render invasion unlikely."</quote>
My noble friend the Under-Secretary of State for War, in a speech at Warwick Castle in March of this year, went even further than that, for he is reported in <i>The Times</i> to have used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The nation had placed the grave responsibility upon the Territorial Army of undertaking, if need be, the defence of the country against a foreign invasion, even in the absence of the Regular Army upon foreign service."</quote>
Now I should like to ask my noble friend, if, as I presume to be the case, he is correctly reported, whether he was speaking for himself or for the War Office, because it does appear from these statements that the purport of the Territorial Force has assumed a much more ambitious character.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00559">The view when I was at the War Office&#x2014;a view, if I may say so, to a considerable extent inherited from the theory which was expounded by Mr. Balfour in May, 1906&#x2014;was that granted we possessed command of the sea invasion was not probable, and that what we had to protect ourselves against was not invasion, but a raid. If the view of the War Office now is that the Territorial Force is designed to resist invasion it seems to me that we have cause for very considerable anxiety, and for this reason. I think there is now very little support for the theory which Mr. Balfour expounded in 1906. I also have a shrewd suspicion&#x2014;once bitten twice shy&#x2014;that that will be the first and also the last occasion upon which the Committee of Imperial Defence will make any official statement to Parliament upon this matter. Within very recent time considerable and material facts have occurred. The debate of last November brought home to the people of this country that, as Lord Roberts said on that occasion,
<col>194</col>
a serious invasion of this country is not only possible but probable. I would remind your Lordships that that is not the opinion only of Lord Roberts, perhaps the highest authority we have at the present day, but also the opinion carefully stated by Sir John Ardagh before the Norfolk Commission. Within a very short time&#x2014;and I would observe that this is no question of party politics that we are discussing&#x2014;within a very short time the whole weight of military opinion has come round to the view that an invasion of this country is within the region of probability.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00560">But, apart from that, there are other influences and other facts which we have to bear in mind. First and foremost, it would be idle for any one to say that at the present moment the country has that confidence in the Navy which it had a few years ago. I am not referring to the <i>personnel</i>; but it is pretty clear that without Colonial assistance we cannot maintain the two-Power standard&#x2014;I care not in which particular way you choose to read the two-Power standard. But, even with Colonial assistance, we can hardly expect the Colonies, human nature being what it is, to submit to a condition of things in which they are to provide Dreadnoughts in order to police the English Channel. I feel, and I think it is the general feeling outside, that what we have to confront is an attack upon the heart and the centre of the Empire itself. And even supposing that with the assistance of the Colonies we could maintain the two-Power standard, I think it is hardly conceivable that when we were engaged in a really serious war those Colonial contributions in the way of battleships would not be required by the Colonies themselves to protect their own shores. I think, also, that when statements are made as to the extreme difficulty of landing troops it ought to be remembered that in 1854 the Allies in the Crimea, in the old days of row-boats, landed in a single day 52,000 men and eighty-three guns, 300 miles from our own base and only thirty miles from the Russian base at Sebastopol, without a single catastrophe. I think that is a solid and substantial fact which ought to be borne in mind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00561">I see that Lord Haversham has a Notice on the Paper in which he attempts to raise the question of finance. I do not think, with regard to the protection of this country from invasion, that the question of cost is of first-rate or even of second-rate importance. We must be secure against invasion at all
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0101"/>
<col>195</col>
cost. As has been pointed out before by experts in the matter, to protect this country by the Navy beyond a certain point is far more costly than by a combination of both the Army and the Navy. In dealing with naval finance you think in millions. A battle ship costs about &#x00A3;1,250,000. The whole cost of the Territorial Army at the present moment is only &#x00A3;3,500,000. It seems to me that if you could stiffen and strengthen your Territorial Force by Regulars or otherwise you would get more results for your money in that direction than by putting the whole of your eggs into the naval basket, and practically relying entirely on the Navy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00562">The question I wish specially to ask is this&#x2014;Have the Government provided for the contingency of the striking force being abroad? Have we yet had it stated by any independent military authority that in the case of a serious war&#x2014;and that is a contingency we are bound to consider and provide against&#x2014;the Territorial Force would not in those circumstances have to confront an invasion by picked Continental troops, and to confront them within a few weeks of the commencement of the war? It is admitted that the Territorial Force is not a competent force for that purpose on its peace training. That is admitted. It was not admitted as regards the Volunteers and the Yeomanry, though it might have been, but we have, as it were, a statutory and legal declaration to that effect in regard to the Territorials, because they are to receive their six months training when the national emergency arises. That being so, is it not certain that with the present feeling in the country, which would probably be intensified in the case of a great national emergency, the striking force would never be allowed to leave unless the country was satisfied that there was a sufficient force at home to afford protection against invasion? Where then is your striking force?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00563">It is, of course, impossible to provide against every conceivable contingency, for the dangers of the British Empire are of an unusual and extraordinary character. The Empire is so scattered that nobody can tell where or at what time grave difficulties may arise. Suppose the striking force for imperative reasons had to go to India. That would probably be the time when a Continental Power wishing to get something from this country would bring pressure to bear, and if we had our striking force
<col>196</col>
in India, or at the Cape, or elsewhere, I maintain that in the present uncertainty and with the great increase in ship-building going on in foreign countries which alters the balance of naval power in Europe, we should be in a difficult and critical position. I am anxious to know what is the position which the Government assumes with regard to this matter. We know that it would not be so easy to arouse enthusiasm for recruiting if the men in the Territorial Force were told that they were only to protect this country against raids or to perform garrison duties; but, whatever may be said by those in authority, I do not believe that the people of this country would ever be satisfied that the striking force should go abroad unless they felt that they had a sufficient Army at home. Therefore in order to make your striking force a real potent striking force you must create security in the mind of the British public that they have an Army at home of such a character as can meet foreign troops and meet them in the event of a naval disaster; for, as the Secretary of State has said and as all tacticians know, there always will be a great element of uncertainty and risk in naval warfare. For that reason I beg to ask my noble friend whether the Territorial Force is intended to be able to meet an invasion in the absence of the striking force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00564">As to my Motion for Papers, in the special Army Order of September 12, 1906, which allotted to the General Staff the direction of general policy in Army matters and which went into considerable detail, the function of the General Staff was described as the training and preparation of the Army for war. Surely we have now some right to ask that we should have presented to us the opinion of the General Staff. A very interesting Report has been published on the Forces of the Crown, but, like many Reports of that kind, it is more remarkable for its omissions than for its commissions. There is one thing conspicuously absent. Although it touches very gingerly on the Territorial Army, it does not state what we want to know&#x2014;namely, what are the functions of the Territorial Army, and whether that Army is efficient and fitted for the functions which it has to perform. We should like to know the opinion of the General Staff upon this matter. We should like to hear from them whether they consider that foreign troops may not confront the Territorials during the first few weeks of a war. We should like to know whether
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0102"/>
<col>197</col>
they say that the training would be adequate. Let us bear this in mind, that to protect this country against invasion it is not men but soldiers we want. You cannot have a better example of the comparative inefficiency and inutility of hastily-raised levies, inspired, it may be, by the highest patriotism, and by the greatest pluck, than what happened during the Franco-German War.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00565">I should like to ask my noble friend for certain figures, and if he cannot give them this afternoon I hope he will endeavour to do so before next Monday's debate. Can he state the number of Regulars who would be left in this country after the striking force had gone abroad? Can he give the number of Regulars who would so be left of not less than one year's service? And can he also state the number of officers on the active list who would be left in this country&#x2014;I expressly wish the noble Lord to exclude what are called the Reserve of Officers? If my noble friend cannot give me the precise figures I should be glad if he would give the practical numbers. I thank your Lordships for the attentive hearing you have given me, and I beg to put the Question and move the Motion which stand in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00566">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the Territorial Force.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Portsmouth</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00567"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend has put a number of questions which are difficult to answer because he has left out of account a thing of which we, in everything we have said or thought on the subject o f the Territorial Force, have always taken the greatest account; and that is the question of the time that must elapse before we can consider the Territorial Force capable of meeting highly-trained troops in anything like equal numbers in the field.<lb/>
My noble friend referred to what Mr. Haldane had said and to what I had said, and asked me to explain a sentence which he quoted from my speech at Warwick. I think, as far as my recollection serves me, that I qualified the statement that the Territorial Force might be called upon to meet unassisted an army of foreign invaders by the observation that that was an eventual possibility which the Territorial Force must contemplate. We have always considered
<col>198</col>
that the Force must have a longer period of embodied training than it gets under peace conditions. That is well worth taking into account, not only when considering the Territorial Force as organised at present, but also as under the different system we are going to discuss next Monday. We have always said that there must be a considerable period of embodied training before the Territorial Force is fit to take the field. It is impossible to answer the question unless that consideration is weighed. If the noble Earl asks whether the Territorial Force ever will be capable of meeting an invasion, the answer certainly would be Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00568"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I want to know now&#x2014;at the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00569"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Then my answer to that is unhesitatingly No. The Territorial Force is not at present fit to meet anything like equally the most highly-trained Continental troops. That is bound to be the case. On the other hand, when the Territorial Force has had this period of embodied training, there is no doubt that it would be as good as any other troops in the world for its purpose. I do not understand my noble friend when he says that the position is changed since he was at the War Office. We have not changed in the least in our view of what the Territorial Force is capable of. We have always taken the line that when considering the question of an invasion, the existence of the Navy and of all our military forces must be taken into account, and I do not see what useful purpose can be served by discussing the safety of this country from invasion from the point of view solely of the efficiency of the Territorial Force.<lb/>
I think, too, that it would be useless to attempt to answer my noble friend in regard to the point he raised dealing with the absence from this country of the striking force. The question of how our naval and military forces are disposed must be taken into consideration, and can be taken into consideration, only when the occasion arises&#x2014;when the war takes place. My noble friend asks for the opinion of the General Staff upon the efficiency of the Territorial Force. I do not know that the General Staff is, from its formation, necessarily the right means of expressing an opinion of this sort. My noble friend will see, on reference to the Report of the Esher Committee, with which I know he is familiar,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0103"/>
<col>199</col>
that special steps were taken for obtaining the highest possible military criticism upon the value and efficiency of our military forces. It was for that purpose that the Inspector-General was appointed; and if my noble friend wishes to have expert military opinion upon the efficiency of the Territorial Force, he cannot do better than consult the Return which has just been published, containing the report of Sir John French upon the inspections he has been making during the past few months. The other questions of my noble friend are, I think, precisely the same as those which have been asked previously, and to which I have three times replied to Lord Hardinge that I regret I am unable to give the answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00570"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am somewhat reluctant to interfere in the domestic differences between the two noble Lords opposite, but the one thing which is comparatively clear is that the Territorial Army is at present distinctly the most mysterious force that has ever existed in the history of the civilised world. A large portion of last session, and, if I am not mistaken, a considerable portion of the previous one, was taken up by lengthy inquiries, directed principally from this side of the House, as to the objects and functions of the Territorial Force. To whom were those inquiries addressed? Why, to the noble Earl who has brought forward this Motion to-day. It was the noble Earl's duty to reply to those inquiries, and yet he calmly tells us now that he has not the least idea for what purpose the Territorial Force exists.<lb/>
The speech of the noble Earl is, in my opinion, a great advance upon his previous performances, and if I had made it myself I do not know that I could have uttered sounder sentiments. In fact, were I of a conceited disposition I should almost be inclined to infer that the noble Earl had been studying some of the numerous speeches I myself have made on this particular subject. I think his speech may fairly be said completely to justify the opinion which I expressed regarding him last year&#x2014;namely, that he was a person in whom much greater confidence could be placed than could be placed in his former chief the present Secretary of State for War. The noble Earl, at any rate, has seen the error of his ways and has been converted.<lb/>
<col>200</col>
With regard to the inquiries he has made of the noble Lord who represents the War Office, I am afraid that my noble friend cannot have been following our proceedings with the attention he usually bestows upon them, or he would have realised that there was no possibility of extracting an answer from the Government on this point. These questions are in the category of inconvenient questions. If you answer them you have to disclose very unpleasant and perturbing facts, and in such a case the invariable formula is that it is contrary to the public interest to give the information required.<lb/>
But, however that may be and whatever may be the merits of the noble Earl's speech, it is hardly appropriate at this time to anticipate the important discussion which is to take place next Monday and Tuesday. If the noble Earl, however, desires to see the Territorial Force made really serviceable he is bound to support the Bill of the noble and gallant Earl, Lord Roberts. And if his intervention in debate has served no more useful purpose than that, I conceive it a distinct gain that the noble Earl, who only recently was one of the trusted officials of the War Office, has been converted to the justness and fairness of the views which I, in common with many noble Lords, have expressed during the past two or three years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00571"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only want to ask a question of the noble Lord who represents the War Office. I understood him, in the course of his remarks, to refer the House to the recently issued report of the Inspector-General in regard to the present condition of the Territorial Force. I, like most of your Lordships, have read that Paper, but I did not succeed in finding any very complete account of the condition of the Territorial Force. Reference is made to a memorandum on the inspections of the Force carried out during the spring of the year, but when you come to details it appears that the Inspector-General was able to visit only the West Riding Territorial Division, upon which he comments in very favourable terms. That inspection was in the highest degree satisfactory and encouraging, but I do not gather that any other divisions of the Territorial Army have been inspected. Perhaps the noble Lord will set me right if I am wrong.</membercontribution></p>

I forget the exact number which he had actually inspected at the time he wrote this memorandum, but they amounted to a considerable portion of the Territorial Force. He has been very hard at work most of the winter, and his memorandum is based on what he has seen of approximately one-half of the Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00573"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was rather glad that the noble Marquess opposite, who had also read the report of the Inspector-General, had come to the conclusion, which I stated in my speech, that it is exceedingly niggardly in giving information as to the efficiency of the Territorial Force. My desire was &#x2014;I am afraid I have not been able to elicit much from my noble friend on the point&#x2014; to ascertain what is the purpose of the Territorial Force. My noble friend has told your Lordships that at present the Force is inefficient, but that it may be efficient after embodiment for six months. Whether the Force will have an opportunity to attain efficiency depends, therefore, upon the consideration and politeness of our opponents. I am sorry that the noble Lord cannot give any information as to the number of Regulars and the number of officers. I regret it for this reason, that when information of that kind is withheld the public inevitably draws the conclusion that the state of affairs is not satisfactory, and that produces a far greater feeling of distrust than if some approximate numbers were given which would have a very reassuring effect upon public opinion.

<title>TRAWLING IN PROHIBITED AREAS (PREVENTION) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00600" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00601">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00602"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will remember a discussion on this subject which took place at no more distant date than last November. At that time this Bill had been introduced in another place, but no progress was made with it last year. It was re-introduced at the beginning of this session and now comes before this House in a slightly altered form, but it comes here, so far as I am aware, and certainly according to what occurred in another place, as an agreed Bill. Both sections of opinion interested in this measure, the last stage in a somewhat long controversy, are agreed that the Bill represents a desirable and even a necessary step in the matter.<lb/>
Your Lordships are aware that by an Act of some twenty years ago the Fishery Board for Scotland acquired powers to prohibit by by-law the method of fishing called trawling in certain areas of the sea off the coast of Scotland. These areas were closed by by-law after the passing of that Act, and while for several years that closure was effective, about five years after the by-law was first enacted a foreign trawler appeared in the Moray Firth. There have always been accidental and occasional foreign trawlers fishing in the Firth. About the years 1897 and 1898 and onwards to 1900 a practice sprung up of fishing in the Moray Firth by British subjects, who, in order to effect this purpose, registered their trawlers under a foreign flag. This difficulty increased as
<col>208</col>
years went on, and after every effort had been employed by administrative means and by carrying out the statutory powers then in force to check the evil, the matter was carried to the High Court in 1906, and the High Court declared the law to be that it was illegal for foreigners to fish in these prohibited areas. That was declared to be the law, but, as your Lordships are well aware, it was not possible to enforce that law as against the subjects of other nations.<lb/>
This is a Bill to effectively close these waters. They are closed, let me say parenthetically, in the general interest&#x2014;in the interest of the protection of the supply of fish in the North Sea; and this closure has, as a subsidiary result, the effect of giving some protection to the line fishermen who dwell on the shores of these waters. This closure is infringed, in the first place, by occasional genuine foreign trawlers, and, in the second place, to a very much larger extent&#x2014;to an extent so large as to constitute practically almost the whole of the evil&#x2014;by those <i>pseudo</i> foreign trawlers which are financed and in many cases owned entirely by British subjects or British companies fishing under a foreign flag. There is another feature of the position which must be noticed and it is this, that practically the whole of the fish caught by these <i>pseudo</i> foreign trawlers is landed at English ports. It is not landed at Scottish ports for the reason that the Act of 1889&#x2014;the original foundation of this closure&#x2014;prohibited the landing in Scottish ports of fish caught in these prohibited areas. The prohibition has been enforced, and no such fish is now landed at Scottish ports. But these trawlers are able to evade the law by being still permitted to land their fish at English ports.<lb/>
The method of this Bill is to extend to English ports the prohibition of landing such fish which is now operative in Scotland. In the opinion of those concerned&#x2014;and I have already mentioned that both sections of opinion unite in supporting this Bill, the details of which they have worked out&#x2014;this will be an effectual step, and will succeed in preventing the illegal fishing which now goes on in the Moray Firth. A doubt has been expressed that the purpose of this Bill may be defeated by the development of what now goes on in a very small degree&#x2014;namely, the catching of fish in
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0108"/>
<col>209</col>
the Moray Firth and shipping them to foreign ports. Such fishing as goes on under those conditions&#x2014;that is to say, of landing at foreign ports&#x2014;is occasional, is seasonal, and is confined to certain classes of fish not, properly speaking, the subject of trawling. The main object of these steam trawlers is to catch flat fish, soles, plaice, and other fish of that character which are valuable in the markets. But there is a second reason which is held by those having great experience and authority in this matter to be, if not conclusive, almost conclusive, against the probability of the establishment of any such industry as a regular fishing in the Moray Firth. It is known as a fact by those who hold this opinion that the Moray Firth is not prolific or extensive enough to afford the basis of the establishment of an industry simply to fish the Moray Firth. To come across from ports on the other side of the North Sea, or even to come from Grimsby, and to carry the fish, not to English markets, but across the North Sea involves not only time but extra expense, and to support such extra charges the fishing in the Moray Firth would have to be far more regular and far more productive than it has hitherto proved to be. Though it is, of course, not possible to exclude altogether a doubt on this point, all the probabilities indicate that the proceeding proposed under this Bill will be effectual for the purpose in view.<lb/>
The controversy has been a long one, and it is a satisfaction to His Majesty's Government to find that the two parties to the controversy are agreed that this Bill deserves consideration and should pass into law, as being, if not the final stage in this controversy, at any rate an obvious and necessary next step to be taken. I understand that there is no general desire that the discussion of this Bill should be prolonged at this stage, and therefore I have ventured to confine myself to outlining the situation. If the information which I have given is too scanty, I shall be glad to supplement it, but I understand that there may be Amendments proposed in Committee, and possibly that may afford a more convenient opportunity for going into any of the details which, in your Lordships' opinion, still require consideration. I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00604"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of placing any obstruction in the way of the progress of this Bill. At the same time I cannot help thinking that indirectly there is a very serious matter involved in the Bill which requires consideration. I think it becomes very important in these days to see what are the principles upon which it is supposed that foreign vessels can come into the Moray Firth and fish. The purpose of this Bill, I think, is one to which all would agree, and, as I have said, I do not speak for the purpose of obstruction in any way; but it has to be remembered that the whole principle upon which the idea of the three-mile limit was based was the right that every nation possessed to protect its own shores. The area over which that right of protection existed was limited to the <i>ultima vis armorum</i>, and it would be absurd to say that the <i>ultima vis armorum</i> was now limited to three miles. There is no apparent admission by this country of the limitation of the area within which we can actually prohibit; but it may be hereafter used as an argument that we were so well aware of the limit that international law would place upon the right of prohibition that this indirect means of preventing it had been resorted to. I only wish to say that, so far as I am concerned, I have never myself, as a Judge, admitted that the three-mile limit is one that international law recognises. It is not the limit which some other countries themselves adopt and insist upon. But, be that as it may, as long as the principle upon which the right of protection to our shores exists is limited to the <i>ultima vis armorum</i> it is necessary to make a protest, in passing such legislation as this, against its being taken as an admission that we do acquiesce in that limitation, if it is not a subject of agreement, as it is in some cases between two other countries. There is no international law which would prevent a much larger limit being taken if the public interest required it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00605"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall forbear from saying anything at all about the three-mile limit, for the reason that I think we should walk very warily in this matter. Many of our best fishing districts are within ten miles of the coast of our neighbours. The question is not merely one of what is to happen to our fisheries within ten miles of our coast, but of how many of our own
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0109"/>
<col>211</col>
fishermen may be prevented from going to their present fishing grounds within ten miles of a foreign coast if we seek to extend our jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit. It is a very serious matter, and we ought not lightly to pass from any convention or any fishing custom that has been hitherto observed. It is delicate ground and I do not wish to commit myself regarding it, but merely to safeguard the House from expressing any opinion in favour of extending the three-mile limit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00606"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the very few words which I wish to address to the House I shall not touch upon the immensely important question of international law raised by my noble and learned friend beside me and discussed by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. I venture to think that the general feeling of the House will be that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack gave us good advice when he suggested that we should walk warily in dealing with that matter. I shall endeavour to walk warily by altogether avoiding the dangerous ground. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack a few days ago rather complained of our pedantry on this side of the House for desiring to extend to Scotland legislation which we regard as suitable to England, but which, in his view, was not equally applicable across the border. Here is a case in which Scottish legislation is being applied to the whole of the United Kingdom. I congratulate the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, because this really is a triumph of the policy of the Scottish Office over other competing policies which have found favour at different times. I agree in thinking that your Lordships would do well to offer no obstacle to the passing of this Bill. It is, at any rate, an attempt to extricate us from a most difficult and embarrassing position.<lb/>
The position, roughly speaking, is this. Under our municipal law we are unable to prevent foreign trawlers from frequenting the waters of the Moray Firth, although that municipal law renders liable to very severe pains and penalties British trawlers found fishing in these waters. That is naturally regarded, particularly by our own fishermen, as an intolerable situation, and the time certainly has come for endeavouring to find some means of escape
<col>212</col>
from it. The impatience with which the present state of things is regarded is no doubt increased by the fact that, as the noble Lord observed, a good many of these so-called foreign trawlers are not really foreign trawlers at all, but British vessels masquerading for improper purposes as foreign fishing boats. I suppose that at first sight we should all of us be inclined to say that the best mode of escaping from these difficulties would be that some international agreement might be come to as to the conditions under which fishermen of all kinds might resort to the waters of the Moray Firth. But, of course, we all know that, while it is a very simple matter to talk about international arrangements for such a purpose, an international arrangement which we should be in a position to accept would be by no means a simple thing to obtain. As was said by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, our fishermen frequent waters in other parts of the world with regard to which the adjoining territorial Powers hold no doubt very much the same kind of views as those which we hold with regard to the Moray Firth, and there can be no doubt that if we were to endeavour to bring about a transaction with the foreign countries concerned we should have to meet counterclaims on behalf of their fishermen which would be of a very inconvenient nature and which might result in a bargain by no means favourable to our own fishing industry.<lb/>
This Bill proposes to put a stop to fishing by foreigners in the Moray Firth by means of arrangements for excluding any fish which they may catch in those waters from admission to British ports. Such fish is already excluded from Scottish ports; the exclusion is to be extended to British ports. I am bound to say that while I am in favour of making this attempt, I do not feel very sanguine as to the amount of success which is likely to attend it. The remedy seems to me rather a clumsy remedy, and I am afraid it may prove to be an ineffectual remedy. I should be inclined to say that perhaps the strongest argument in favour of the Government's proposal is that by making it we shall, to a certain extent, strengthen our own hands if we should hereafter have to approach foreign countries in order to come to some arrangement with them. This Bill is, at any rate, an earnest that we ourselves are doing all we can to put an end to what we regard as an undoubted abuse.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0110"/>
<col>213</col>
But, my Lords, when we come to the machinery set up in the Bill it does seem to me that there may be very considerable difficulties in applying it successfully. In the first place, there is the possibility&#x2014;and I am afraid we must regard it as a possibility&#x2014;that fish taken by these illegal trawlers may be marketed in foreign ports. The noble Lord&#x2014;I was glad to hear him say so&#x2014;has apparently satisfied himself that the danger of this kind of evasion is not such a real danger as many people suppose; but in these days when fish is carried from place to place in very fast steamers, and when, as we know, ice is used for the purpose of packing fish, it does seem highly probable that fish which is excluded from a British port will be taken to the nearest foreign port, and there are ports available for that purpose.<lb/>
There is also the difficulty, which seems to me to be a real one, of identifying these poaching vessels. The whole machinery for their identification rests with the Fishery Board for Scotland. I presume the Fishery Board will keep a cruiser or a gunboat of some kind in the waters of the Moray Firth. That gunboat will have to endeavour to watch the whole of the waters&#x2014;something like 2,000 square miles&#x2014;in the Moray Firth; and it will have to satisfy itself&#x2014;those are the words of the clause&#x2014;that these boats are really engaged in illegal practices. That seems to me to be no easy task. The boat once identified is to be reported to the Customs authorities, and the Customs authorities will then destroy or confiscate the fish when it is landed at a British port. That part is simple enough, but where I foresee considerable difficulty is in the process of identification by the agents of the Fishery Board. These seem to me to be real difficulties. I shall be glad if, in Committee, or at some other time, the noble Lord is able to show us that they do not exist. I certainly do not desire to offer any objection to the passing of the Bill. It is an attempt to make the best of a very difficult situation, and I sincerely hope that the attempt may be more successful than some of us are inclined to believe it will be.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOPS (No. 2) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00608" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00609">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00610"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill which I have the honour to ask your Lordships to read a second time to-day is a small agricultural Bill, but at the same time it has a certain amount of local importance. It is a Bill that has been very much asked for, and I trust that your Lordships will give it your favourable consideration. It will be within the recollection of the House that last year the subject of the hop industry was brought before your Lordships' notice, and a very strong Committee was appointed to inquire into the question. I need not go into that. The Report has been before your Lordships' House on several occasions. The chairman of the Committee was Sir William Collins, and the members represented the various interests concerned.<lb/>
The Committee came to the conclusion that there were two legitimate grievances in this branch of the agricultural industry. First, the Committee thought that hop-growers had a grievance owing to the use of what are called "hop substitutes," and, secondly, they considered, and I think justly, that there was a grievance owing to the importation of foreign hops in unmarked bags or pockets as they are called. On December 8 last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer brought in a Bill to try and remedy in some way these grievances, but on December 17 it was withdrawn as there was no hope of passing it owing to its being opposed from both sides of the House, chiefly, I think, because the Bill itself was not properly understood. But in February of this year I happened to receive an invitation to address a large meeting at Canterbury, and there I was empowered by the Government to announce that we were prepared to reintroduce the Bill, and, if possible, to bring it into line with the general opinion on the subject and with what would be acceptable to both parties.<lb/>
The chief provisions of this Bill&#x2014;it is a very short one&#x2014;are contained in two clauses. Clause 1 contains a prohibition of the use of hop substitutes in brewing, and Clause 2 contains a prohibition of the importation of hops except in bags properly
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0111"/>
<col>215</col>
marked. Clause 1 is intended to deal with the prohibition of hop substitutes at any stage of the brewing or preparation or preservation of beer. I have been told that that is not sufficiently clear in the wording of the Bill. If that is so, I shall be quite prepared to submit an Amendment or Amendments to effect the purpose. I have had several informal discussions on the subject, and some people interested in this trade are anxious to prohibit the use of preservatives altogether. They make no secret of it. They wish to prohibit the use of preservatives altogether; but, of course, I need hardly say that to that the Government cannot agree. Our intention is to prohibit the use of preservatives when the necessary preservation can be obtained by the use of hops. That is the intention of the Bill.<lb/>
I need hardly say that I hold no brief for the brewers, but I am informed that doing away with preservatives altogether would really mean the destruction of a great trade in certain classes of beer intended for export to hot countries, owing to the fact that hops alone cannot be used in these cases for preservative purposes. I think I ought here to remind the House that the Bill I have the honour to submit is one to prohibit the use of hop substitutes and in no way a Pure Beer Bill. If preservatives prejudicial to health are used, that naturally is very objectionable and very dangerous; but, as regards that, I would remind the House that the provisions of the Public Health Act already apply to protect the public in this way, and, therefore, no amendment of the law in that direction is necessary. With regard to the provision in Clause 2 prohibiting the importation of hops except in bags properly marked, the intention of the Government&#x2014;I think it is a perfectly legitimate intention&#x2014;is to place foreign and home hop-growers on an equal footing, and not to give any preference or advantage to either side. Therefore, the marking clauses in my Bill have been drawn as far as possible on the same lines as the Hops Act of 1866.<lb/>
In Clause 2, subsection (1), paragraph (<i>a</i>), we say that the name of the owner, planter, or brewer who packs the hops into the bag or pocket should be placed in legible letters on the bag or pocket. This follows precisely the English Act. Secondly, we say that the name of the country and district in which the hops were grown should be marked. In the English Act the parish and county are required to be stated, but as we do not know
<col>216</col>
whether there are parishes in the foreign countries where hops are grown we use the words "country and district." Further, we insist on the year in which the hops were grown being placed on the pocket. That exactly follows the English Act. We also require the net weight of the hops in the bag or pocket to be stated. In the English Act the gross weight is placed on the bag, but it is supposed to be more convenient, and the Customs authorities have no objection, that the net weight should be placed on the bag in this case. I have to express my obligation to my noble friend below me (Lord Eversley) for bringing in the first definition, and I gladly adopt it. I think I can safely say that this puts the foreign hop-grower in practically the same position as the English hop-grower. I think that is fair and right, and I hope there will be no objection at any rate to that part of the Bill. I do not think I need detain the House further. I shall be perfectly ready, if your Lordships give the Bill a Second Reading, to answer any questions concerning its provisions when we go into Committee. I may say, in conclusion, that in my opinion this Bill is an honest attempt to assist an honourable, resolute, hardworking class of men and a body of farmers who have for some time been passing through a very critical period.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00611">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Carrington</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00612"><member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to enter briefly my objection, as I did when a similar Bill was last before the House, to proposals which I can only describe as simply protectionist. When the other Bill was before us the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, while giving general approval to the Bill, expressed a doubt as to the inclusion of preservatives. In spite of the explanation which has just been given of the Bill, nobody can read subsection (3) of Clause 1 without seeing that the operation of this provision is simply protectionist. The object of this clause is to compel the brewer to use hops instead of something else which he might use equally well. The noble Earl who brought in this Bill drew a sort of distinction. He suggested that the Bill was not as bad as it might seem because he prohibited using hop substitutes as substitutes for hops. He seemed to suggest that there might be beer brewed for consumption in hot climates
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0112"/>
<col>217</col>
in which a preservative other than hops would not be a substitute but an independent preservative. But I do not see that we have anything to do with that. I can well imagine that, if five shillings worth of hops are used, as good a preservative may be got as if half-a-crown's worth of something else were used. This Bill will compel the brewer to spend twice as much as he otherwise would. It is not said that the substitutes now used are in any way injurious to health. Indeed, if they were the noble Earl has explained that the offence could be dealt with under an existing Act of Parliament. Therefore we must take it that the other preservatives are used by the brewer as a matter of economy in his trade. The object of this Bill is to do a good turn to an industry which the noble Earl described pathetically as a suffering industry. I think it is a very dangerous thing that a Government which calls itself a Free Trade Government and is fighting resolutely to maintain the advantage of the consumer against the advantage of the producer, should bring in a Bill of which every line is based upon protectionist principles. Therefore if any noble Lord will join with me I shall certainly divide against the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00613"><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the first place may I be permitted to congratulate the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture on having at last, though somewhat tardily, introduced the Government's Hops Bill. My only regret is that, in the interests of agriculture, he did not do so months ago. In saying this, however, I trust that I am right in assuming that His Majesty's Government now fully recognise the extreme and sad plight of this great industry, which, as your Lordships are aware, is allied to many hundreds of other trades throughout the country, and that it is the noble Earl's firm intention to do all he possibly can to resuscitate it and thereby check the widespread ruin which is now devastating and fast depopulating the hop-growing districts in six counties in England.<lb/>
In thus congratulating the noble Earl I do so upon what I hope is the object of his Bill. I am basing my belief on the good intentions that have been so often expressed, not only by the noble Earl as Minister for Agriculture, but by other members of His Majesty's Government rather than upon the actual wording of the
<col>218</col>
Bill. Personally I welcome the Bill, and I do not wish to cavil or to quarrel with the noble Earl as to whom belongs the credit for having introduced a Hops Bill, for I can assure him that I am fully prepared, as also are many noble Lords on both sides of the House, to do all that is possible to assist in passing this Bill rapidly into law, provided that certain Amendments are agreed to in Committee in order to make the provisions of the Bill clearer than they are at the present time, and to check abuses which have been so frequently demonstrated and which His Majesty's Government have so continually proclaimed that it is their wish to remove.<lb/>
In the course of the debate on the Hops Bill I had the honour of introducing in your Lordships' House a short time ago I was accused&#x2014;I think somewhat unfairly&#x2014;of having arrayed myself in the feathers of His Majesty's Government, and at the same time of having stolen the clothes of the noble Earl while he was bathing. My Lords, I plead not guilty to both charges. The feathers of His Majesty's Government and the clothes of the noble Earl have now been produced to your Lordships, and although they are very much alike in appearance to those which I have been accused of having purloined, I venture to think that when your Lordships scrutinise them in Committee you will discover that there is a great deal of difference between the clothes which the noble Earl now claims as his own and those which I am supposed to have stolen from him. In appearance, I admit, they are very ranch alike; but on closer inspection your Lordships will, I think, consider that mine are the better fit. In fact, I think you will have very little difficulty in discovering that my Bill is my own and a good fit, whilst the Bill of the noble Earl now before the House is not quite the same thing, and is, if I may say so, somewhat of a misfit.<lb/>
I believe I am right in asserting that the primary purpose for which both of these Bills were designed was to prohibit the use of hop substitutes in the brewing and preservation of beer, and, at the same time, to secure that all foreign hops marketed in the United Kingdom should be liable to the same restrictions, no more or no less, as English hops are rightly subjected to according to the laws of this country. Such being the case, I am bold enough to think that my Bill, which has already
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0113"/>
<col>219</col>
passed through the Committee stage in your Lordships' House, would carry out that purpose in both instances, and, with due respect to the Minister for Agriculture, I do not think his Bill is quite so clear. I do not, however, wish at this stage to take up the time of your Lordships by entering into any minute criticism with regard to the details of this Bill.<lb/>
But I would like to point out that Clause 1, which deals with hop substitutes, appears to me to be somewhat vague. I submit that, with the present wording, the Bill would undoubtedly effectively prohibit the use of hop substitutes, whether preservative or flavouring, in the brewing of beer, but it would leave the brewer or the publican a free hand to use either of these substitutes subsequently in beer. If such is the case, the Bill would be absolutely useless to the farmer or hop-grower for whose benefit it has been professedly designed. I trust, therefore, that the noble Earl will allow us to so amend the Bill when we go into Committee as to insure that all hop substitutes, whether chemical, preservative, or flavouring, are as effectually prohibited in beer as in brewing.<lb/>
I would also like to point out one other weakness in this clause as regards the term "hop substitute." In my opinion the expression "hop substitute" should be clearly defined as "any bitter article or substitute or preservative other than hops capable of being used in the brewing or preservation of beer." In the Government Bill the term "hop substitute" means "any article capable of being used in the brewing of beer as a substitute for hops either for flavouring or for preservative purposes." Only last month I read an article in a brewers' trade journal which showed the weakness of this phrase, and which pointed out that if this section were passed without any alteration those who used these preservative substitutes might still be able to do so by claiming that the preservatives were not substitutes for hops. I suggest this alteration in the Bill, for I feel sure that the noble Earl is desirous of preventing misapprehension and expensive litigation in the future.<lb/>
I submit that Clause 2, which deals with the marking of bags or pockets of hops, also requires alteration so that all foreign hops dealt with in England shall be subject
<col>220</col>
to the same restrictions as English hops. Under the present wording, the Bill would undoubtedly favour the foreigner by allowing the substitution of the name of the "owner" on the packets of hops for the name of the actual "grower." This, in my opinion, would be a gross and unfair preference to the foreign dealer who competes with the English grower. Although these alterations are small ones, they are, in my opinion, vital, and absolutely necessary in the interests of the English hop industry and in fulfilment of the promise given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade to the hop deputation which waited upon them in July last. With these reservations as regards future action in Committee, I shall support the Second Reading of the Bill; and I wish to assure the noble Earl that I will give him all the assistance I can to make this Bill, what I believe he desires it to be, an act of justice to a long-suffering and down-trodden English industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00614"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to speak against this Bill. It was most interesting to notice the Free Trade shot which was fired just now from the Back-benches opposite at the noble Earl who proposed the Second Reading of this Bill. Clause 1, subsection (2), provides that if any brewer for sale uses any hop substitute in the brewing of beer, or receives or has in his custody or possession any article in contravention of the section, he shall incur an Excise penalty. The clause then goes on to define the expression "hop substitute" as meaning any article capable of being used in the brewing of beer as a substitute for hops either for flavouring or for preservative purposes. Now, I daresay the noble Earl in charge of the Bill has received a copy of the paper which I hold in my hand from the Brewers' Society, containing reasons against those particular words in the section. It seems to me that there is a great deal of common-sense in the statements contained in this paper. If the definition in the Bill of a "hop substitute" is allowed to include a substitute used for preservative purposes, the brewers in this county will have to change their method of brewing.<lb/>
I have read the debates which took place earlier in the session upon Lord Hardinge's Bill, and I find that Lord Hardinge stated that German brewers used no preservatives whatever. The truth is that German
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0114"/>
<col>221</col>
brewers preserve their beer for home consumption by fermenting it at a very low temperature; but when the beer is exported certain preservatives have to be added, and the preservatives used are more deleterious than those employed by brewers in this country. As the noble Earl has invited us to bring forward Amendments in Committee, I hope he will consider this question when it is raised. Brewers would much rather have a schedule of things which could or could not be used. If the particular words now in the Bill remain they will have the effect of compelling brewers to alter the whole system of brewing as now carried on in this country. If the preservative substances are harmful, the Excise authorities have power to deal with the matter most efficiently. Then the noble Earl mentioned that the necessary preservative could be obtained by hops and hops alone, but he went on to say that doing away with preservatives altogether would ruin the foreign trade. Then the foreigners are to have English beer with preservatives in it but English brewers are to alter their system of brewing altogether and only to use hops. That is hardly a consistent statement. I say that with all respect to the noble Earl, and I hope that when the Bill goes into Committee he will either define it more clearly himself or give those interested a chance of moving Amendments for that purpose. The beer leaves the brewer in a fit state to be consumed, but when it gets to the public-house the publican can put what he likes in it, and nothing will prevent him from putting in all sorts of substances which are harmful to the human system. I think the Bill a most excellent one, and I must congratulate the noble Earl upon bringing in a measure which is decidedly for the protection of a very important industry in this country&#x2014;I say an important industry because I have always read that Englishmen fought and conquered on beef and beer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00615"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am unwilling that the debate should close without another protest being entered from this side against the entire conception of this Bill. The two noble Lords on the other side of the House who have spoken have referred to it as a Bill to protect the farmer and the hop-grower, and the noble Earl who has just sat down emphatically spoke of it as a Bill entirely designed for the protection of the farmer.
<col>222</col>
That is the character of this measure. I do not think my noble friend will receive any congratulation upon this Bill from anyone who has at heart or understands the principles of Free Trade.<lb/>
What is the scope of this Bill? It is a Bill to prevent a manufacturer of beer using one article instead of another in the process of its manufacture, no suggestion being made that the substitution is in any way injurious to the health of the consumer. It is, therefore, a direct infraction of the liberty of production on the one side and the liberty of consumption on the other. Every step in the industrial development of mankind is a step associated with some change which throws hardship on particular persons who up to the introduction of that step had been engaged in some particular method of satisfying the process which is then simplified or improved. No step is made without somebody suffering, and one sympathises with those who have to undergo suffering as the result of change. Is there any suggestion that the measure now before your Lordships' House differs in principle from any measure to prohibit the introduction of foreign wheat, or foreign barley, or foreign oats, or foreign vegetables, or foreign butter? There used to be an advertisement years ago of orange marmalade as a substitute for butter. You might as well introduce a Bill to prevent the use of orange marmalade, inasmuch as its use as a substitute for butter injures the dairy farmer.<lb/>
Every step, as I have said, has involved some hardship, some penalty, some painful experience on particular classes of producers who up to that time had been engaged in satisfying the wants of the community in that respect; but the community has benefited by the simpler and easier method of satisfying its wants. Now we are deliberately asked by the Government to support a Bill the principle of which is entirely opposed to the principle on which the Government was founded. If there was one thing more than another on which the last General Election was taken, it was on the issue of Free Trade, and it is upon the maintenance of that issue that the continuance of the Government in power depends. In those circumstances, the Government are absolutely violating all the conditions under which they came into office in proposing a Bill of simple, un-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0115"/>
<col>223</col>
adulterated, naked Protection. I cannot, permit the Bill to pass without a protest, and I join with my noble friend in opposing the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00616"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has introduced this Bill must, no doubt, have expected to be good-humouredly rallied by my noble friend behind me on the facility with which he has assimilated principles commonly accepted on these Benches but not so popular on the Benches opposite. It is really an interesting illustration of the manner in which public opinion is moving to find the noble Earl opposite recommending a Bill to the House on the ground that it is intended to place foreign and home hop-growers on an equal footing. That is a sentiment which within our recollection would have been regarded as a most heretical sentiment by members of the Party opposite, but we now find that it is a sentiment entirely acceptable to His Majesty's Government. It was really touching to see the two noble Lords on the Back Bench opposite&#x2014;my noble friends Lord Stanley of Alderley and Lord Courtney&#x2014;lonely and pathetic figures, alone protesting against this labefaction of principle on the part of their friends.<lb/>
I agree that this Bill should be read a second time, and it seems to me that the points which have been raised, very interesting and important points, are points probably better suited for discussion in Committee than in a Second Reading debate. But they are points of considerable moment. I notice two in particular. There is the question of the conditions under which preservatives are to be used. Lord Stanley of Alderley was quite correct in saying that upon a former occasion I raised a note of warning as to the kind of provisions that might be inserted in this Bill with regard to the use of preservatives, because it does seem to me conceivable that there may be perfectly innocent and indispensable preservatives without which certain classes of beer cannot be properly brewed. That is, however, a point which we may well discuss on a subsequent occasion.<lb/>
The other point raised by Lord Hardinge seems to me more important still. Lord Hardinge took exception to the wording of the clause with regard to the marking of packages containing hops. Lord
<col>224</col>
Carrington said that the packages were to be properly marked. That was his expression. Now, what do we mean when we talk of a package of hops being properly marked? I take it that the object is that the mark should be of a kind to afford evidence as to the origin of the particular parcel of hops, and, therefore, my noble friend Lord Hardinge in his Bill desired that the package should be marked in such a way as to show who had grown the hops. That is a very substantial point, and it is an entirely different thing to say that the mark shall reveal, not who grew the hops, but the owner of the hops, because it is quite clear that a dealer may become possessed of hops of all kinds of qualities and different origins, mix them together, and put them into one package so that the public may be misled. The point has been raised before, and we were certainly under the impression that His Majesty's Ministers agreed with my noble friend Lord Hardinge. I find, in the report of the proceedings when the hop deputation waited upon Mr. Lloyd George, that in addressing the deputation Mr. Lloyd-George said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have no fear of the principle which has been impressed upon me by Mr. Bannister&#x2014;that you should compel these gentlemen to mark their hops with the country of origin and the date of origin. There is nothing unfair in that."</quote>
Then he was interrupted by a member of the deputation. The report proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. BANNISTER (emphatically): 'And the name of the grower, sir; exactly the same as we have to do in all particulars.'</quote>
<quote>"Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE: 'Quite right. Whatever conditions you impose on the British grower should be imposed on the foreigner. That is not a departure from Free Trade.'"</quote>
A very welcome admission. I mention that because I have no doubt that the noble Earl will be prepared to deal with it when we come to Committee. Meanwhile I can only congratulate my noble friend Lord Hardinge that his Bill, with these few alterations, has been appropriated by His Majesty's Government and has apparently a very good prospect of becoming law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00617"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture adopted the recommendation of the noble Viscount opposite and excluded the word "owner" he would make a distinction between the law now prevailing in England as regards the

<col>225</col>
marking of hops and the law under this Bill for foreign hops. The noble Earl has followed the wording of the Hop Marking Act of 1866. Under that Act the name of the owner in substitution for that of the grower may be marked on the bag. Of course, as a general rule the name of the grower only is marked on the bag, but in the rare cases where the grower sells to any person who dries the hops in his own kiln then the name of the person to whom the hops are sold&#x2014;namely, the owner&#x2014;can be marked on the bag instead of that of the grower. If my noble friend representing the Government were to adopt the recommendation of the noble Viscount and exclude the word "owner," insisting that in every case the name of the grower should be on the bags, the effect would be to exclude a very large quantity of hops from the Continent. Hop-growing on the Continent is a very different industry from what it is in England, because Continental hops are grown by small cultivators who cannot possibly have their own kilns. As a rule, they dry the hops partially on hurdles, and they are sold in that state to brewers for immediate use. But when the hops are sold for the purpose of export to England they are purchased &#x0129;n small quantities by merchants, who sort and send them to central establishments where they are kiln-dried and exported to this country. Therefore if the noble Viscount's suggestion were adopted the result would be to exclude hops from a very large part of the Continent, and that, in effect, would be a prohibition in the nature of Protection, and it would be far more serious, in my opinion, than even a duty on hops. I think, therefore, that the noble Earl behind me has done wisely in inserting the word "owner" as well as the word "grower." I believe that if the clause in the noble Earl's Bill were assimilated to that in the measure of the noble Viscount the Bill would not have the remotest</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00619"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no reason to complain of the reception that my Bill has received, nor of the very good-natured banter in which the noble Lords opposite have indulged. I deny the statement made by my two noble friends behind me that this is a protectionist measure. It is a matter of opinion. If I had thought it a protectionist measure, or that it constituted any serious interference with the doctrines of Free Trade, I would never have taken the liberty of introducing it in your Lordships' House. The object of noble Lords in insisting upon the word "grower" is to do all they can to hamper the introduction of foreign hops likely in any way to affect the hop industry. I do not quarrel with them on that account, because they are open Protectionists, but the effect of putting the word "grower" on the pockets would be to keep out all German hops. These hops are grown on very small plots of land, and it is really impossible to put all the names of the growers on the pockets. Not only would such a provision hinder the possibility of German and Bavarian hops being brought here, but it would prevent a great firm like Bass and Co. from pursuing their somewhat unpatriotic course of using fifty per cent. of Bavarian hops instead of English hops in the production of their beer, after having educated John Bull's palate to the use of Bavarian hops. That is all I have to say in reply, and I trust that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PUBLIC-HOUSES IMPROVEMENT BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00624" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00625">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00626"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is only about half a year ago that I had the honour of presenting to your Lordships a Bill almost in similar form to that which I present to-day. Therefore it is not necessary for me to go at length into the reasons for reintroducing the Bill, or to explain why in my opinion there is necessity for it. Moreover, in the course of the last debate your Lordships were for the most part in agreement with the objects of the Bill, though disapproval was expressed in some quarters of the machinery in the Bill. In the country generally there is, as far as I can gather, a desire for legislation on these lines, and the only opponents are the extreme teetotal people and those whose minds are so imbued with the idea that a public-house can only be a gin palace or drinking shop that they cannot conceive of a public-house run on modern lines.<lb/>
There is one difference in the Bill as now presented, and it has been made to meet the criticism that if you remove the discretion of the magistrates in regard to alterations and improvements in the structure and general conditions of public-houses, these alterations might take the form of facilitating an increase in the sale of intoxicants. Certainly that was not
<col>228</col>
my object in introducing the Bill, and therefore I have tried to meet this criticism by putting in the proviso which appears at the-end of Clause 1&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided always that no alteration in the premises or fittings, the chief effect of which would be, in the opinion of the licensing justices, to increase the consumption of intoxicating liquors only, shall be deemed to come within the provisions of this section: Provided also that in case of refusal to sanction alterations on the last-named ground an appeal shall lie to quarter sessions."</quote>
I hope that will satisfy those who were critics of the Bill as it originally stood.<lb/>
There was another objection raised last year. The Lord Chancellor objected very strongly to games and music being allowed, stating that that would practically amount to setting up a music-hall in connection with every public-house. I had no desire to see that. What I meant was automatic music. The same with games. I would only allow games in which the customers of the public-house would be the absolute participants. I have no desire to see a music-hall as an ordinary accompaniment of a public-house, and I would be glad to accept any Amendment which would meet the noble and learned Lord's objection. That it is desirable to have places for the recreation of the public is freely admitted, even by such a strenuous advocate of temperance as Sir Thomas Whittaker. In a document which he presented, and which was embodied in the Report of the Royal Commission that sat under the presidency of Viscount Peel, Sir Thomas Whittaker said&#x2014;
<quote>"Places where persons may meet indoors for recreation and social intercourse are a necessity of our modern life."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0118"/>
<col>229</col>
He went on to disclose his plan of meeting this want by further fining existing public-houses so that the community could, at the expense of the public-houses, provide institutes or halls for public recreation. At page 154 of their Report the Royal Commission say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not, of course, to be inferred that, even if it were possible, people should be prohibited from hearing music or dancing to it, or should be precluded when doing so from obtaining refreshments."</quote>
My Bill does not go nearly so far as that, because I expressly exclude dancing. At page 127 the Royal Commission say&#x2014;
<quote>"Public-houses should, is our opinion, be as open as possible to supervision, both from the inside and the outside, and this in the common interest both of licence-holders and of the public."</quote>
That is the sole object of my Bill&#x2014;namely, that public-houses should be more open, not only to police supervision, but the supervision which would be brought about by respectable people being encouraged to use public-houses for social and pleasurable intercourse.<lb/>
If this Bill were allowed to pass, I do not suppose that there would be a great revolution in the character of public-houses. It is not intended to represent that all licensing authorities are so very narrow-minded in their views. It is chiefly in the large towns, and, perhaps, in London, where they are found largely to hamper improvements in public-houses. These improvements could only be effected at great expense, and therefore it would be a longtime before any large scheme of reform would be carried out throughout the length and breadth of the land. The movement has already taken root through the Public-house Trusts, and only this afternoon before coming down to the House I was told by Mr. Adeane, who is connected with one of these Trusts in Cambridgeshire, how remarkable had been the effect of the improvement in the Trust public-houses. Their object had been to raise the tone of public-houses and render them more open to respectable people, and this had been attended with such success that where any of these improved public-houses were situated the ordinary public-house had to, if possible, follow suit, as otherwise the competition was too severe.<lb/>
Your Lordships know what, in olden days, was the usual custom in regard to
<col>230</col>
canteens. Now at Aldershot there are large commodious rooms; and by the provision of healthy recreation and other means of enjoyment every encouragement is given to soldiers to frequent them. All that I seek to do by my Bill is to try to improve the conditions now prevailing throughout the country, and I am quite prepared to accept any Amendments so long as they do not injure the principle of the Bill. I think that with the wealth of legal talent we possess in this House, it should be quite possible to pass a Bill which would prevent arbitrary authorities from stopping improvements which would benefit the people and at the same time would not offer greater facilities for the consumption of intoxicants. We know what an improvement has taken place in the structure of ordinary shops throughout the country. Many of your Lordships will remember, as I can, that in former days we saw hung outside butchers' shops carcases covered with flies, against which the people jostled. Now these carcases are housed in tiled shops, with cold water running down to keep the atmosphere cool. Why should not our fellow citizens who frequent public-houses be allowed to enjoy social and pleasurable intercourse in modern and decent surroundings?<lb/>
I should like to read, as very apposite, a newspaper cutting which I happened by chance to see <i>apropos</i> of the development now taking place la Scotland in the running of steamers on the Clyde on the Sabbath. The writer draws a contrast between the customs that prevailed fifty years ago and those prevailing now, and goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The moral, of course, is: make a thing reasonable and above board, and it is not intrinsically evil, the harm in it will evaporate&#x2014;a maxim which some people regret was not applied to our national drinking customs."</quote>
That puts the whole object of my Bill, the Second Reading of which I now beg to move, and I trust that your Lordships will allow the Motion to be carried.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0002P0I0119"/>
<col>231</col>
Lord, I am quite sure, desires to see established something better than the horrid gin palaces that we see in the streets of great cities. I have not the least doubt that his object is to provide something more wholesome, and, if I might say so, more decent, and there is no doubt at all that the habits of the people on the Continent in regard to refreshment houses and <i>caf&#x00E9;s</i> afford a very pleasing contrast to the condition of things in our centres of population. How far that is due to the habits of the people, to the difference of climate, or the difference of liquor I do not pretend to say; but it would be a very good thing if a system of open places of refreshment and entertainment were substituted for what we have in this country. I think everybody would agree with that. But the noble, Lord appeared to think that we are precluded from having that now. There never was a greater mistake. I agree that it is practically prevented by the impossibility of getting the land in towns and cities; but it is not prevented by law. The magistrates in each locality have a perfect right to grant this permission if they think it right to do so. It rests with the discretion of the justices in the locality. What the noble Lord wishes to do is to prevent it remaining in the discretion of the justices, and to impose upon them by Act of Parliament the obligation of allowing these things whether they approve of them or not. That is the sting of the Bill of the noble Lord.<lb/>
Let us see how Clause I deals with the subject. It enumerates five classes of structural alterations, most of them very attractive. The first four are&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) The provision of accommodation for the supply of food or light refreshments;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) The making of such premises, or any part thereof, more open, airy, commodious, or comfortable;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) The improvement or enlargement of the sanitary accommodation;</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) The substitution of the provision of chairs and tables either wholly or partly in lieu of existing bar accommodation.</li></ol>
Excellent! But the really serious part of these proposals is the fifth, which provides that the licensing justices shall not be at liberty to prevent&#x2014;for that is what it conies to&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>e</i>) The provision of games, newspapers, music, or gardens, or any other means of reasonable recreation.</li></ol>
<col>232</col>
Let me apply that to any of the public-houses you see in the streets of London. They are to be at liberty to have just what music they like.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00629"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: No; I said automatic.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00630"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The proviso at the end of the clause would enact that the discretion of the justices is to be overruled; they are not to be allowed, in exercising their powers as to granting permission for alterations, to interfere with the provision of games, music, and so forth. Are you prepared to say that, whatever the justices may think is right or wrong, they should be obliged to give the facilities specified in every public-house, regardless of the question whether the result is likely to be beneficial or mischievous? The proper course seems to me to be to respect the discretion of the people possessing local knowledge. It is not possible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule. What may be good in a country place may be injurious in a large city. The proviso to which I referred a moment ago runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided always that no alteration in the premises or fittings the chief effect of which would be, in the opinion of the licensing justices, to increase the consumption of intoxicating liquors only, shall be deemed to come within the provisions of this section."</quote>
If there is something else they are to be deprived of their discretion. I believe the noble Lord has a good object at heart, and therefore I do not like to seem to oppose his proposals. I believe he wants what many of us would be very glad to see, but I do not believe it is right or reasonable to try and effect the object&#x2014;however good one may think it&#x2014;by means which are impracticable, namely, by depriving the justices on the spot of the right to exercise their own discretion, and imposing upon them a cast-iron rule that they should not refuse these things whether they think them in the interest of the public or not. I prefer to leave discretion to the people on the spot.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00631"><sup>*</sup><member>TRE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord who introduced this Bill was only stating what is notoriously the case when he said that there was a widespread desire for legislation upon these lines, and I am sure that that desire is widespread not only out of doors but in
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0120"/>
<col>233</col>
this House. Those who followed out the long discussions on the Licensing Bill last year must remember how, throughout those discussions, a desire was expressed again and again that something should be done to deal with this part of the temperance question&#x2014;that something should be done to make the places in which intoxicating liquors are sold less of the character of mere drinking shops and more of the character of places in which people can obtain reasonable recreation, social intercourse, and harmless refreshments.<lb/>
My noble friend has made in this Bill an honest and sincere effort to bring about a change of this kind. I certainly came here fully inclined to support him. I should have supported him last year if it had not been for two things&#x2014;first, that other legislation dealing with the question of the consumption of liquor was imminent; and, secondly, that on that occasion also the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack pointed out to us that there were technical difficulties, or I would say, perhaps, more than technical difficulties, in the particular proposals which my noble friend then submitted to the House. I am, I confess, discouraged by the statement which has just been made by the noble and learned Lord. I am not going to be so presumptuous as to question his statement with regard to the present condition of the law; but, quite apart from the present condition of the law, is it not notorious that the practice of the magistrates has been to discourage, or, at any rate, to give no facilities for, alterations in public-house premises designed to bring about the kind of improved conditions which my noble friend desires to promote? I make the suggestion with very great deference, but feeling as we do so strongly on the subject of the intentions which are expressed in this Bill, is this not a case where the House might safely give a Second Reading to the Bill with the reservation that when we get into Committee we should consider whether we could not overcome some of these difficulties&#x2014;real difficulties, no doubt&#x2014;to which the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has pointed. That is the only suggestion which I have to make, and I lay it humbly before your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00632"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had rather hoped to have heard a somewhat fuller
<col>234</col>
exposition on the part of the noble Lord and of those who agree with him of the way in which this Bill would work out in Practice. I join to the full in the tribute which has been paid to the noble Lord for the interest he has taken in the matter, and for the way in which he has put the case, in its elements at least, before us. I am certain that the more this subject and subjects kindred to it are ventilated the better. People should be encouraged to take every opportunity of making experiments and trying different modes of improving, by indirect as well as by direct legislative means, the condition of the liquor trade both as regards the sale and the consumption of intoxicants.<lb/>
But I cannot help drawing a somewhat clear distinction in my own mind between the admirable object of the noble Lord and others who support the Bill and the practical effect which the Bill would have in face of the conditions in which it would be applied to-day. I am entirely with the noble Lord in his object. I do not think he would accuse me of being one of those who would take exception to legislation of this kind on narrow and bigoted lines, or on the ground that it is going to improve the condition of these places. Quite the contrary. I have been a promoter of the Public-house Trust, and if I had thought this Bill was going to effect the purpose which those of us had in view in promoting the Public-house Trust I would say, "By all means let the matter go forward." But the more I look at it the more difficult I feel it to say that.<lb/>
I do not think that for what it is proposed to effect by the Bill legislation is really required, or if it be, I believe the practical results would be different from the aim which the noble Lord has at heart. Does experience show that magistrates are to any great extent trying to prevent the establishment of the kind of public-houses which are under discussion? I do not say it may not have happened in a solitary instance here and there, but to say that magistrates generally are trying to prevent this kind of improvement in public-houses&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00633"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I did not say generally, but in certain places.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0121"/>
<col>235</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00634"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: There may be some particular cases in which the magistrates, actuated by arguments not fully before the House, have refused facilities; but I have not found in a considerable range of inquiry, that ordinary experience shows that the licensing magistrates have been trying to use their power to prevent the kind of change in public-houses which the noble Lord wishes to promote. I am afraid the absence of such change has been due to a totally different cause&#x2014;namely, a belief that it paid better to conduct public-houses on the old lines. If the magistrates were deprived of the discretion they now have in respect to the substitution of chairs and tables for bar accommodation and the provision of means of recreation, I doubt very much whether the effect would really be in the direction which the noble Lord desires. As to the provision of accommodation for the supply of food or light refreshments, the making of public-house premises more open, airy, commodious or comfortable, and the improvement or enlargement of the sanitary accommodation&#x2014;I can only say that if magistrates have refused permission for such improvements on the grounds stated by the noble Lord I have not come across such cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00635"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I could give you cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00636"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: I, of course, accept the noble Lord's assurance, but I am sure the cases must be few and far between. And when we come to the other proposals referred to it is obvious, as the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack pointed out, that large and difficult questions are raised. They are matters which in practice call for the utmost caution, though I am by no means prepared to say that it would be undesirable that something of that kind should be permitted. I believe that substantially there is no practical legal difficulty to-day in going far in the direction desired, where people are really prepared to make the experiment. It is because I do not think that the result wished for would be produced by the Bill that I find it exceedingly difficult to see what would be gained by giving it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<col>236</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00637"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that I welcomed one of the observations made by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack&#x2014;namely, that you should not lay down hard-and-fast lines, but leave a great deal to discretion. That is quite true. But I think the error that has been committed, and which this Bill is intended to remedy, is an error which has arisen through the practice of the magistrates. My noble friend behind me, on the last occasion that this Bill was before the House, quoted the observation of a magistrate when told that a certain proposal would improve the state of the public-houses in his district. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We do not want to improve them. We want to improve them out of existence altogether."</quote>
That, as I understand, is not the policy which the most rev. Primate himself advocates. I fully believe it, and if the most rev. Primate were himself a magistrate deciding this question I should leave it with absolute confidence in his hands.<lb/>
But, unfortunately, there has been for a considerable period an effort to make public-houses disagreeable, and it has been avowed. I do not think that is within the proper discretion of the magistrates at all; and although I give them credit for having done what they did with every desire for the benefit of the State, yet I think they have proceeded upon the theory that they have a right to establish a policy, and I do not think they have that right. They have to exercise the jurisdiction given them by law, and that does not exist in making things disagreeable, but in providing proper accommodation for the public. The difficulty is that people will have these accommodations, and the result of the, as I think, unfortunate policy of the justices has often been to establish the club in the place of the public-house. The club is not under any supervision or jurisdiction of the magistrates, and the result of that has been to establish a large number of clubs which are by no means useful to the neighbourhood or likely to promote temperance. The effort of my noble friend behind me is to get rid of that, to get rid of the idea that persons in the lower class of life should not have places to which they can invite their friends and in which they can enjoy social intercourse and games. The
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0122"/>
<col>237</col>
only way to accomplish this is to allow a reasonable discretion in regard to the provision of such music, games and so forth as may be appropriate. But that cannot be brought about unless in some way the Legislature points out to the justices that they are not there to establish any theory of their own but to administer the law as it stands. Though I believe the magistrates have on the whole done their duty faithfully and earnestly for the public good, they have from time to time entertained the idea that they are going by their policy to improve the temperance of the people. I do not believe they will.<lb/>
As to the question whether the multiplication of public-houses increases drinking, that has been negatived by statistics. I cannot help feeling that it would be a great advantage, particularly in country districts, to have some place in which the people could amuse themselves. I presided at a meeting on that subject, and read a letter from Lord Roberts, who, speaking from his own experience of the canteens in India, testified to the admirable improvement that had taken place since the introduction of very much the same thing as the noble Lord behind me desires to introduce into the public-houses in this country. If it is a natural and reasonable want the people will have it, and if you do not afford it to them in public-houses, which are subject to supervision, there will be set up clubs subject to no supervision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00638"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to make one suggestion to the noble Lord who has brought in this excellent Bill by which, I think, he could easily get over the difficulties that have been propounded. It is clear, after the declaration by the Lord Chancellor and by the noble and learned Earl who has just addressed us, that no Bill will pass with their assent which in any way hampers the discretion of the justices. I think the general feeling of the House is in favour of the changes which have been adumbrated by Lord Halsbury. The whole House is in favour of doing something, if possible, which would not interfere with the magistrates but improve the public-houses. I think the Bill is an excellent Bill, as it aims at turning public-houses into <i>caf&#x00E9;s</i>, such as exist in Vienna and Paris, where working-men and their wives and families can go and spend a pleasant evening with amusement.

venture to suggest that if, in the clause stating that in exercising their powers magistrates should not do so in such manner as to interfere with certain facilities and improvements, the words "not do so in such manner as to interfere with" were omitted and replaced by the words "have regard to" the objection raised by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack would he removed, and the way would be paved in a tentative manner for the justices taking the hint given by the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

Therefore, it seems conclusive that we ought to read the Bill a second time. I do not, without further consideration, desire to commit myself to the precise method which the noble Lord has suggested. It is evident that more than one method might be proposed by which Parliament could place upon record its view that in the general case those facilities should be accorded. Some provision may have to be inserted that the discretion of the magistrates is to be preserved in the last resort and in special cases, but that as a general rule the object of my noble friend behind me should be carried out. All this shows that the Bill should be read a second time, and we on this Bench hope your Lordships will consent to the Motion.</membercontribution></p>

What the Bill practically means is to take away the powers of the justices as they at present exist, because it is said, though it has not been proved, that in some cases those powers have been abused, and the justices have made the public-houses disagreeable. We on this side would not in any way attempt to oppose the suggestion which has just been made by the noble Marquess opposite, and we are content to have made our protest against the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COUNTY COURTS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00642" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00643">Order of the Day for the second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00644"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall occupy but a short space of time in stating to your Lordships what has to be stated in moving the Second Reading of this Bill. The greater part of the Bill consists of clauses which have already received the assent of this House on more than one occasion, and most of them have been borrowed from the proposals of the noble and learned Earl who was my predecessor on the Woolsack. But in the Bill this year there is a proposal which requires a little notice.<lb/>
It is proposed that in regard to County Courts the jurisdiction shall be without limit subject to two important limitations. One is that a class of cases which has always been considered unsuitable for trial in County Courts, is excepted, and the other is that, though a plaintiff may begin his action in the County Court for any sum of money, the defendant is at liberty, by a very simple process, to require that the case shall be tried in the High Court of Justice as now. The effect is that, if both parties to an action agree, any case, with certain few exceptions, can be tried in a County Court.<lb/>
The proposal of the Bill in this respect has its immediate genesis in the Report of the Committee presided over by my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell, to whom I have to express my gratitude and to whom I believe the public at large is indebted very greatly for the trouble and wisdom with which the inquiry was conducted. But although the immediate genesis of this Bill is to be found in the Report to which I have referred, it must not be supposed that the Bill has not an earlier history. It will illustrate the rapidity with which we approach law reform in this country when I tell your Lordships that this proposal was made by a Royal Commission forty years ago, and a Bill substantially on the lines of that now presented was brought in thirty years ago by no less a man than Lord Cairns, but it was laid aside I do not know for what reason.<lb/>
<col>240</col>
Upon two subjects involved in the proposal to extend the jurisdiction of County Courts I have designedly not touched in the present Bill. The first is the right of audience by advocates. As your Lordships know, in the County Courts a solicitor can be heard as an advocate, while in the High Court members of the Bar alone have a right of audience. I will not enter upon that subject beyond saying that I entirely agree with what is said in this report by my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell as to the great importance of having a strong Bar in this country. I believe it is a great protection to the innocent, and a great protection also against any encroachment by Judges, if any be designed, upon the public liberties. Although the Bill does not touch upon the subject, I need hardly say that if the Bar and the Law Society, the two branches of the legal profession, agree upon any proposal which would be in the public interest, I would be happy to give it consideration.<lb/>
Another point requiring notice is that in the Report of Lord Gorell's Committee there were reasoned proposals concerning the extension of jurisdiction in divorce. That is a subject of great importance, and I anticipate that an interesting debate will arise upon the Motion of which Lord Gorell has given notice concerning it. But while agreeing with the proposals which Lord Gorell makes, I know well the nature of the controversy that is likely to arise, and in my opinion it would fatally impede this Bill to introduce those proposals into it. The conditional extension of the jurisdiction of County Courts will, I believe, be welcomed, and certainly it cannot be regarded as a rash arrangement when it is remembered that it had the support of Lord Cairns. It seems possible that it will be a great boon in many cases, and that many people will be likely to have recourse to County Courts to obtain a settlement of their differences. I cherish the hope that the Bill will be passed by both Houses of Parliament without any real difficulty.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0002P0I0124"/>
<col>241</col>
connection with which he has expressed himself in a very kind way, to say a few words as to some of the points which, I think, deserve consideration in this Bill. There are some matters of omission and some which are inserted which will, I think, give rise to considerable questions. The first one on which I wish to say a word is the extension of jurisdiction in divorce. It formed the subject of very careful inquiry before the Committee over which I had the honour of presiding, but it was felt, in dealing with a Bill which was concerned chiefly with the jurisdiction of County Courts in matters which had been frequently the subject of discussion and which had been very fully considered from time to time, that its introduction into such a Bill was inadvisable, and that it was desirable that it should be left to be dealt with entirely separately. Having that Report behind me, I ventured to put down the Motion which stands in my name for next week, and that is the time at which anything that is worthy of being said by myself on this subject will be brought before your Lordships.<lb/>
There is one other matter of omission from this Bill&#x2014;a Bill which, in substance, deals with all the points with which the Committee's Report was concerned, except the extension of jurisdiction in divorce. I wish to draw attention to this because I think it has a very great bearing upon matters which affect the amount of business that can be done in the County Courts. It is that this Bill omits to deal with the question of the committal of persons who have the misfortune to be unable to pay their debts. The reason why the Committee over which I presided did not touch that matter was that another Committee was dealing with it, and with that Committee sitting we felt that it was not within our powers and not desirable that we should touch the question of committal. I think there is a general opinion that the extent of the business of the County Courts, and with that, of course, the amount of work which the Judges can do and might be expected to do, depends very largely on whether the ultimate result is to retain the power to commit or not. If that were not retained, I have been given to understand that a very large portion of the business of the County Courts might find itself at an end; and that, of course, would affect questions which deal with the distribution of County Court Judges' work
<col>242</col>
and the power that they would have to do increased work under the extended jurisdiction proposed in this Bill.<lb/>
The Bill itself appears to deal with three sets of matters. The latter clauses are mainly concerned with questions which, understand, have already been before this House and have met with approval here, and there really is practically nothing new to say with regard to them. Most of the other part of the Bill deals with matters about which there practically can be no controversy. They are amendments of the procedure in County Courts, amendments of the mode of dealing with its business, and certain increased powers, all of which facilitate the working of the County Courts in the disposal of their business. But Clause 1 of the Bill does introduce an entirely new state of things. It extends the jurisdiction of the County Court to an unlimited amount in all Common Law cases, but gives the power to the defendant to remove a case which exceeds the present limits of the jurisdiction of the County Court to the High Court if he so desires. I wish to make a few observations about that part of the Bill.<lb/>
The Committee who reported upon this matter had a difference of opinion upon a very vital point in connection with the extension of the jurisdiction. The Committee, if I remember rightly, was more or less evenly divided on this subject, and I wish that the House should understand exactly what that division amounted to and the points to which it gave rise in connection with this subject. The Committee came to the conclusion that there had been a very considerable decline of business in the various branches of work done by the High Court throughout the country on Circuit, and that there had arisen dissatisfaction in the different parts of the country visited by the Circuits because it was considered that the arrangements made for the disposal of Common Law cases throughout the country were not at present up to date. I do not propose to specify at length any of the cases which have led to that dissatisfaction. They are to be found set out in the Report which has been laid before the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and circulated to your Lordships. The substance of them is that, with the present-day length of cases, with the heavy work and additional duties which have to be performed by
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0125"/>
<col>243</col>
the Judges, it is difficult to give sufficient time on Circuit to dispose properly of the business without hurry and inconvenience. The conclusion the Committee came to was that the Circuit system should be remodelled so as to concentrate the Civil work in centres, and that more time should be allowed and more convenient arrangements made for the disposal of business.<lb/>
The reason why I draw attention to that is this, that if the state of things is such that people are not able to have their cases satisfactorily disposed of at the Assizes, the extension of the jurisdiction in the way the Bill proposes will naturally tend to drive into the County Courts a quantity of business which, in the view of those with whom I sided on the Committee, ought to be dealt with by the High Court. I might be permitted to read two sentences from the Report, which will explain the difference of opinion that arose&#x2014;
<quote>"We are strongly of opinion that the true remedy to be sought for is not by encouraging litigants to contest their cases in Courts which were not intended to deal with those cases, and must, for the reasons already given, find difficulties and be at a disadvantage in attempting to do so, but to provide that completely adequate facilities should be given by the High Court for disposing of every case which it is reasonable should be both commenced and continued in it. At the same time we have to recognise the fact that a considerable number of cases between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;100 are now launched in the County Court, and a further number of over &#x00A3;100 are taken there by consent, and that some demand appears to exist in some quarters for a further facility to try in County Courts particular Common Law cases suitable to be tried there but exceeding the money limit triable except by written consent, and in which cases written consent is sometimes refused because it is sometimes asked for by the opponent."</quote>
The opinion of those who took the view I took on this Committee was that if the suggestions we made with regard to concentration of business on Circuit and other facilities were carried out, then the proposal to extend the jurisdiction of the County Court might be accepted. But we did not wish to see extension given without those facilities at the same time being put forward&#x2014;that is to say, the two improvements should go hand in hand. On the other hand, some members of the Committee took the view that they were two independent matters, that the extension of the jurisdiction of the County Court should be proceeded with entirely independent of the other matter. I wish to put that forward as a subject for con-
<col>244</col>
sideration on the part of His Majesty's Government, because the view, shortly put, of myself and others is that the true remedy in these matters is that the persons who wish it should have absolutely easy and facile opportunities on Circuit of disposing of their cases in the High Court, and that they should not be forced, if they should not so desire it, to go to the County Court because they had not adequate opportunities elsewhere.<lb/>
I am particularly desirous that this should be brought fully forward because considerable misapprehension has existed on the subject. We were extremely desirous that the general proposals in this Report should be adopted, but that it should be a condition that those which affected the jurisdiction of the County Court should go hand in hand with the reforms suggested in the Circuit system. The Bill at present makes them entirely independent, and. I feel a difficulty in saying very much about this because your Lordships are aware that a Committee has already been appointed to consider further matters which to a certain extent appear in the Report to which I have already referred, and I should hope, if they take a view at all similar to that expressed in the Report, that any such dissatisfaction and difficulty as I have alluded to might be removed. In such a case as that there is no objection that I can see to the extension of the jurisdiction.<lb/>
There is one other matter on which I would venture to say a few words. It is upon the question of audience. Upon that this Report is also in a sense silent, because it contains no recommendation regarding it. That is so because at that time it was impossible to know exactly what proposals the Government would adopt with regard to this Bill and with regard to the improvement of work on the Circuits. But the Report contains a very strong expression of opinion with regard to retaining the rights of audience in cases where the jurisdiction is to be extended. There was some difference of opinion about it, but the Report contains this paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"Notwithstanding the difficulties in our system which undoubtedly exist and for which we have been asked to suggest remedies, the fact remains that the administration of justice in Civil cases as well as in criminal is more satisfactory than in any other country in the world, and not only our own countrymen but foreigners respect it and even voluntarily resort to our tribunals. We believe
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0126"/>
<col>245</col>
that this is due in great measure to the unique position of the Bar, and that any change in the jurisdiction of our superior and inferior Courts which would substantially alter that position would have very far-reaching consequences."</quote>
I would venture to suggest that, although this matter has not been dealt with in the Bill as it at present stands, after what my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack has said it might be open to those who take the view that it should be dealt with to move in Committee a clause dealing with the subject. I think that where the object of this extended jurisdiction is to put before the Courts which at present have not got that jurisdiction the opportunities of doing work which at present can only be done in the High Court, it might be desirable that the right of audience should be preserved as it is to the extent to which it at present exists in the High Court in such cases. But I desire to have an opportunity of suggesting what might be done on that subject when the Bill is in Committee. At this stage it seemed to me desirable to call attention to those two or three particular points, not with the object in any way of suggesting that this Bill should not be read a second time, but of indicating matters which should be fully considered when the Bill is in Committee of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00647"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suppose no one doubts that this Bill will be read a second time, because it contains a good many valuable provisions. But undoubtedly there are one or two points which it is impossible to pass over without a protest, and when we come to the discussion in Committee the objections to them will be more properly put before your Lordships. I protest most strongly against the extension of jurisdiction. I think County Court Judges have neither the time nor the opportunity for dealing with questions of this sort, which sometimes occupy a great many days. The effect of that on the County Court, which was primarily established for the purpose of dealing with small matters, would be to exclude those small matters from its jurisdiction. I will say more upon that when we reach the Committee stage. I think the other questions to which my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell has just referred are also of very great importance and cannot be passed over when we come to deal with this matter in Committee. On the whole, I should be very sorry if the Bill were not read a second time. It is a valuable
<col>246</col>
Bill, and I should regret it if it were lost; but there are one or two principles in it which it will be my duty to oppose when we go into Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00648"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill raises such very important questions that even at the risk of detaining your Lordships I desire to say a few words. I need not assure the Lord Chancellor that he will have my assistance in passing the larger number of the provisions of the Bill as they effect valuable improvements. With regard to the proposal that any ordinary Common Law action may be commenced in the County Court, of course if there is given an absolute right to a defendant to remove a case into the High Court, not much harm can be done, and probably it may be an experiment worth trying. No one has a greater veneration for the memory of Lord Cairns than I have, but I do not think that with regard to this particular matter we have any evidence at all of what I may call the considered and reasoned judgment of Lord Cairns, nor was it a matter of which he had from his practice any very great experience. If it is going to be supposed that by this Bill there will be a large number of actions tried in the County Courts which, under present circumstances, are heard in the King's Bench, I am satisfied they will create disaster in the work of the County Courts. In such an event the Lord Chancellor would have to face either a complete alteration in the method in which cases are heard in the County Court or a very large extension of the County Court Bench. The business has to be done either in the County Court or in the High Court. If it is to be done in the High Court you must make proper provision both in London and on Circuit, and it must not be thought that by simply allowing any action to be brought in the County Court you are getting over the difficulty of congestion which is staring you in the face.<lb/>
I should also like to pay a tribute to the admirable work discharged by the Committee over which Lord Gorell presided. But there are one or two matters in this Bill which were not touched by the Report of the Committee. There is the question of the extension of the jurisdiction of the Registrar. Here, again, I think the clause requires careful consideration, though I say at once that the Lord Chancellor has wisely met one of the main objections taken to the extension of this jurisdiction. In all dis-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0127"/>
<col>247</col>
puted cases the litigant in the County Court is entitled to the judgment of the Judge. Again we get into the same difficulty. It is not by giving the Registrar additional jurisdiction that you get rid of any possible congestion of business, and that clause will require careful consideration.<lb/>
The Bill provides, for the first time, power to have special sittings in the County Court for the trial of special classes of cases. That is a matter which requires careful consideration, and the provisions of the Bill will need to be closely scrutinised when we get into Committee. I hope that, even if the difficulties are found to be such that these particular clauses are not able to pass, it will by no means necessitate the loss of the Bill, but that the remainder of the clauses will be carried. This Bill provides, for the first time, that in cases of appeals between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;100 the decision of the County Court Judge on a question of fact shall not be final. It says that on both questions of mixed fact and law and of fact there shall be a new right of appeal. I should be very glad to see that for many reasons, but it will involve considerable additional labour on the High Court; and if the power is largely exercised of allowing further evidence to be taken it will cause, of course, considerable extra delay in the hearing of appeals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00649"><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: What is the number of that clause?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00650"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: Clause 13, subsection (1). It runs&#x2014;
<quote>"In addition to the right given by section one hundred and twenty of the principal Act to appeal to the High Court against the decision of a County Court on a point of law any party to an action or matter in which the sum claimed or the amount involved exceeds fifty pounds shall have the right to appeal to the High Court against the decision of a County Court on a ground involving a question of fact alone or of mixed law and fact."</quote>
The second subsection provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"In section one hundred and twenty-two of the principal Act (which relates to the powers of the High Court on hearing an appeal), after the words 'any inference of fact' there shall be inserted the words 'and where the appeal is an appeal on a ground involving a question of fact to receive further evidence upon question of fact such evidence to be either by oral examination in Court or by affidavit or by deposition taken before an examiner or commissioner.'"</quote>
I only mention these matters to show that the Bill contains many points which
<col>248</col>
go far beyond the subjects referred to by the Lord Chancellor as being matters on which there is universal consent, and I hope that an opportunity will be given to discuss and to consider them fully in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00651"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not my intention to prolong this discussion. The Bill is one of the highest importance. It bristles with difficulties, and it is obvious that there has not been time to examine the provisions with the care they deserve. I reserve to myself full right to criticise them at length in Committee. The last topic referred to by the Lord Chief Justice&#x2014;the question of appeals&#x2014;is of the greatest importance. At present, as the law stands in England, there is no real right of appeal from County Courts. There never was anything more unsatisfactory than the present system of appeal from those Courts. My noble and learned friend who has just sat down pointed out that this is sought to be widened, but sought inefficiently. This is a point which will have to be fully considered in Committee. In Ireland there is a successful system whereby every suitor who is dissatisfied with the decision of a County Court Judge can appeal on the spot to a Civil Judge, and at very slight expense and in a short time the whole matter is heard and disposed of. I hope that the Bill will be read a second time and will become law after changes have been made in it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00652"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not detain you long in replying. I will say nothing more on the subject of audience, because, as I have said, we leave the right in the County Court as it is, and if the profession could agree to something reasonable we should be prepared to consider carefully any proposals made. Allow me to point out this, that here is a proposal enabling parties, if they both agree to do so, to try their disputes in a cheap local Court. Lord Cairns supported this proposal thirty years ago, and it cannot be supposed that the scheme is going to be opposed now. It is said that it will congest the Courts and overburden the Judges; but I would point out that there are provisions in the Bill for extending the jurisdiction of the Registrar to try small cases under &#x00A3;5. In my belief it is essential to the public interest that people should not be prevented from settling their disputes when they are agreed that a Court cheap and handy at their doors may entertain them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0128"/>
<col>249</col>
The only other matter I need refer to is the reference to the Circuit system. In regard to that some very valuable suggestions were made by my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell in his Report. The Lord Chief Justice and I have endeavoured, and I hope that we shall succeed, to provide that there shall not be any hurry or congestion on Circuit. I think that our proposals have already given satisfaction. I do not suggest that this Bill deals with the congestion in the King's Bench Division, though I think that it may contribute towards the lightening of the work of that Division. But that depends upon quite different considerations in regard to which there is to be an inquiry by a Joint Committee of both Houses. I am glad that this Bill is to be read a second time. I am anxious above every-
<col>250</col>
thing to make the administration of justice cheap, easy, and handy, so that people may approach the Court without having all the apprehensions of the expense involved in coming from, say, Cornwall or Devon up to London. We do not pretend that we are original in this scheme; on the contrary, I am only following in the footsteps of one of the greatest among my predecessors, and I hope that we shall have real sympathy in advancing this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE LATE MARQUESS OF RIPON.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00670"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we proceed to the business of the day I feel sure that I shall be acting in conformity with your Lordships' wishes if I endeavour very briefly to express the general sense of the loss which has been sustained by this House and by the whole country in the death of Lord Ripon, who was so lately with us. Lord Ripon was literally cradled in politics. As many of your Lordships know, he was born at No. 10, Downing-street, during the brief tenure by his father of the office of Prime Minister in 1827. He entered the House of Commons in early life; he obtained office early, and he went on to occupy many of the most important posts both in England and in the Empire, always with distinction and always honourably. Lord Ripon possessed many of the qualities which make for success in public life, but I think his most distinctive quality was that one of courage, without which all others, whether it be Parliamentary eloquence or official industry, or adroitness in the management of affairs, are indeed but sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. Lord Ripon was never afraid of an opponent; and he possessed the even rarer and more valuable quality of never being afraid of a supporter. In addition to that, as many of your Lordships here know, he was one of the most genial of men, always delighting in the successes of younger men and willing to assist them from the rich stores of his experience. At the same time, he was not one of those who suffered fools gladly, or was particularly tolerant of inefficiency in any branch of life. His was, on the whole, a very happy life, I feel sure, and an enviable career. He was, as has been the good fortune of many other public men, singularly happy in his marriage and the circumstances of his home. When the time came for him to lay down the heavy burden of office he retired from your Lordships' House without ostentation, but he did not cease to take a keen interest in public affairs. Only a very few days ago I received a letter from him, dictated, indeed, and signed with a trembling hand, but still full of vivid interest in current affairs. I feel certain that he will not be easily forgotten in this House. To us who were his colleagues, and to any one like myself who have known him all my life, the loss of a friend and a counsellor
<col>254</col>
is irreparable; but I am equally sure that to your Lordships generally the disappearance from this scene of so kindly, so generous, and so distinctive a figure will be universally regretted. We feel, too, that with the departure of Lord Ripon the gates seem to close on a great historical era. He sat in the Cabinet with Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell, and many other famous men who are no longer here; but I feel that the recollections of him which we shall all retain, whether we agreed with his views on party politics or not, will always be an encouragement to us in the conduct of public affairs and that we shall look back upon his example as that of a brave British statesman.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00671"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just spoken evidently felt, and felt rightly, that in paying his eloquent tribute to the memory of Lord Ripon he spoke not only for himself and for those who sit near him, but for the whole of this House. Lord Ripon's title to public respect certainly stands very high indeed, and nowhere, I venture to think, had he earned a higher title to respect than in the House of Lords. He has gone down to his grave having to his credit a career which extended over no less than sixty years, a career of energy, of useful application to great public objects; and we in this House may reflect with pride that no less than fifty out of those sixty years were spent in your Lordships' House. It happens that during forty of those fifty years I have had the honour of a seat in this House, and I have, therefore, perhaps as good a right as most of your Lordships to bear my humble testimony to the honourable part which Lord Ripon always took in our proceedings. I never knew a member of this House who kept more closely in touch with its business or who took a more honourable part in our deliberations. Lord Ripon filled many high offices. He probably filled most of the offices to which a Peer can aspire. His work will, no doubt, be variously judged according to the standpoint of those who pass judgment upon it; but I think all will give him credit for having been a painstaking and conscientious administrator, and for that quality of courage which the noble Earl so especially attributed to him. It fell to Lord Ripon's lot to lead this House and also to lead the Opposition in this House; and we have often admired the admirable tact with which he acquitted himself in those difficult positions. It is no exaggeration to say that
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0131"/>
<col>255</col>
whether in or out of office he commanded the good will of both sides of the House, and that he never left any feeling of resentment in the minds of those from whom it was often his duty to differ. As a debater it always seemed to me that Lord Ripon was entitled to no mean position. His style was perhaps what some of us would now consider a little old-fashioned, but his fire and the energy of his speech recalled those great Victorian statesmen of whom, as the noble Earl told us just now, Lord Ripon was for so many years a colleague. Lord Ripon's death leaves a great blank in this House. We all of us regret him, and we on this side of the House are glad to join you in doing honour to his memory.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NATIONAL SERVICE (TRAINING AND<lb/> HOME DEFENCE) BILL. [H.L]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00672" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00673">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00674"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is not the first time that I have addressed your Lordships on the all-important subject of our national security. But to-day I want to ask you to do something more than merely to consider the general aspect of the question. I want to ask you to take definite action in order to bring home to the public mind the gravity of the situation, and in order to fix the attention of the country on what I regard as the only satisfactory solution of our present difficulties.<lb/>
It may be said that the country is not yet ready for such a change as is proposed in the Bill I have now the honour to bring before you, and that it is, therefore, undesirable that this House should be committed as approving of it. I can assure your Lordships that public opinion has advanced a great deal in the last few years, and in the last few months it has made more rapid progress towards the consummation desired by the National Service League than ever I could have dared to hope for. But, even if the country were less ready to accept the principle of universal military training than I believe it to be, is it not the duty of those who are agreed as to the desirability and necessity of national service to use their utmost efforts to convert their fellow-citizens to their point of view? The authority of
<col>256</col>
this House stands very high to-day in the eyes of the public, more especially with regard to those great national and Imperial questions on which so many of your Lordships can speak with exceptional experience. All the greater, I venture to submit, is our responsibility if we hesitate to take the lead or to give a clear and unmistakable expression of our convictions on a matter of such supreme importance as the safety of our country.<lb/>
I need not go at length into all the facts which have made it clear to me that our present system fails utterly to provide the necessary insurance against the dangers which may at any moment threaten us; nor need I recapitulate the arguments which have convinced me, and have convinced others who have made a careful study of the subject, that an invasion of this country is not only possible, but that it is possible on a far larger scale than has usually been assumed. I can only reiterate my conviction that our present military policy involves a wilful gambling with the safety of the country and of the Empire. It is incapable of providing a force sufficient to deal with the serious military problems which confront us in various parts of the Empire, or with the defence of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I know that even in this House many noble Lords believe that there is nothing seriously wrong with our military arrangements, and consider that it was exaggeration on my part to state, as I did a couple of months ago, that&#x2014;
<quote>"we have neither an Army to send abroad nor an Army with which to defend the country at home."</quote>
I was not exaggerating, I spoke nothing but the truth. That our Regular Army is quite excellent, as far as it goes, no one has better reason to know than I have. I believe it to be as good, if not better, than any army in the world; but, however good it is, the fact remains that the maximum force theoretically available for over-sea purposes is barely 150,000 men, and any consideration of the strategical requirements either of the defence of India, or of the self-governing Colonies, will show that such a force is entirely inadequate for the purpose. But, as a matter of fact, are 150,000 men really available to-day, or likely to be available in the future? Have we got, or are we likely to get, the officers, the seasoned men over twenty years of age, and the trained horses required to mobilise six big divisions?
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0132"/>
<col>257</col>
All the information that reaches me points to a very different conclusion, and there are the gravest doubts whether we could at this moment mobilise and send over-sea a force of more than about 100,000 men, leaving little else in this country than a number of recruits, lads under nineteen and twenty, and even less mature and less adequately trained Special Reservists.<lb/>
The same applies to the Territorial Force. I have nothing but admiration for the spirit in which its members devote their spare time to their patriotic task. There is no mistake about their patriotism. The mistake lies in assuming that the existence of this country can safely be entrusted to a force the training of which is limited to the few days which are all that can be given under the present adverse conditions, and the total strength of which, in spite of every sort of pressure, and in spite of social and journalistic influences, has not yet been brought up to the low establishment of 315,000. I am only too willing to acknowledge the soundness of Mr. Haldane's organisation, which, as Mr. Balfour said a few weeks ago&#x2014;
<quote>"may yet be the means of rendering priceless service to the country."</quote>
I have no desire to find fault or to magnify small imperfections. But I simply ask your Lordships whether any one can seriously believe that a force of some 300,000 practically untrained men, under untrained officers, with an amateur artillery armed with guns which are not of the latest type, a force scattered all over the United Kingdom, the greater part of which would necessarily be absorbed in garrisoning our ports and arsenals, could withstand the concentrated onset of possibly 150,000 of the most highly-trained and best organised troops in the world.<lb/>
The only standard by which our forces can be judged is that of the strength of the forces which they may be called upon to meet. I am only too well aware of the fact that the majority of our fellow-countrymen comfort themselves with the belief that a supremely powerful Navy is all that is needed to secure our safety, and that an Army, except for foreign service, is superfluous. There are even those who go so far as to accept as a truth the humiliating idea, ventilated more than once lately, that, if our Navy should be
<col>258</col>
even temporarily beaten, there would be an end to the British nation as well as to the British Empire. I have no doubt whatever that this ignominious <i>finale</i> will certainly be arrived at if, while our land forces are in their present deplorably weak condition, such a calamity as a naval defeat were to befall us. And the people of this country must decide whether they will court extinction by remaining unprepared to resist invasion should we, by any chance, temporarily lose the command of the home waters, or whether, by adopting the precautions which almost every other civilised nation has been forced to adopt, they will render these islands impregnable so long as our Fleets have absolute strategical freedom, and are able to keep the routes of our chief food supplies open.<lb/>
I do not propose to take up your time by again discussing the question whether an invasion is possible or not possible, or what our Navy can or cannot do; I said all I had to say on these points when I spoke in this House last November. Since then, indeed, some startling disclosures have been made as to the greater rapidity with which ships of war can be built in other countries than was understood to be possible even so short time ago. But as I hope this matter will be taken up during the debate by noble Lords who are more competent than I am to deal with it, I will content myself by pointing out with all the force I can, that the less certainty there is about our absolute supremacy at sea the more essential it is that we should be strong on land. I cannot say I am altogether surprised that the general public should pin their faith solely to the Navy, seeing that ever since Nelson's great victory at Trafalgar in 1805 our supremacy at sea has never been challenged. Before Trafalgar the French and Dutch each had a Navy which more than once held possession of the English Channel, and with which we had many a tough struggle for victory. It took some Years after Trafalgar before our naval supremacy was fully realised. This may be attributed to two facts, that it was not at Trafalgar, but at Waterloo&#x2014;ten years later&#x2014;that Napoleon was finally defeated, and that no great war had ever been decided by a naval victory. And so late as 1809 our people thought it necessary to submit to considerable self-sacrifice in order to provide a large army for home defence.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0133"/>
<col>259</col>
I doubt if it is generally known how great was that sacrifice, or how large was the army then considered necessary, and actually maintained for the defence of these islands. Even some of your Lordships may be astonished to hear that in 1809, when the population of the United Kingdom was less than 15,000,000, and when the revenue amounted to only &#x00A3;68,500,000, there were almost as many men under arms as there, are at the present time, when we have population of about 44,000,000 and a revenue of &#x00A3;151,500,000. Figures, my Lords, are wearisome, and sometimes untrustworthy, but I am hopeful that the accuracy of my figures will not be questioned when I tell you that those for 1809 are taken from that enlightening and instructive book, "The County Lieutenancies and the Army, 1803&#x2013;1814," recently published by Mr. John Fortescue, and those for 1909 from the latest Army Estimates and Mr. Haldane's own statements in the House of Commons. I venture to trouble your Lordships with these figures, as it seems to me essential to the proper consideration of the Bill now before the House, that the sacrifices our forefathers thought it necessary to make for the safeguarding of their country a century ago should be clearly understood.<lb/>
On May 25, 1809, the number of armed men in Great Britain and Ireland was as follows:&#x2014;Great Britain.&#x2014;Regulars, 91,999; Militia, 65,524; local Militia, 198,534; Volunteers, 114,066; Artillery and Engineers, 14,261; total, 484,384. Ireland.&#x2014;Regulars, 15,858; Volunteers, 75,340; total, 91,198; Grand total, 575,582. This year the numbers are:&#x2014;Regulars.&#x2014;England and Wales, 92,835; Scotland, 4,487; Ireland, 26,096; Channel Islands, 1,868; total, 125,286; Army Reserve, 134,000; Special Reserve, 67,780; Militia, 7,454; ditto Reserve, 1,704; ditto, Channel Isles, 2,984; Territorial Force, 240,000; total, 453,922. Grand total, 579,208. These figures show that the number of men under arms in the United Kingdom in 1809 was only 3,626 less than at the present time. And allow me to remind you, my Lords, that the danger against which we have to guard is infinitely greater now than it was a century ago. If any noble Lord distrusts this statement, I would ask him to carefully study the question for himself, and not merely pass my words by as the utterances of an early Victorian alarmist.<lb/>
<col>260</col>
The question at issue is a vital one, and far too serious to be passed over lightly. Our very existence may depend upon its being wisely dealt with. We have before us the fate of other nations&#x2014;commercial, maritime nations, flourishing and powerful like our own&#x2014;that fell because they trusted entirely to their fleets, as we are doing, and neglected their armies. When our forefathers were threatened with the danger of invasion, they realised the necessity for strengthening their land forces, and did not hesitate to resort to compulsion for this purpose. But there was then nothing like the preponderance in the strength of the several armies of Europe over our own Army that there is at present, and, moreover, the nations were busily engaged with their own troubles. To-day our Army is absolutely insignificant in numbers as compared with the armies of the first-class Continental Powers and we can only hope to have a very small portion of that Army&#x2014;the Regular portion&#x2014;trained as fully as are the armies of the Continent. And if this small, fully-trained portion has other work to do away from these shores&#x2014;as is almost certain to be the case&#x2014;we shall have to depend, as Mr. Haldane has frequently told us, on our citizen Army alone for the defence of this country. If, therefore, the citizen Army is required for this supreme duty, surely no doubt should be allowed to exist as to its fitness for that duty, no efforts should be neglected, and no sacrifices should be considered too great to ensure its being sufficient in numbers, and as efficient in the matter of training as it is possible to make it.<lb/>
I am well aware that the public generally have most unfortunately been led to believe that the Regular Army&#x2014;no matter how urgent the demand for its services may be elsewhere&#x2014;will not be sent out of this country until the Territorial Army has become sufficiently trained to be able of itself to defend these shores&#x2014;a period of six months after the outbreak of war being the minimum that Mr. Haldane calculates on as having at his disposal for this purpose&#x2014;and until the Navy has asserted itself sufficiently to ensure its supremacy at sea being undisputed. I cannot find words, my Lords, to express my amazement that such a policy should ever have been contemplated. I cannot believe that any one in the United Kingdom could be so absolutely lost to all sense of proper feeling as to consent to such an arrangement if it were really understood that it
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0134"/>
<col>261</col>
implies leaving India and the over-sea States to struggle unaided against possibly overwhelming numbers, and the possible sacrifice and abandonment of our country-men abroad, who are doing Great Britain's work under the shelter of Great Britain's flag. These men have entered upon their duties realising that they were running certain and often grave risks, but at the same time in the firm faith that, in the event of serious trouble arising, assistance would at once be sent to them from the Mother Country.<lb/>
Serious trouble has happened suddenly and unexpectedly in a distant part of our Empire, within the memory of many of us now alive. At that time, owing to the want of rapid communication, months elapsed before the much-needed help arrived, many valuable lives were lost, and a number of helpless women and children were ruthlessly massacred. Surely in these days of quick communication we are not going to allow such a deplorable catastrophe to happen again without straining every nerve to prevent it? Are we going to keep the Regular Army at home for our own protection&#x2014;the Army that is specially maintained for foreign service&#x2014;because, forsooth, we are so utterly selfish as to refuse to undergo the very slight sacrifice needed for the establishment of a citizen Army? I think better of my fellow countrymen than to believe they would be a party to what I can only describe as such a dastardly policy if they understood in the slightest degree to what it might lead. And I should hope, if after what I have said they are satisfied that we must look to the citizen and not to the Regular Army to defend their country, they will be ready to undergo that sacrifice by which alone a citizen Army can be rendered capable of performing its duty in a satisfactory manner.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, if the Regular Army is to carry out its legitimate duty, and cannot, therefore, be reckoned upon to assist in the defence of this country, it is upon the citizen Army that we must rely for that purpose. But it must be a real Army, the embodied strength of the trained manhood of our people. To rely upon such a force as that with which the present scheme supplies us is to lean upon a broken reed. Neither in numbers nor in training can the Territorial Army, under the haphazard conditions of voluntary service, reach the standard
<col>262</col>
which the safety of the country demands. As I explained when I had the honour of addressing this House last November, nothing short of a million of men will suffice for our needs; and even this large number would be of no practical use unless all ranks, especially the senior ranks, are adequately trained, and unless the citizen Army is provided with capable commanders and a thoroughly efficient staff. I use the word "adequately" advisedly, because I do not wish it to be supposed that I imagine, or that any member of the National Service League imagines, that citizen soldiers could be so perfectly trained as it is essential for Regular soldiers to be. It would, of course, place the defence question on a thoroughly satisfactory footing if we could maintain a Regular Army large enough both for home and over-sea purposes. But this is out of the question. Expense alone would prevent it, even if we could get&#x2014;which we cannot&#x2014;the required number of suitable men to enlist.<lb/>
What we have to make sure of, then, is that the citizen Army, by its larger numbers, by its greater intelligence, and by its adequate training, will be able to afford us the same security as a smaller and more perfectly trained Regular Army would give us. Larger numbers and greater intelligence are only possible under a system by which all able-bodied men, high and low, rich and poor, shall be made liable to serve in the citizen Army; and it is only by that Army being composed of such men that adequate, as opposed to perfect, training will suffice. And it is for these reasons that I and those who agree with me have brought before your Lordships' House the Bill, by which the required number of adequately trained men will be forthcoming. The Army that would be formed should this Bill become law would provide the solid filling in of the framework which Mr. Haldane has erected, and universal training would place the coping-stone on a well-designed structure. We do not claim for it that it would be a perfect Army&#x2014;that, as I have already stated, is impossible with a citizen Army&#x2014;but it would give us in the course of a few years a million of men adequately trained, well disciplined, and able to use their rifles with effect.<lb/>
My Lords, let me take the question of numbers first. We find that the number
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0135"/>
<col>263</col>
of lads reaching the age of eighteen in any one year in the United Kingdom is about 416,000. From this number we have made the following deductions:&#x2014;forty-eight per cent. for medical rejections and legal exemptions, 200,000; recruits for the Navy and Marines, 8,000; recruits for the Regular Army, 35,000; recruits for the mercantile marine, 15,000; emigrants, 10,000; a total of 268,000; leaving to be trained each year 148,000&#x2014;say, 150,000. I need not take up your Lordships' time by explaining the <i>data</i> on which these calculations are based, as they are given in the little pamphlet entitled "Estimate of the Numbers and Cost involved under the Scheme of Training Proposed by the National Service League," a copy of which has been furnished to each member of this House. Allowing five per cent. per annum for wastage, the numbers trained annually would be as follow:&#x2014;Recruits, 150,000; Territorial Army&#x2014;first year men 142,000, second year men 135,000, third year men 128,000, or 405,000. In addition to the above, who would be undergoing annual training, there would be nearly 900,000 men under thirty-one years of age who had passed through the ranks of the Territorial Army, but would be liable to be called up for home defence in case of grave national emergency. Briefly stated, under the proposals of the Bill we should have a Territorial Army some 80,000 in excess of the present establishment, and we should be able, with proper organisation, to mobilise the million armed and trained men necessary, in my opinion, to safeguard us from invasion.<lb/>
I now come to the no less important question of the amount of training necessary to secure what I have called "adequate" proficiency and discipline on the part of our citizen Army. Nothing has given rise to such differences of opinion as the duration of the first year's training&#x2014;some advocate a longer, some a shorter period. After very careful consideration, four months appears to be the most suitable period, having in view the industrial conditions of the country and the fact that this training should, as far as possible, be carried out in camp. We have therefore proposed this period for the Infantry, to which the larger majority of recruits will naturally be allotted. For the other arms, such as Cavalry and Artillery, we propose a longer period of recruit training, up to a limit of six months,
<col>264</col>
although I would point out that, under a national and compulsory system, recruits would not be posted to these arms unless they were particularly fitted to become efficient in them owing to their previous experience in civil life, such as being accustomed to the care of horses, and so on. I myself would never have agreed to so short a period of recruits' training as four months for the Infantry and six months for the other arms, with a fortnight's training in camp and a course of musketry annually during each of the next three years, if I had not calculated on the citizen Army including in its numbers the most intelligent and the best educated men in the land, instead of being composed of men of the class as that from which the Regular Army is, for the most part, drawn. And I now agree to this small amount of training only on the understanding that the training would be carried out by officers and noncommissioned officers of the Regular Army. and that for a time at any rate the citizen Army would be strengthened by a liberal number of Regular officers and noncommissioned officers being attached to it.<lb/>
I was greatly influenced in coming to a decision on this most essential point by my recollection of the soldierly manner in which the City Imperial Volunteers did their work in South Africa, but only after they had been given an adequate amount of training. The corps consisted of a field battery, a machine gun section, a battalion of infantry, and some mounted infantry composed of much the same stamp of men as would be found in nearly all corps if organised under an obligatory system of service. The total strength was 1,550 of all ranks, taken chiefly from Volunteer corps in and around London, and comprised men of all classes of society and of almost every profession and trade. Nine Regular officers served with the C.I.V. and&#x2014;what was a very important addition&#x2014;a second colour-sergeant of the Regular Army was attached to each company. Notwithstanding these great advantages, I think every one belonging to the corps will bear me out when I say that, on account of their want of practice and skill in shooting, and lack of training generally, the C.I.V. were not in a state to take the field when they first landed at Cape Town, even against an enemy so lightly trained as the Boers. Accordingly I arranged for the corps to be encamped on a suitable site on the Orange River, where it remained for more than a month drilling and
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0136"/>
<col>265</col>
practising shooting. There was nothing to distract the men's attention&#x2014;it was work, work, work, all day; and this continued, as far as was practicable, throughout the next two months while on the march towards Pretoria, with the result that when the C.I.V. were for the first time seriously engaged, all ranks acquitted themselves most creditably. But what I would ask you, my Lords, to remember is that their training was carried out in camp, under service conditions, and that when the corps met the enemy it had the great advantage of being brigaded with Regular troops, all of which were commanded by Regular officers experienced in war.<lb/>
I trouble your Lordships with these details in the hope that those of you who are not expert in military matters may realise the danger we are running by trusting the safety of this country to a force composed of inadequately trained men and commanded by inadequately trained officers. We know that our men, even the most illiterate of them, when well trained, well disciplined, and taught to shoot, make admirable soldiers; but it is a mystery to me why we should imagine that men inadequately trained as soldiers, simply because they happen to be our own countrymen, should be capable of coping successfully with the highly-trained soldiers of other nations. Our nation has no monopoly of patriotism, these highly-trained foreign soldiers are possessed of an equally patriotic spirit and are at least as well educated as our men. And, so far as my knowledge of history goes, no inadequately trained body of men have of late years been successful against a far smaller army of highly-trained soldiers. It is much to be regretted, therefore, that this truth is not plainly told to the men who have so loyally come forward to join the Territorial Army, instead of their being led to believe that the minimum amount of training which their civil duties admit of will fit them to meet on equal, or anything like equal, terms highly-trained soldiers.<lb/>
I now come to the cost of the scheme. As your Lordships are aware, from the pamphlet to which I have already alluded, the total cost estimated by the National Service League amounted to less than four millions over and above what the present Territorial Army is estimated to cost. The accuracy of these figures has been disputed by the War Office authorities, who, in a Paper published a few days ago, made out
<col>266</col>
that the scheme would come to close upon eight millions. I will not take up the time of this House by going at length into the two estimates; your Lordships have these, as well as the reply of the National Service League to the War Office, before you. You will be able to judge whether the original estimate of the National Service League is not practically correct, and certainly very much nearer the truth than the War Office estimate of eight millions, to say nothing of the wild statement made by Lord Crewe and Mr. Haldane last November that the cost would be twenty millions&#x2014;a statement which, as is now evident, was made without any attempt to understand our proposals. But, my Lords, even if the cost of the scheme were slightly more than four millions, we should have for this extra sum about 1,200 additional Regular officers and a large number of Regular non-commissioned officers, besides, as I have already shown, some 80,000 more men than Mr Haldane's scheme gives us, with a practically unlimited Reserve. The Territorial Army and the Reserve thus created would have adequate training before the outbreak of war; we should no longer be dependent on a force the serious training of which would be deferred till after the declaration of war. Surely the price we should pay would be a small one for national security.<lb/>
There are one or two other points regarding which a few words seem necessary, as misconception exists about them, and they have been made use of, to the prejudice of the Bill, by those who are opposed to universal military training. One is that the Territorial Army, as constituted by the Bill, is not really intended, as we say, for home defence only. Quite recently it was stated in one of our evening papers that&#x2014;
<quote>"such an army must be a conscript army on the European model, and those who demand it are clearly thinking not merely of defence, but of allied military operations abroad."</quote>
There is not the slightest foundation for that statement. The Territorial Army advocated by the Bill is meant for home defence and home defence alone. And no man belonging to that army will be under any obligation to serve abroad unless he volunteers to do so. At the same time, I wish to guard myself against misconception from an entirely different quarter. I have dwelt myself in this House upon the inadequacy of our over-sea forces.

<col>267</col>
and the Duke of Norfolk presided each laid great stress upon that inadequacy, and upon the need for far greater power of expansion than any we possess to-day.<lb/>
I fully realise the weight of this argument; and in reply to those who ask somewhat impatiently how an army intended purely, for Home defence can help to meet it, I would say first, that the citizen Army, which this Bill is meant to establish, would give absolute strategical freedom to our Navy and to our Regular Army, and so enormously enhance their striking power over-sea. Secondly, if once we create a great reservoir of trained manhood in this country, there is little doubt but that a goodly proportion of that reservoir would volunteer for service with our over-sea forces, and, as trained men, they would be capable of rendering valuable assistance to the Regulars. The experience of the South African war proved that, of the Yeomanry and Volunteers, one man in fifteen volunteered for the front; of the Militia, whose training and embodiment much more nearly resembled that of the proposed citizen Army, one man in five went to the front; but of the mass of our countrymen the proportion of volunteers was only one man in 1,000! This plainly shows that men who have gained some knowledge of soldiering and some confidence in themselves may be counted on to come forward in time of need to a much greater extent than citizens who have no such knowledge and confidence. The essential point on which I wish to insist is that while universal training for home defence imposes no obligation of over-sea service on any citizen, yet under that system, and under that system alone, can we furnish our limited Regular Army with the power of expansion.<lb/>
In support of this view, and in reply to Mr. Haldane's argument that universal training would interfere with recruiting for the Regular Army, let me give a few instances where military training has had the opposite effect, and I trust I shall be able to satisfy you that there never was a more mistaken idea. Amongst the boys brought up in the Duke of York's Military School at Chelsea eighty-five per cent. on an average join the Army annually. With scarcely an exception they do well, most of them becoming non-commissioned and warrant officers. It is much the same with the Royal Hibernian Military School in
<col>268</col>
Dublin; eighty per cent. of those boys join the Army and do remarkably well. In fact, the picked boys of both schools, with rare exceptions, enter the Army, while those who are less strong physically elect for civil life. From the Gordon Boys' Home also a considerable number enter both the Navy and the Army. Then we have the example of the <i>Spectator's</i> Experimental Company, which attracted much attention three years ago. Of the hundred men drilled at Hounslow for six months thirty-three joined the Army, and I have seen letters written to their Commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Pollock, in which they express themselves as most grateful for the benefit they derived from the training they were given. But by far the most convincing proof that military training aids, rather than obstructs, recruiting is given in Mr. John Fortescue's book to which I have already alluded. You will find in Appendix I of the report that during the years 1805 and 1813 inclusive a larger number of men volunteered from the Militia&#x2014;a service which at that time was compulsory&#x2014;to the Regular Army than that Army obtained by the ordinary recruiting means.<lb/>
There is one other thing I desire to impress upon your Lordships, and that is that we can never hope to have either a citizen Army such as is needed for the defence of this country, or an effective force to protect Imperial interests overseas, unless we become&#x2014;what Mr. Haldane has so often held up to us as his ideal&#x2014;"A nation in arms!" In no other way can every man, woman, and child be led to take a friendly and an intelligent interest in the Army, or become imbued with that feeling of patriotism and willingness to submit to a certain amount of self-sacrifice which is absolutely essential if the Army is to be a success. Every man should esteem it an honour to help in the defence of his country; every woman should feel that the children given to her are at the disposal of her country; and every boy, as part of his education, should be physically and militarily drilled, and be taught patriotism, to honour the King and the flag, and to use his rifle skilfully.<lb/>
In conclusion, I feel it is due to this House and myself to explain the reason for my pointing out so persistently what I consider to be the unsatisfactory condition of our Home Defence Army. The fact is, I
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0138"/>
<col>269</col>
realised some time ago that the lessons of the war were being completely forgotten, and that the unanimously expressed opinion of the two Royal Commissions as to the necessity for some radical change in our military organisation was being ignored. I felt strongly that this attitude could not be allowed to continue without the safety of the country being seriously endangered. And it filled me with despair to find that the leaders of both parties in the State, though recognising the danger, were so firmly convinced that the country would not consent to adopt universal military training for home defence that they decided that we must still adhere to the voluntary system, and entrust the safety of the country to the limited number of men who might be forthcoming, with the inadequate training that could be given to them under such a system.<lb/>
I honestly believe that all that it is possible to do has been done during the last few years to make the Home Army efficient under the voluntary system. I recognise the many good points of Mr. Haldane's scheme; and the thoroughness and loyalty with which it has been supported by civilians and by all soldiers are beyond praise. I should deeply regret if, from anything I have said to-day, or on any former occasion, I appear in the slightest degree unappreciative of, or ungrateful for, the great effort that has been made and the really good work that has been performed. But, feeling as strongly as I do that no voluntary system, however good, can ever give us what we want, I should be failing in my duty to my King and to my country were I to hold my peace. The voluntary system has been tried for fifty years, and although no doubt the Territorial Army is a grand organisation and in every way better than was the Volunteer Force; it can never provide the required number of efficiently trained men to insure our safety from invasion, or give us the means of expansion in time of war without the introduction of universal training. I cannot for one moment believe that our countrymen would hesitate to accept universal training, were the necessity for the measure put plainly before them by the leaders of both Parties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00675">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014; (<i>Earl Roberts</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00676"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and gallant Earl has put before
<col>270</col>
us in clear language the motives which have impelled him to bring in this Bill, and the effect which he believes it will have in insuring the defence of the country. The Bill has in it many details, but they are details of enormous importance, and when the Bill reaches the Committee stage those questions will call for very earnest and mature consideration. There is the great underlying question of expense. The expense may be found so great that some modifications of the scheme may be called for. There is also the question whether the amount of training suggested by the Bill is likely to be adequate or whether a longer period of training may not be necessary. These are all questions of immense importance, and should the Bill reach Committee they would have to be considered. But I venture to believe that the real thought in the mind of every member of this House to-night is not so much the effect of those questions as the great fact that this Bill does, for the first time, distinctly propose to bring in, by Act of Parliament, compulsory service for home defence. To a certain extent the old Militia Act had that object, but this is in a different way; and what we have to consider to-night is to what extent this House should support that proposal or whether it should reject it as one which ought not to be entertained.<lb/>
The noble and gallant Earl paid a tribute to the patriotism of those who had joined the Territorial Army. I am sure that there is no notion on the part of those who believe compulsion to be necessary of slurring the patriotism of our fellow-countrymen. To form this Territorial Army we have seen some 240,000 men come forward voluntarily to serve their King and country. Is there any other nation in the world that can say the same? We know, proudly, that that is a fact which every nation must see and appreciate; but, at the same time, if, in spite of that patriotic feeling, the proper numbers are not reached, it may be that the nearer success is achieved the greater may be the danger lurking behind that movement because the full success is not attained. But it is not only that patriotic men do come forward. I believe everyone would admit that were compulsion resorted to a great many men, who would be only too glad to come forward voluntarily now, would welcome the opportunity of coming forward then, because compulsion would remove from them great
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0139"/>
<col>271</col>
difficulties which impede their following their patriotic impulses at the present moment.<lb/>
I had the honour to preside over a Commission which reported some five years ago on the question of what was then called the Volunteers, and witness after witness came before us, not to urge that compulsion was an obnoxious thing, but, on the contrary, to aver that they would very gladly come forward to serve their country and would very willingly release from their duties those who were employed by them if only compulsion were resorted to, because then a particular employer would not be made a scapegoat for his patriotism but others would have to do the same. They impressed upon the Commission the obvious reality of the dangers and difficulties to professional men if they came forward to serve their country while other men lurked behind. The present system undoubtedly creates great patriotism, but it inflicts a penalty on those who come forward to serve. It puts them in a position of jeopardy with regard to their livelihood and their profession, and it leaves those who skulk behind to reap the advantages of the patriotism of others. Moreover, it shuts out from the service of their country many who are full of patriotism but are still unable, for the sake of their wives and families, to face the ordeal which must confront them if they come forward and leave others to cut them out in their business. By this Bill we are not whipping men to the front because enough do not come forward; we are encouraging and helping vast numbers of patriotic men to discharge a duty they are only too eager to discharge.<lb/>
Then we are told that this may be all very well as regards certain individuals, but that the people of this country are not ready for this change. Well, my Lords, is it the part of the House to lag behind the nation? Is it not our business to lead the country, to try and educate public opinion on this great and vital question? We all know that the members of the other House of Parliament&#x2014;it is only natural&#x2014;must be perpetually feeling the pulse of public opinion. It is difficult for them to go forward and shock the minds of their constituents. It is part of the business of that branch of the Legislature to keep in touch with public opinion, and to express the feelings which are dominant at the
<col>272</col>
moment. But the House of Lords is in a totally different position, and if we are perpetually looking to see what this man or that man says, if we are here only to register the popular voice, if we are never to lead and take a part in questions because they may be unpopular, I venture to say we are betraying the very reason for which the Constitution calls upon us to exist. I do submit that this is just one of the questions in which we ought to take the lead.<lb/>
Neither the noble and gallant Earl himself nor any of his closest supporters cherish the least belief that this Bill can become law. The state of business in another place is such that there is not the remotest chance of its becoming an Act this session, and I venture to say that this is not one of those moments of extreme crisis in which there is anything disloyal or unpatriotic in not seeing eye to eye with the Government of the day. Of course, if there were any great crisis at hand, if the foe were actually knocking at our doors, we should all unite in determined support of the Government, and do nothing which would possibly embarrass it in any way. But I venture to suggest that what we are trying to do now is to promote something which will amplify, and, in our belief, carry to success, the very determined and bold efforts which the Minister for War has made to promote a Territorial Army to defend our shores. Those of us who have the honour of being Lords-Lieutenant of the King have during the last month been doing our utmost in the counties committed to our charge to represent the needs of the Territorial Army, to represent the importance of it, and we have frequently used the argument that if the number of men cannot be found by voluntary service, then we must face the fact that the United Kingdom will be obliged to fall back on compulsory service; and it seems to me that if this House to-night throws back a measure of this kind, it will stultify what we have been saying, and lead people to believe that we have been trying to snare them into the Territorial Army by arguments in which we really did not believe and by theories which did not hold water.<lb/>
The noble Duke, I understand, is going to ask us to pledge ourselves to a loving trust in the military advisers of the Crown. As far as trying to make a success of the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0140"/>
<col>273</col>
scheme now before us is concerned, we have all, as I have said, been doing our utmost to that end. As Chairman of the Commission to which I have alluded, I ought first to express my deep sense of the way in which one part of the recommendations of that Commission has been met, and of the way in which the then disjointed organisation of the Volunteers has now been formed into the nucleus of a real army. But what this Bill suggests is what I believe many of us feel convinced to be necessary in order to make the Territorial Army really effective and to carry it to a successful issue as the outcome of Mr. Haldane's really gigantic labours. So far I entirely agree with the noble Duke that we should do our utmost to support the military advisers of the Crown. But, my Lords, if it means that we are really to endorse all their policy and all the views they express, I am bound to say that that is a very difficult thing to do.<lb/>
I will only take one point, not to weary the House. Your Lordships know that the Bill enacts that the men who come into the Territorial Force are to go through four months training. The Government cap that, because I understand the Government theory is that they are to do six months training. But whereas the Bill enacts that every man who joins the Force is to carry out that four months training at the commencement of his military career thereby putting him on a firm foundation and enabling later training for shorter periods to bear fruit, the Government make their six months training begin when the invasion is immediately threatened. I earnestly hope that no foreign country has it in contemplation to invade our shores; but in these days of strife and warfare it is probable that many countries have considered what they would do if they were obliged to invade England, and probably have definite schemes prepared in their War Offices or in their Admiralties with that object in view. I do not know, but I should very much doubt if in those schemes there was a clause that six months notice of the invasion should be given. If in none of those schemes that provision appears, and if that period of six months does exist in our scheme of defence, is it not almost&#x2014;I do not know what language to use consistent with the dignity of your Lordships' House&#x2014;but is it conceivable that we really could honestly work on in the belief that such a system as
<col>274</col>
that could possibly have any but one result?<lb/>
Let me allude again to the Commission. It is only fair, in a debate of this kind, that I should bear witness to the untiring energy of the members of that Commission and the patient manner in which they entered into the subject. The Commission consisted of Peers, of members of the other House of Parliament, of professional men, of soldiers, and of civilians. It was clear from the beginning that we approached the questions that were before us from many different points of view. Our discussions were protracted and there was considerable divergence of opinion on many points, but there was not one member of that Commission who, having devoted, I think it was, twelve months to the problem before us, was able to leave the room without reporting to his Sovereign and warning his fellow-countrymen that we could not see any means of securing this country against invasion if the voluntary system only were resorted to. It is fact that when that question did come before us there was not one member of the Commission who, considering the matter with a deep sense of his responsibility, could come to any other decision, and I think your Lordships' House ought to bear a fact of that kind in mind.<lb/>
We are not passing into law any Statute to-night. This is, perhaps, to a certain extent an academical debate; but we have to consider, Is the country in that state in which it is wise that we should support those who would lull it into a sense of false security? If we do overshoot the mark it will do no harm; but I think we ought to shake the nation up and make it believe that, in the opinion of this House, at all events, this great question of compulsory service is one that ought to be faced, even if not eventually carried into law. It will be a harmful thing indeed if those who are only too anxious to be apathetic, who will not recognise the fact that there are great perils existing and that great efforts must be made to face them, are told that the House of Lords has thrown this proposal back. Of course, I do not expect those in the responsible position of Ministers of the Crown to at once take up a question of this kind, and I am not surprised that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is unable to see his way to support the Bill. He is in a position of great respon-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0141"/>
<col>275</col>
sibility. It is not a question of passing the Bill into law, and he may feel that to pledge himself before the absolute moment of necessity comes would be an uncalled-for act on his part.<lb/>
But I cannot help expressing may great surprise and regret that this has been made somewhat of a Party question to-night. I cannot conceive why your Lordships cannot be entrusted to express your own opinion on a matter of this kind. It very greatly takes away the effect of the vote we shall come to, because, instead of being an independent vote on the part of the members of your Lordships' House, it will mean that the Party system has been invoked and Party pressure brought to bear. Therefore the country will not know what is the view of the House of Lords. I think it is unfortunate that that has been done. At the same time I hope your Lordships will feel that the matter is of such importance that we must consider the merits of the question each one for himself. As I say, I think it is to this House that the country may look for an example and for encouragement in this matter. We know the causes which have helped to bring about the success of the Territorial Army so far as that success has been achieved. All honour to those who have felt bound, at a critical time, to do their utmost; but no one will say that these methods have been always of a dignified kind. They are not the methods on which it is desirable that the Force which should defend England should exist, and, moreover, they are methods which will have very soon become worn out and will fail as a stimulant to recruiting and the upkeep of the Force.<lb/>
It does seem to me that this House ought to take care, now the question is before us, that it is not rejected, and spurned and cast back, but that it is at all events put on a footing which brings it into practical politics and makes the people of the country understand that it is one which must be considered and faced. It is no use saying that Members of this House may fold their hands and do nothing, but that if the enemy does come to the gate the somewhat hysterical enthusiasm of the Music-hall will arouse the latent patriotism of England. It will be too late then for that course to be adopted, and it will not be a worthy course if it has to be resorted to. I do earnestly hope that
<col>276</col>
your Lordships will feel that what we have to do to-night is to record the fact that, in the opinion of this House, this measure represents the carrying forward of a great question which must some day be faced and which may be faced too late. I trust the day will never come when the cry, "Too late, too late," shall be heard throughout England. This House is in an independent position and a position of great responsibility, and I believe it will seldom have done anything more worthy of its great history than if it does cause the people of England to realise that this is a question which cannot be laid aside but must be patriotically grappled with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00677"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> had given notice, on the Motion. for the Second Reading, to move the following Resolution, viz.: "That this House fully recognises the need of a Home Army amply sufficient to secure the country against all risk from invasion, and the advantage of giving to as large a part of the population as possible a sound groundwork of military training, but it is not prepared to proceed further with a measure which, while involving unknown demands upon the national resources, Would supersede the system accepted as sufficient by the military advisers of His Majesty's Government."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00678">The noble Duke said: My Lords, I think I need not assure your Lordships that I fully realise the seriousness of opposing anything of this kind which is advocated by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. There is no one better qualified, by his vast and varied experience, by his great professional talents, by his distinguished services, by the respect universally entertained for his personal conduct and his devotion to public service, than the noble and gallant Earl to deal with a subject of this kind. I also regret to put myself in opposition to the noble Duke who sits on my left, because he has seen service and I have not. He has had the honour, as he has said, of presiding over an important Commission, and he has therefore had ample opportunities, which I have not enjoyed, of forming a judgment. And, my Lords, if I thought that this was merely a military question, I certainly should not have ventured to put down the Motion of which I have given notice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00679">But what strikes me as so curious about this question is the fact that the advocates
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0142"/>
<col>277</col>
of it seem to be unaware that it has a totally different aspect altogether from the military aspect, that it means a most momentous and far-reaching change. I will try and prove my words. I am simply stating a case, in the first instance, that I will presently endeavour to prove. As I say, it is a very momentous and far-reaching change, striking deep into the foundations of society, and affecting the whole character of the nation. I am disposed to dwell and insist on this all the more because I observe that the advocates of universal service appear, certainly from their omissions in never alluding to the subject, to ignore it altogether. Now it is a very remarkable thing that both the noble and gallant Field-Marshal and the noble Duke to-night have evidently a sort of uneasy feeling that the country as a whole is not in favour of universal service. They have alluded to that as one of the difficulties they admit the Government may have to face. It is perfectly true, as has been said, that there are many who would willingly serve their country who are debarred by various influences, and that those influences would be removed if universal service were carried out. That very argument seems to me to be one which is employed by those who feel that there is a great deal to be said on the other side.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00680">Now, is it not worth while, if there is this doubt about the feeling of the United Kingdom with regard to universal service, to find out whether there is any ground for it or not? I beg leave to says at once that I am not here now to deny for one moment that it is the duty of every man, in case of necessity, to defend his country. I am not here to deny that if the necessity exists, if the safety of this country is absolutely dependent upon universal service, universal service must be carried out at whatever cost. I make the noble and gallant Field-Marshal a present of that admission. I will say presently why I do not think it covers all the ground or is a conclusive argument, but I admit it. That is one of the arguments which my noble friends use generally in favour of universal service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00681">Then there is another argument. They say, Do you not think that drill and training are admirable educational processes? I quite agree. I do most heartily wish that the National Service League when inaugurated had confined them-
<col>278</col>
selves to insisting upon drilling every boy and every girl in every school in England. I believe it would have been a capital thing. I should have put it upon the ground of physique. We are told that the physique of our race is deteriorating. Whether that is true, or whether it is not true, it would have been a capital peg to hang universal training upon, and I fully believe what the noble and gallant Earl pointed out, that this sort of drill and training does induce boys when they come to the proper age to enlist in the Regular Army. I was very much struck with what the noble and gallant Earl said about the Duke of York's School and other schools. It is perfectly true, and I have always regretted that that which I believe the vast majority of the people of this country would have agreed to, and which, at any rate, would have been the thin end of the wedge, the National Service League never would entertain, and never would go in for. I remember we had a meeting in my county at the time, and I put this before them. They asked us to form a branch, and we said, "We will form a branch if you will confine yourselves to the drilling and the training of children in the schools." No, they would have universal service, and the consequence is they have not made, I think, as much way as they would otherwise have done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00682">Now, my Lords, if I am to show, even very faintly, because it is a very difficult thing to show in its full and lurid colours, what is the effect of universal service, I must take it as it will be when it is carried out fully. It is perfectly true that this Bill asks for a minimum of universal service, and it may be fairly argued that, although the medicine is a very disagreeable one, the pill is so small that we need not make faces over it. But if you want to understand the nature of the medicine, you must study it when it is given in larger doses. I will presently, if your Lordships will allow me, explain why I think the doses will not remain so small if you pass this Bill as it is now suggested. Now, what will be the educational effect of taking boys of eighteen and nineteen, of twenty and twenty-one, and herding them together in one general hotchpot? What is it that guardians and parents of all classes wish for their children when they grow up? Broadly speaking, may it not be put thus: That a young man should imbibe the highest ideals, the best tone and conduct
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0143"/>
<col>279</col>
and manners of the class to which he belongs?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00683">Well, my Lords, is that end to be attained if, at the command of a bureau which has no soul to be saved and no body to be kicked, and so far as I know no aptitude for the training of youth, and without regard to the wishes of the parents, boys of all characters and classes are thrown together&#x2014;at an age when passion is strongest, and experience, judgment, and principle are weakest, an imitative age when lasting impressions are easily made&#x2014;in the close and uninterrupted intercourse of barrack room, barrack square, and canteen. What is to be the result? Did not your Lordships, with sons to look after about eighteen or nineteen or twenty years of age, devote attention to what they were going to do, to which was the best University to send them, or which was the best college to put their names down for? And if you decided that the Army would be a good thing to put them to, did you not consider what kind of regiment they should join and what the character of the regiment was before you put them into it? I think I have heard of such a thing. And yet we are told that we are to take the whole of that responsibility out of the hands of parents and put it into the hands, as I said before, of an irresponsible authority to carry out. I do not believe, speaking of the masses of the youth generally, that they can emerge from such an ordeal as that without being somewhat the worse for it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00684">What is the experience of the French? I have been told something about it, and I only give it for what it is worth. Perhaps some of your Lordships have more knowledge of the matter than I have, but I have been told that it is notorious that when a young Frenchman is posted to a regiment far from his own home, as often happens, he is lost, as it were, in the crowd, the consequence being that the years which he spends in the army are years in which all restraint is removed and evils are done which very likely affect the character for life.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00685">It is a curious thing, but no system, as far as I can remember, of universal service has ever been inaugurated without resort having to be had to exemptions, which in themselves are an admission that the hardship is intolerable to certain individuals. In some countries you have a very complex system of exemptions. The noble and gal
<col>280</col>
lant Earl's Bill has a very simple list of exemptions. There is, in fact, in the Bill only one exemption, which I may call an exemption for philanthropic reasons, and that is the only son of a widow who is wholly or partially maintained by that son. The widow with an only son is a very picturesque character, and a character which appeals to us all. We sympathise very much with her. But putting sympathy aside, supposing the mother in question be not a widow but a woman with a crippled husband who cannot work. There are then two mouths to feed instead of one. That couple may be wholly or partially maintained by an only son. I really do not see that her case is very much better, and why that only son should not be exempt also. Nor do I think the same argument is difficult in the case of a large family of orphans without father and mother, but with one or, perhaps, two elder brothers just managing to keep them out of the workhouse. I do not happen to know why that is not a case equally as pitiable as the other, and yet it is proposed to take those two elder brothers away, the consequence undoubtedly being that all those orphan children would be forced to the workhouse. I could take any number of illustrations. No system of exemptions could get over the difficulties of meeting all the varying circumstances of life.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00686">There are two reasons at least why universal service must always be unpopular. First of all, because it takes all control away from the parents; and, secondly, because it inflicts hardships which are almost intolerable under certain circumstances. You are proposing to exchange this system for a system which at least has the one merit that it is voluntary, and the further merit that you know that every man you have got hold of has come more or less because he likes it. I think this means a very serious change, and I again repeat that I am a good deal surprised that those who advocate it&#x2014;I quite understand their saying the objection is not a sufficient one&#x2014;have never called attention to that fact, and have expressed a sort of wonder that the nation is not very anxious to fall in with their scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00687">Now, my Lords, I will put another case. The noble Earl has appended a Memorandum to the beginning of this Bill. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"The Bill secures absolute equality of treatment as between all classes."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0144"/>
<col>281</col>
I think we know what is meant. He means all classes in the social circles. But how about other classes. There are some very curious exemptions here, or rather peculiar provisions with regard to exemptions. One is exempted who is able to certify to the Army Council in prescribed manner that by reason of physical or mental infirmity he is permanently unfitted for training, but that man is to be fined. I should have thought that that was something very like paying for exemption. The only difference is that exemption has to be given, not because the man is unwilling, but because he is incapable of serving. Presumably this man, because he is an infirm man, has a difficulty in earning his livelihood; yet you fine him if he happens to be earning a little more than what is only an ordinary labourer's wage. It goes further than that. The extreme seems to me to be fully as absurd. You have an able-bodied man who has varicose veins, or who has lost a good many of his teeth, or who has only one eye, or some defect of that sort, but a man who is perfectly willing, and, perhaps, very anxious to serve in the Army; but you will not let him, and then you fine him because you cannot accept him. It does seem to me a most extraordinary proposition, and though the fine may not be a heavy one, it seems such an intolerable injustice that I confess I do not wonder that people should fear universal service and think it undesirable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00688">Then there is a very curious proviso that all these cripples and ministers of religion and policemen are to be liable to go to the front in case of emergency, although they are not to be liable to undergo training. What earthly good they are going to do at the front except to be food for powder and shot, I cannot imagine. But there is one man who is absolutely and always exempt&#x2014;that is the criminal. If a man is a criminal then he may stay at home and smoke his pipe. All the police have been removed in order to go to the front, so he can make himself perfectly happy at home, and if he chooses to ply his trade he can do so comfortably. I can remember the time when criminals were made to enlist in the Army, and although perhaps not desirable acquaintances, yet they made excellent soldiers and fought exceedingly well, and I should have thought that the very first person to force to the front would be the criminal, and that you would leave the policeman at home.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00689">It has been said that though there has been talk of a great many evils, after all this only means four or five months training. Last week we had a very interesting incident in this House. The noble Earl the late Under-Secretary of State for War came down to the House and denounced a Bill of which he had been the main supporter and defender during its passage through this House. I do not remember ever having witnessed a similar incident. I have known a great many politicians voting against Bills which their own side had brought in, but it has generally been either because they knew their own Department was going to bring in a Bill with which they could better agree, or for some other very good reason. But after defending every line of the Bill with very great patience and good humour through some very interesting debates, the noble Earl came down to this House and denounced that Bill in most emphatic terms; and more curious still, my noble friends here cheered him, and the noble Lord, Lord Newton, got up and defended him. What was the charge the noble Earl made against his Majesty's Government? It was that the territorial scheme would not provide a force which would liberate the Regular Army, so that you might strike at the commencement of a great war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00690">If he will allow me, I will put to the noble and gallant Field-Marshal one plain question. Does he think that the Army which is to be formed under this Bill, after four or five months training and with two or three weeks drill for three years following, will be ready at the commencement of any war to resist an invasion? If he does think so, why do noble Lords on each side of the House complain of the short time which the present Government has in which to train its Territorial Force? Is it not evident that if you pass this Bill those noble Lords will insist upon lengthening the term of service? My noble friend's Commission recommended a year's service and condemned the Swiss system because, good though it was in many respects, it was impossible to train an army in so short a time. You may be certain of this, after what happened last week, that as sure as you pass a Bill of this kind you will have pressure put upon you to extend the length of service; and if you want an army which is to defend these shores at the commencement of a great war without any support from the Regular troops, it would be perfectly ridiculous, in my opinion, to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0145"/>
<col>283</col>
trust to an army which only had the training which this Bill proposes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00691">Now, my Lords, I turn for a moment to the question of cost. There is a beautiful vagueness about the question of cost. Cost, no doubt, is not the most important point from one aspect of the question, because it does not matter what we pay for the defence of these shores. Whatever is necessary we must pay. But we should like to have some little estimate of what the bill is likely to be. It varies at the present moment from &#x00A3;20,000,000 to &#x00A3;4,000,000. The noble Earl opposite, the Leader of the House, himself mentioned the figure of &#x00A3;20,000,000, and he is now being told that he did not know what he was talking about. The noble Earl is a responsible spokesman for the Government, and therefore I think I am justified in saying that the estimate has varied from &#x00A3;20,000,000 to &#x00A3;4,000,000. The other day the Government issued a Paper which reduced it to &#x00A3;8,000,000, and I see that there is an answer which has come out to-day from the National Service League reducing it to &#x00A3;4,500,000. This is not a very satisfactory state of things, but what I should like to point out to your Lordships is that the expense which these noble Lords are talking about is only a very small part of the expense which the country will be called upon to bear under this scheme. Will you allow me to call attention to Clause 8, which confers power to make Orders and Regulations for&#x2014;
<quote>"the preparation and keeping of lists and registers of persons who are or will within six months become liable to serve by virtue of this Act and the obtaining of returns or particulars from or as to any such persons."</quote>
Then as to&#x2014;
<quote>"the attendance for enrolment of persons liable to serve by virtue of this Act."</quote>
Then again&#x2014;
<quote>"the notification to persons liable to serve by virtue of this Act of their liabilities under this Act."</quote>
and&#x2014;
<quote>"the assignment to county associations of any powers and duties in connection with the carrying of this Act into effect;"</quote>
and, finally, in the Schedule there is an exemption for any person who can satisfy the Army Council that he is the only son of a widow, and another for a person who can satisfy the Army Council that he is physically or mentally unfit. How is all this going to
<col>284</col>
be done&#x2014;by the local authorities, or the territorial associations, or the county councils? I should like to warn your Lordships that you are exacting too much of local authorities already, and you will not find voluntary labour given to an unlimited extent. There will have to be some payment for it, and ultimately you will have to pay county councils and these county associations if you put so much work upon them. But, even as these authorities are now, you know perfectly well that you cannot get all these things done without putting large charges on the rates, and increasing the burdens of the country both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00692">I have endeavoured to show that universal service must necessarily have a far-reaching effect on the character of the nation, and that it is a system which bears with cruel inequality on those who are the subjects of it. But I have left out something. Did the noble Earl ever think of the conscientious objector? If there is one man whom Governments always quail before it is the conscientious objector, no matter what Government it may be that is in office. What are you going to do with the conscientious objector? There are the people called Quakers. What is going to become of them? Do you think they will feel no hardship in being compelled to serve in the Army, and yet are you going to exempt them? I hardly like to remind the noble Duke that there are some monastic institutions in this country. Are their members to be compelled to serve, or are they going to be classed as ministers of some denomination? These questions have never been thought out or even touched upon by noble Lords who have spoken in favour of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00693">In my opinion, if this system is to be adopted it should be recommended by the military advisers of some responsible Government, and the Government of the country should take it in hand. It has been said that this Motion of mine is nothing less than a vote of confidence in Mr. Haldane and his military advisers. I do not want to say anything discourteous, or I should say that such a statement is absolutely absurd. I do not believe in Mr. Haldane or in any of his works. But I know this, that whether you believed in it or not, you passed the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act and you are responsible, not for the system, but for giving the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0146"/>
<col>285</col>
system a trial. If you were not prepared to give the system a trial, you should have thrown that Bill out. Although I am, I confess, a most profound disbeliever in the system, I do contend that the Government have a right to say, "Give us a fair trial." Having made that statement I do protest most strongly against anybody asserting that I am moving a vote of confidence in the Government, which is the very last thing in the world I should dream of doing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00694">The noble Duke on my left said that this had been made a Party question. I think I have been sufficiently long in this House for your Lordships to recognise that I am not a too loyal member of my Party. I do not think that I have the credit of always voting with my Party, but I do say this, that it is a little hard to attack the responsible members of any Party, whether in the Government or the Opposition, because they decline to be committed to a system which is not recommended by the military advisers of the Crown, and which has never been sanctioned by any Government, and, further, with regard to which the feeling of the country has never been expressed. It is a little bit hard to blame them because they use every endeavour to prevent this House committing itself to a course which, once adopted, it cannot retreat from.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00695">My Lords, I am very much obliged to you for the attention you have given me. I feel the full responsibility of this Motion. I feel how weightily this measure comes before you, proposed, as it is, by a General of such eminence as the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, but this much I hope I have proved, that the advocates of this system should at least show that they know and that they realise what the disadvantages are. They ought to realise, as I said at the commencement of my speech, how deep down they are going into the character of the whole of the population, and they should endeavour, if possible, to remove the objections and allay the fears of those who, like myself, think it would be a very perilous experiment. I say again, if the safety of this country really depended upon it, and if any Government came forward and said on their own responsibility that this country was not safe without it, then if the evils I see in it were tenfold I would vote for it. But until that day comes, my Lords, I think we had better hold our hands. It is for that reason I have
<col>286</col>
ventured to put this Amendment upon the Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00696">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out all the words after 'That' for the purpose of inserting the following Resolution, viz.: 'This House fully recognises the need of a Home Army amply sufficient to secure the country against all risk from invasion, and the advantage of giving to as large a part of the population as possible a sound groundwork of military training, but it is not prepared to proceed further with a measure which, while involving unknown demands upon the national resources, would supersede the system accepted as sufficient by the military advisers of His Majesty's Government.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Duke of Northumberland</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00697"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel so very strongly, in the face of such considerations as have been brought before us in the speech of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, how difficult our course is; and knowing how many of your Lordships must already have formed a conclusion upon this subject, I rise with great diffidence and great hesitation to place any opinion before you. I cannot but feel that the fact that compulsory service has been to those who have served at the War Office a constant thought and has been dangled before our eyes for years past as an easy and practical means of emerging from the morass of difficulties in which we find ourselves with regard to military organisation, furnishes a special reason why those who, like my noble friend Lord Lansdowne and myself, have had the charge of the Army, should not withhold from your Lordships to-night the considerations which guide us in coming to a conclusion upon an issue which I venture to say is a grave and far-reaching one, and involves dangers which have been but little appreciated.<lb/>
I think I shall best be consulting the wishes of all those who heard the speech of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal if I do not attempt to dissect in detail the Bill which he has moved to-night. I believe what we are occupied upon is a consideration of the principle, and in considering that principle I think we may do a good deal by clearing away in the first instance those points which are points of common agreement. I take it that we are all agreed that the organisation of our Army must be such that we can afford to send 150,000 Regular troops abroad, and yet defend this country after that army has departed. That was the underlying note of the noble Earl's speech. That also
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0147"/>
<col>287</col>
was the view of the last Government, and that view I take to be held in its entirety by the present Government. The noble Earl has pressed upon us most strongly that there is a serious danger of invasion. That is his case, and I understood that it was the case of the noble Earl opposite, and that he accepted on behalf of the Government that there was a very serious danger of invasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00698"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: No, I am afraid that is not accurate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00699"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: The words are not immediately before me, but they were most clear and definite. The noble Earl said he was not one of those who held the dinghy theory. He said there was a fear of invasion against which such reasonable precautions as can be taken in all human affairs must be taken. He did not tie himself as to the extent of the danger, but surely he cannot contend to your Lordships that he did not admit there was a danger and at the same time that proper precautions should be taken against it. I think we must claim that the noble Earl admits that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00700"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Viscount will allow me to deal with the matter at greater length in the course of the debate than I can do at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00701"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I will not press the noble Earl further, but it is a vital point that the Government admitted the danger of invasion, and therefore insisted upon a home Army with which to meet invaders. If I am not correct we are in absolute disagreement with them on the main point on which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal's Bill is poised to-night. The third point on which I understand there is common agreement is that we must have a field Army, and that Army must be amply sufficient, in the words of the noble Duke who has just spoken, to secure the country at all times from the risk of invasion. That is where the difference of opinion comes in. We have heard to-night how insufficient the noble and gallant Field-Marshal considers our present forces to be. On the other hand, only five days ago we heard from the Under-Secretary of State for War what I understand to be the military opinion with regard to those forces. In reply to the noble Earl opposite, Lord Portsmouth, he said that if the noble Earl
<col>288</col>
asked whether the Territorial Forces ever could be capable of meeting an invasion the answer would be, Yes. The noble Earl pressed him whether that Force was capable at this moment to resist invasion, and the Under-Secretary said&#x2014;
<quote>"I answer unhesitatingly No; the Territorial Force is not at, present fit to meet anything like equally the most highly-trained Continental troops."</quote>
He added, that on the other hand, when the Territorial Force had had a period of proper training there was no doubt they would be as good as any other troops in the world for their purpose. That is the point at issue between the two contending parties to-night.<lb/>
I hesitate to get into that line of fire, but I should not be dealing frankly with your Lordships if I did not say that we hold a position somewhere between the two. We can follow the noble and gallant Earl in one thing unhesitatingly. If there is a doubt as to the safety of this country, we give our votes for keeping within the safety zone at all hazards. There are no men in this House who can compare with those who sit on this Bench in regard to feeling the necessity of being fully reinforced to the extent of safety. Those of us who went through what the noble Marquess behind me went through, in the winters of 1899 and 1900, with nearly all the available Artillery gone abroad, and all the Regular troops out of the country, and when we were in a state with regard to national defence which it is not indiscretion now to say was regarded by military authorities as highly dangerous, will never forget that time, and are not likely to vote against any measure, the loss of which would in any way place us in the same jeopardy again. I am quite sure the noble Marquess will never forget that time; and if I may speak for a year later, within a few days of my becoming responsible at the War Office, I remember well receiving repeated telegrams from Lord Kitchener asking me for fresh mounted reinforcements, without which he considered the war must drag on indefinitely. The opinion of my military advisers then was that no force short of 30,000 troops efficiently trained and mounted would be of any service. At that time I had not of trained men in the country above 3,000 to send out, and I had, after a vote of the Cabinet, to send the full number available, and to raise, organise,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0148"/>
<col>289</col>
and improvise the whole of the remainder, with not merely the difficulty of getting the men and of buying the horses, but even the difficulty of finding military saddles which would be useful and on which the men could sit when they had got them. I can truly say that I do not think that any man who has had any experience of the late war will, if he can help it, allow this country to be placed in such a position again.<lb/>
There is another point on which I should like to express our concurrence with the noble Earl. I do not labour it, because we have much to get through, but if the question is raised whether compulsory military service is a good thing in itself we believe, as the noble Duke who has just sat down believes, that it would be an advantage to, the nation that every boy who can be should be drilled. I am glad&#x2014;and in that I venture to differ from the noble Duke&#x2014;that the noble Earl did not stop short, if we are to have it at all, at military training, because, good as military training may be for the individual, it is only by organised military service that you can produce a result which will give us safety if we are not safe at present. Again, I believe that the spirit of discipline is an advantage in an age which is neither too serious nor too earnest. I would say myself that my whole instinct is in favour of military service, and any whole desire is to see the people and the leaders of the working men recognise the advantage which would be gained to the country by it. But, my Lords, I submit for your consideration that it is not sufficient to prove that this system is useful, or that it has advantages. If you are going to make so great a change, surely you must also prove that it is necessary, and that we cannot be defended without it.<lb/>
Now, let me say a word on that subject. I do not like going back, as the gallant Field-Marshal did, to what happened in 1800. I do not know that it is a subject that we can entirely draw our conclusions from. All the facts that I mentioned just now as to the straits in which we found ourselves in the late war were well known to the noble and gallant Field-Marshal when he became Commander-in-Chief, and I cannot help asking myself what has occurred since he vacated the post in the last five years to make it necessary for us to adopt this great change. In that connection I would urge upon your Lordships this consideration.
<col>290</col>
The noble Earl spoke of this change as being a slight sacrifice to be asked of the people of this country. The speech of the noble Duke who seconded him certainly gave the idea that it was no great change, that it was merely the development of the present Territorial system. I think that the noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, did genuine service to this House by pointing out that it is not only a great change, but a fundamental change. Do not let us go into this subject with our eyes shut. I am not going to say that circumstances may not arise in which we must do it, but let us be frank and genuine with the country if we do do it. I agree with every word that fell on this point from the Duke of Northumberland. If such a sacrifice is necessary, let us count the cost and do our duty. But do not let us represent to the country that it is what it is not going to be.<lb/>
I should indeed be wanting if, from the experience which has come to me during many years of public service, I did not very respectfully suggest to the noble and gallant Earl that he has undervalued the difficulty of carrying this change into effect, that he has underrated the training which it will be necessary to give, that he has underestimated the cost to which the country must be put, that he has not, as I fear, grappled with the difficulty of providing officers for this immense force, and, above all, that he has not sufficiently relieved your Lordships' minds as to certain difficulties which must be met with regard to the Regular Army. I cannot help feeling at the very outset that there was a certain weakness in the Bill when we heard the noble and gallant Earl apologising to us for taking so short a period of training as four months, and found him seconded by the noble Duke whose Commission, after great consideration and after hearing all the military witnesses, asked for a year's training. There, again, I know that if the noble and gallant Earl took a regiment of the Guards, with Guards officers, Guards non-commissioned officers, and even 100 or 200 Guards privates, he would probably find himself able to put men with four months training into the ranks, and to get a very fair result with them after the four months were over. But that is not the condition. We are not to have all Regular officers. We are to have some. We are not to have a large nucleus of the best trained
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0149"/>
<col>291</col>
troops, and the question I ask myself is what would happen if your Lordships passed this Bill this week and if it came into operation on January 1 next. I will only say, so far as my experience goes, I do not care who the military advisers of the Crown may be, I do not care what Government is in office, before two years have elapsed, you will have the whole of the military advisers coming forward and saying that four months training is insufficient, and that they must make a much larger demand upon the patriotism of the country if we are to have a sufficient defence. That, again, is deeply involved in the question of cost.<lb/>
I do not want to enter into a discussion as between the National Service League and the Government as to the question of cost, but my conviction is that you will not be able to run this force on the cheap; you will not be able to save those &#x00A3;2,000,000 in pay, for which credit has been taken; and unless you can change the whole sentiment of the country you will be forced to pay good wages to those you take against their will, and not less pay than the Regulars. Having done that, you will find yourselves not merely involved in higher pay but in longer training than is allowed. for. Moreover, you will be forced into a very large expenditure for the purpose of providing barracks, I do not say for the whole of the force, but in any case the cost would be enormously increased. Again, there is the question of officers. These points are points of extreme importance. How are your officers to be got? Are they to be voluntary, or are they to be compelled to serve beyond their four mouths?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00702"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: You will hear later how it is proposed officers are to be found. They will be compelled, as everybody else will be compelled, to come forward and serve. There is no difficulty in other countries in getting officers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00703"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: You cannot train an officer in four months, and the whole success of this compulsory training depends upon this, that the shorter you make it for the men the more it is absolutely necessary to have the best officers you can find. I do not know what the military view would be, but I submit that a year would not be an undue period of training to ask for in the case of an officer; and if you can only compel him for four months
<col>292</col>
how are you to obtain these officers? And be it recollected that out of the 11,000 officers at this moment needed for the Territorial Army you are short by 1,700. No power on earth has yet enabled us to get the right number of officers for our volunteer forces. If you can only get within 1,700 of 11,000, how are we going to get the extra 9,000 required under this Bill? I do not say it is an insuperable problem, but it is one which is not solved by the Bill, and you will have to make a much greater demand on the patriotism of the country than the noble and gallant Earl professed to make in the proposals we have heard this evening.<lb/>
And, again, I feel most strongly as regards the effect on the Regular Army. At present you keep 260,000 men in the Regular Army, and of these, 120,000 are abroad. You have to depend on the Regular Army for your garrisons, for your striking force. You have to depend upon your Regular Army for your first shock of war. Your Regular Army at present costs you &#x00A3;18,000,000. Your Territorial Forces and your Special Reserve are to cost you &#x00A3;5,000,000, when you get to the normal. In order to get that &#x00A3;5,000,000, the Secretary of State thought it necessary to disband a number of regiments, and make a reduction in the Regular Army to the extent of &#x00A3;1,500,000. Now, the Secretary of State found soldiers to advise him that it was possible to reduce a million and a half of the money on the Regular Army in order to find &#x00A3;5,000,000? Suppose this new force is to cost &#x00A3;10,000,000, and that is a moderate estimate, in addition to the present cost. Does any member of this House believe that the Secretary of State would not find himself advised or obliged to reduce, out of the &#x00A3;18,000,000 spent on the Regular Army, something more in order to make up this enormous extra charge which would give him, behind the Regular Army, so much greater security than he has at present? My Lords, I do look upon it as one of the most vital considerations in the whole of this question of compulsion for home defence that you should not cut down the Regular Army below the strength necessary to fulfil the duties cast upon it.<lb/>
Then again, there was the question of recruiting. The noble and gallant Earl gave us some further considerations which, he said, led to the belief that military
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0150"/>
<col>293</col>
training would cause an increase, or, at all events, would give a stimulus to recruiting for the Regular Army. I hesitate to put my opinion against his in any way, but may I point out what a flaw there seems to be in that reasoning? The noble and gallant Earl said that the Militia when they were embodied between 1805 and 1813 very largely enlisted in the Regular Army, but what the noble and gallant Earl did not, I think, fully realise in making that statement was that these men were permanently embodied at home whether they liked it or not, and the question was whether a man who could not go back to civil life, had the spirit and the courage and the love of adventure to cause him to enter the Regular Army and fight for his country abroad. But it is not the case in this instance. In this instance you will have men who will be forced to do their duty at home, and they would be asked to abandon all their chances in civil life within their reach in order to join the Army.<lb/>
May I remind the noble Earl of an enterprise in which he and I were engaged in changing the period of service. We had before us the whole question of re-enlistment after service, and we had the whole experience of 8.000 men in the Guards to guide us. How were we misled. The Guards, who were only getting eightpence and ninepence a day, all these fine men, who had the best association for finding them work when they went back to civil life, at a time when the noble and gallant Earl and myself changed the service in the Army from seven years to three, the Guards with all those advantages, re-enlisted to the extent of about thirty per cent.; and yet when we did the same thing with the Line, not leaving them with eightpence or ninepence, a day, but offering them eighteen pence, the young men who were serving at distant stations, who could not be certain of employment upon their return home, and had none of the advantages possessed by the Guards&#x2014;the result was that in the first year only between twenty and twenty-five per cent. re-enlisted, as compared with the sixty or seventy per cent. we had been led to anticipate. My Lords, that is an instance I venture to give your Lordships as showing how great a danger you may run into if you rely on your men raised compulsorily extending their service to the Army.<lb/>
Under this Bill you are going to try and teach men in four months what the Germans
<col>294</col>
teach their soldiers in twenty-two months. As the noble and gallant Earl has said, the idea is that you are going to give them work, work, work, and if you have good officers they will be forced to work these men in order to train them. I have the greatest doubt whether after men have seen the very worst side of military life they will be so enamoured of it that they will be willing, to the extent of 35,000 or 40,000 a year, to join the Regular Army as they do at present. These seem to me to be the main difficulties, or, at all events, points which must be seriously considered before any such scheme is adopted. On the other hand, if there is difficulty, I agree with the Duke of Northumberland that the only way by which it can be possibly got over is by a consensus of military opinion that we are not now sufficiently defended. My Lords, that consensus of opinion is wholly lacking at this moment. We have had speeches made by the Secretary of State which I have personally deplored, and against which I have protested time after time. I do not believe that by the addition of 60,000 or 70,000 men to the Militia force, what may be called the Special Reserve, you have increased your striking power abroad, as the Secretary of State has told us, by 90,000 men. I do not believe that you turn the men from the Militia, by writing on a piece of paper, into Regular soldiers, or that you increase your Regular Army. I personally have, so far as I can, protested against this thing.<lb/>
If I may call your Lordships' attention to one figure, I will show you to what an extent it has been carried under the Army Council. If you will turn to the Return sent out on October 1 last, showing the state of the Special Reserve on that date, you will find there were 59,500 men in the Special Reserve, but of these 16,500 were under twenty years of age. Therefore, assuming that every man on that list was fully trained, you would have had only 43,000 men fit to go abroad. And yet I turn to the War Office Paper circulated last week, and I look to see what was the strength of the Special Reserve to go abroad, and I find that on January 1 there were 50,777 men on the Special Reserve. Three months earlier, according to the last Return, there were only 43,000 over twenty years of age out of 50,777 of the Special Reserve who are mentioned as being available, after the usual deductions have been made, for service abroad in January, 1909. I cannot but look with deep regret and deep suspicion
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0151"/>

on these exaggerations. I do not think they would stand the fire of a Committee of this House or any other Committee, but the difficulty in which we are placed is this, that one by one every statement has been vouched for by the Army Council. I do not want to put on the military advisers of the Crown any responsibility they ought not to properly bear, but I do remind your Lordships, with all seriousness, that the military advisers of the Crown are not the subordinates but the colleagues of the Secretary of State. He is not merely their mouthpiece as the head of the office. They sign the Estimates. They are responsible for the Estimates, and if that responsibility does not exist, then I say the whole position of the Army Council as we have been led to believe it must be regarded as a sham.<lb/>
But, in addition to that, Mr. Haldane has, throughout his career as Secretary of State, vouched his colleagues for every change he has made. With your Lordships' permission I will give you three or four quotations. In 1906, on July 12, Mr. Haldane said in the House of Commons:&#x2014;
<quote>"I cannot express my obligations too deeply to my colleagues of the Army Council for assisting me in the way they have done to work at the scheme of reorganisation which I have to present, and on the hypothesis that reductions are right&#x2014;the whole-hearted concurrence they have expressed in a proposal which, just because it is their own, I believe will result in the increase of the efficiency of the British Army by 50 per cent."</quote>
Well, that whole-hearted concurrence was in the reduction of ten battalions of the Army, and in the reduction to the particularly low strength of forty-two batteries of Artillery which his previous body of military advisers had advised every previous Secretary of State was absolutely necessary for the work. On February 25, 1907, he said:&#x2014;
<quote>"I may say emphatically that the Army Budget this year is a soldier's Budget."</quote>
That, my Lords, covers the whole of the changes made in 1907, and I felt this state of things so deeply that I ventured in this House to address Lord Portsmouth as to whether two officers in a special degree&#x2014;namely, General Nicholson, who, I may add, served with me in the War Office, and General French&#x2014;were or were not satisfied with the reduction about which I felt so strongly that I had indeed in public discussions stated that I believed it to be a military crime. I was told&#x2014;
<col>296</col>
<quote>"I am permitted by General Nicholson to say that he is a member of the Army Council, and he accepts the fullest responsibility for the decision arrived at."</quote>
And he went on to say that it was very unusual, that General French should not be quoted, because the Reports of the Inspector-General were highly confidential and could only be given to Parliament. But here we have the opinion of General French, which supplies one of those curious hiatuses as between the present Under-Secretary of State and the late Under-Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00704"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I hope my friend has taken the trouble to read correctly what was said about General French. What was said was that it was a very unusual thing to show this Report at all, and he implied that it was not to be taken as a precedent. It was so stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00705"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I do not complain of the noble Earl's position. I have no doubt he was stating what was exactly correct from his official standpoint; but, at all events, when the Inspector-General agrees with the system we all have the advantage of his views. With these broad facts which I have brought forward, one cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that the military advisers of the Crown expressed themselves as satisfied with the system His Majesty's Government are establishing. What is it? It gives us 600,000 troops at home, as shown on this Paper: 330,000 available for abroad and 270,000 at home. We require 150,000 men to go abroad and 150,000 in garrison, and it was the opinion of the late Government that an army of at least 150,000 men should be available for field purposes at home. I understand the Government are satisfied, their military advisers are satisfied, that out of those 600,000 men, when the system has reached its full development, they will be able to obtain the forces which they consider necessary. Lord Newton has complained that we are giving a vote of confidence in the Government. I entirely join with the noble Duke in repudiating that construction of this Amendment. We are simply saying this, that we cannot make this great change if, in the opinion of the military advisers of the Government, it is unnecessary for home defence. If the Government tell us, on the authority of their military advisers, that these 600,000 men are not enough; if we are told we are not defended; that there is
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0152"/>
<col>297</col>
no prospect of meeting the needs of the situation under a voluntary system, then I would join hands with the noble Duke behind me and say we will take any step which is necessary to secure the safety of the country.<lb/>
We are ready to make any sacrifice which any Government may call upon us to make, whether it be in purse or popularity, to do so. But I urge upon your Lordships that you will indeed take a grave responsibility if, against the advice of the trusted advisers of the Government, without allowing the system upon which they have placed reliance to be fairly tried, you proceed to charge upon the House of Commons&#x2014;for you have not merely to deal with a resolution or an abstract proposition&#x2014;the duty of finding an extra five millions of money. I believe that if we do so, instead of advancing, as we all desire, we shall retard the establishment of an efficient military system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00706"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am at a great and obvious disadvantage in having to stand up and oppose, on a military question, so great, and, in many ways, so unrivalled a military authority as the noble and gallant Field-Marshal whose Bill we are discussing to-night. But I am encouraged to a certain extent in doing so, because I feel that the Bill we are discussing is much more the Bill of the National Service League than the the Bill of Lord Roberts. We all know the opinions of Lord Roberts on our military forces, and we have all heard what steps he considers necessary to place them in a proper condition. All I can say, my Lords, is that anything that you are going to get under this Bill is totally and absolutely unlike what the noble and gallant Earl has asked for in this House on previous occasions. He has stated that in his view we are liable to an invasion by an enemy falling upon us in large numbers, like a bolt from the blue, and we must be prepared to receive them at the very outset of hostilities. He says, in order to meet the invasion, he considers it necessary that we should have a citizen Army of no less than 600,000 men. In the scheme set forth in the Bill and in the estimate of the National Service League there is no provision for an Army of 600,000 men, and no provision for making it ready to meet Continental troops at the outset of hostilities.<lb/>
<col>298</col>
Let us first consider the question of numbers. There will be every year 150,000 recruits trained. The men in their second and third and fourth years will be brought out to undergo a fortnight's training, and they will number about 400,000. Behind that there is to be a reserve of about 800,000 men. Well, there is certainly material for forming an army of more than 600,000 men if you wish to do it. But in the first place, the estimate of the National Service League states that there is to be no charge for the Reserve&#x2014;that is to say, your Reserve is not to be organised, drilled, clothed or equipped&#x2014;it is not even to be armed. Therefore, under those circumstances, your Reserve will not be ready when the bolt from the blue falls and you have to mobilise your Territorial Forces. What remains? You have the 150,000 recruits. Well, if our enemy is going to be kind enough to make his invasion at the end of the recruits' term, I daresay you will include these 150,000 recruits in your fall Army. Should he come at any other time, it is out of the question that you should include them in your Army. That keeps you down to 400,000 men. But 80,000 come out for your Special Reserve. If you are going to have a Special Reserve, you will have to take it out of the class to which these men belong&#x2014;from dep&#x00F4;t battalions and dep&#x00F4;t units, because you cannot have units serving in the field, with large drafts taken from them. If you take 80,000 men out of the 400,000 men you are left with an Army of 320,000 men available for immediate mobilisation, as compared with an establishment for the present Territorial Forces of 313,000. The net increase for the purposes for which you say it is required is 7,000 men.<lb/>
Then I come to the question of efficiency. How far is this force, raised and trained in this way, going to be capable of meeting the trained Continental troops in an outbreak of war? In all that we have said and thought and done with regard to the Territorial Forces, we have drawn a hard and fast distinction between the training of the individual and the training of the unit. It is quite true that under this scheme your individual is going to be more highly trained than, at any rate, a large number of the Territorial Forces, but what about the training of the unit? If you are only going to have a fortnight's embodied training during the year, no forces under those cir-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0153"/>
<col>299</col>
cumstances can very well be trained within the limitations laid down here. That force will not be capable of taking the field instantly. The considered opinion of the General Staff on this question is that while they do not underrate the value of the training which the individual has received during the time he is a recruit, a force such as this, which will only have had an average minimum of three weeks, or an average maximum of five weeks, of embodied training, will not be fit to do what you ask it to do, set free your Expeditionary Force, and take the field against foreign invaders on the outbreak of war.<lb/>
There is nothing to show whether you propose to train recruits with the units to which they will eventually belong during the period of their recruit training. If you do not, then the average period of embodied service of your force will be three weeks. If you do, its average period of embodied service will be five weeks. Neither period is adequate to make the force fit for immediate hostilities on the outbreak of war. I believe that in the opinion of all soldiers those troops would not be capable of taking the field on the outbreak of war. In the soldiers' mind, there would be no question. I can claim the support of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts, on this point, because when he was asked before the Norfolk Commission whether the Militia and the Volunteers with six or eight months embodied training would, unaided by Regular troops, be equal to such a task, he replied that&#x2014;
<quote>"in such an event the Auxiliary Forces would be considerably better than they are now, but I cannot believe it would be adequate to leave the defence of the country to them, without the assistance of the Regular troops."</quote>
But there are other points in the training and the efficiency of the machine besides the amount of embodied training you give it, and first stands the question of the officers. I observe that the system which is to be adopted is that when a man has passed through his recruit training if he wishes to take a commission as an officer he should go through a second period of training as a subaltern. No mention is made as to how you are to get him. He is to cost the State for that period of five months the sum of &#x00A3;50. Out of that &#x00A3;50 he is to be clothed, fed, housed, and everything else. He will be exceedingly lucky if, after the period of five months, he will
<col>300</col>
receive in the matter of salary the princely stipend of &#x00A3;1 a week. I fail to understand how you are going to get officers in sufficient numbers to give up a considerable part of their second year in order to take a commission in the Territorial Forces. But under these proposals for subalterns, there is not one word said in the Bill or in the estimate to indicate that any steps are to be taken or any money spent on the higher training of officers. You propose to have a large number of Regular officers, but you will have to have a large number of Territorial officers who will want a great deal more training than the fortnight you propose, if you want them to take the field at once.<lb/>
On this question of providing officers, I know that before this debate is much older we shall have the case of Switzerland thrust at us. We shall be told that there is no difficulty in finding officers there. That is quite true. But you cannot compare the case of Switzerland and the case of this country. You have to take in all these questions the psychological facts and conditions. Switzerland has no Navy and no Regular Army, and the possibility of the invasion of Switzerland is far more imminent than it is here. Switzerland concentrates upon her Army, the one national institution of the kind they have got, and is it wonderful that you should get people to come forward under conditions much less arduous than the conditions which are proposed here, in order to take commissions in these forces?<lb/>
Take the case of Germany. You find that the difficulty of getting officers is exceedingly great there. In fact, they can only get the supply of officers they require for mobilisation by giving them a bribe which you cannot give under this system. They let them off a year's training, but your term of embodied training is too short to make that recommendation here. For those two reasons, which are the two principal factors in determining the efficiency of the forces, I see no advance on the present system in the Territorial Army. Your embodied training is no longer, possibly it is not so regular, and the system of training officers seems to me to be lamentable in its weakness. Then you have to take the difference between a force serving voluntarily, and a force serving compulsorily. There are men belonging to the new units of the Territorial Forces
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0154"/>
<col>301</col>
who, during the past year, have done five or six drills a night throughout the whole year, which is as much as men would have done under this scheme in their four or six months of recruit training. You have that as an asset. You have the spirit which animates a force of this kind and which cannot be so strong when it is a force raised by compulsion.<lb/>
I see it is proposed under this scheme that the greater part of these 150,000 men are to be trained in camps. Presumably that will be in summer and not in the winter time. That raises a social problem of extreme importance. Generally speaking the labour market expands in the spring and contracts in the autumn. You will be taking the greater part of those 150,000 troops away on an expanding labour market, and on a contracting market you will throw back the greater part of them. That will produce a problem of unemployment which will take more than the ingenuity of the Tariff Reform League to solve. And it is quite inevitable that before you have had that system in force long, you will have a demand that men shall not be taken away from an expanding market, but that they shall go to training when the labour market is contracting. This means winter training entailing expenditure on barracks and housing generally.<lb/>
There is a question, which I believe is influencing people here, with regard to the effect this scheme is going to have on national physique. Well, I fail to see how a system of this sort, which is going to take men already of the highest physique and to discard men of the lowest physique, is to do any lasting good to the general physique of the nation. If you do that you are bound to divide your population into two parts, the part whose physique is gradually improving, and the part whose physical development you leave alone and which is going to deteriorate.<lb/>
Then, after the first training, in subsequent years they are to be brought out for drills. We have great difficulty at present in the Territorial Force in getting drills carried out in such a way that they are of a useful and instructive nature. Owing to the nature of the physical standard, the majority of your Army will be drawn from the country districts; they will be scattered all over them, and when
<col>302</col>
you consider the tremendous difficulty you have got in collecting men for drill, and the tremendous expense in getting them together, it will be impossible in a large number of places to have more than what is called squad drill. What good squad drills are going to do men who are supposed to have been given a thorough recruit training I cannot understand. It does not show that the thing has ever been thought out in detail, or, if it has, it has been thought out in a very unmilitary manner.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the Regular officers you propose to provide. At the present time the Regular officers with the Territorial Forces number 440. Under this scheme it is proposed to take 2,250 officers. Where they are to come from perhaps we shall hear from the supporters of this Bill. Possibly they may know of some hitherto untapped source from which they will be able to get men of the officer class. But unless that is so&#x2014;and after all, we have explored most of those places ourselves pretty thoroughly&#x2014;this inevitable fact remains, that if you are going to take these 2,250 officers, you will cut short your supply for the Regular Army. This Bill seems to have been conceived simply and solely in the interests of this force which is going to be raised and at the expense of the Regular Army. When this Territorial Force is out for training, officers serving with Regular troops at home are to go and help. But the Regular officer during the summer is actually occupied during the whole of his time training with his unit, and if you are going to take those officers away from their units the Regular Army cannot but suffer.<lb/>
On the question of how this system is going to affect recruiting for the ranks, I cannot add anything to what the noble Viscount has said. I think, however, the noble Viscount is exceedingly generous in placing before us so fully the failure which occurred during his time in getting the three years men to prolong their service. This thing is, to a certain extent, a matter of speculation, and if the National Service League can produce no better proof than the Duke of York's School to back their theory, I can only say that this is fraught with the most disastrous possibilities to the Regular Army. Now I come to the question of the cost. We have been twitted with the fact that our estimate of twenty
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0155"/>
<col>303</col>
millions has come down to eight millions. It is quite true it has dwindled, but not so much as the million men whom we were to put into the field, on which the estimate was based, have dwindled. In fact, when I consider the gigantic drop from a million to 320,000 as the force we were to put in the field, our figures have kept up remarkably well. But it was definitely stated that our estimate of twenty millions was for a force of a million men, fully equipped and thoroughly organised.<lb/>
We have had on this question of cost another estimate. I would like to express my thanks to the National Service League for their courtesy in supplying us with advance copies of that. On the basis of that we have put forward our estimate of eight millions. We have said it is quite a rough estimate, and until a great deal more of the detail has been marked out, it must remain a rough estimate. But I am certain there are a large number of points on which we have under-estimated. For instance, we have omitted something to which the Duke of Northumberland drew attention&#x2014;the machinery for applying this recruiting system. We have omitted that, and so has the National Service League. We have not taken into account the cost of provision of officers for the Special Reserve. We have omitted actual charges for ranges, training areas, and, what I believe will inevitably come later&#x2014;the provision of barracks. Therefore, obviously, our estimate is an under-estimate. But such as it is, it seems to have touched the National Service League on the raw, because we have had this morning a rejoinder on our estimate, couched in terms which can best be described as hysterical. I have read their document with some care. I have submitted it to the financial experts of the War Office, and the outcome is not to shake any single one of the conclusions we came to. The document, therefore, is what I am tempted to call distinctly amateurish.<lb/>
We are charged with accusing the National Service League of making their calculations by taking the average cost of the soldier and dividing it by the number of times in which he comes up. When we did that we took the words out of the original estimate. They say it is not fair. They say the only charge for men of all ranks at home is &#x00A3;72 odd per annum, which is &#x00A3;3 for fifteen
<col>304</col>
days, as fifteen days is one twenty-fourth of a year, and &#x00A3;3 is one twenty-fourth of &#x00A3;72. The fact that the same fallacious proportional method is applied to the five months training does not justify the "fifteen days" calculation. We point out that there is a very large number of things under which expense is incurred, on which the cost is very much greater than the one twenty-fourth part of that sum as indicated by the National Service League. We are also taken to task on the question of officers. When we point out that the provision of officers is absolutely insufficient, it is said that we are not taking into account those 150 Colonels and 300 Majors of the Regular Army who are going to do duty. Of course, we have taken count of them; but does the National Service League really mean that these 450 Field Officers of the Regular Army are going to fill the whole of the higher units of this Army which is to be raised? Because if not, and of course that is an impossibility, then you have to provide for higher officers, and there is no amount in the National Service League's estimate for that. I believe the scheme as it stands is hopelessly costly and hopelessly unworkable. But, if you are going to have unlimited funds and the power of applying compulsion, none of these difficulties are insuperable. They are all capable of emendation, and there is no doubt you can devise a scheme which is less impracticable.<lb/>
But there is a much more important question than details involved in this. It is a great question of principle. The noble and gallant Earl maintains that if we adopt this system we are going to strengthen and increase our power of taking the offensive. It is because we believe that the very opposite of that will be the outcome of this, that our power of taking the offensive will be weakened and not strengthened, that we oppose this or any other system of compulsion. Our belief is that the more you draw the centre of gravity of your defensive system into home defence, the more you will impair the power of taking the offensive, the more you will starve those forces which will have to take the offensive, both in men and money. Take the question of finance. It is going to cost you at least &#x00A3;8,000,000. Is there any man in this country prepared to get up and say that there is the faintest intention on the part of this country, in addition to the already heavy expenditure on the Regular Army and Navy, to add another &#x00A3;8,000,000 to the cost of home
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0156"/>
<col>305</col>
defence? That is one of the most crucial points in the whole question. Can any common-sense person think there is any possibility of this country going to saddle itself with another &#x00A3;8,000,000? Well, then, what is the result? If you are going to have this system you will have to take that money eventually from the funds available for the Navy and the Regular Army.<lb/>
Our view that this encouragement of the Homo Defence Force reacts unfavourably on the other forces is backed by the whole experience of history. This, after all, is no new question. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal has quoted the experience of this country during that long period which followed the French Revolution, but he entirely ignored the earlier experiences of the Army during the same war. For the purposes of this discussion you can divide that time into two parts&#x2014;before and after Trafalgar. During the period before Trafalgar, the history of the Army and the measures that were taken led to what the historian Hallam called "an ignominious panic of invasion." And what do you find? You find a parallel of the system which is now being advocated applied in full force. You find the Militia ballot being applied, and Militiamen being compulsorily raised. You find every kind of home defence being brought into existence&#x2014;Yeomanry, Volunteers, Fencibles, and so on. In fact, you had a concentration on home defence at that time, and what was the result? Did it set free the Expeditionary Force and enable the Regular Army to take its part in the wars? It killed the Regular Army and the Expeditionary Force. The record of the Regular Army of that time is one of the most disastrous things in history. It is a long record of expedients, desperate and very often dishonourable, to obtain men. Men were crimped into the Army, and sometimes bribed, as much as eighty guineas being given to a man to join the Army, and foreign mercenaries had to be hired to fight our battles. That was because we had concentrated on home defence.<lb/>
It was not until after Trafalgar that people got out of their heads the idea that the first and only duty of the Regular Army was to defend these shores, and we began to develop our military strength
<col>306</col>
abroad. And then, after the Militia had been embodied for years and years, efforts were made to induce them to volunteer for service abroad. That is perfectly true; but the lesson of those wars is that when the Government and the people of this country concentrated upon home defence our power of taking the offensive simply waned to nothing, and that when home defence fell into a secondary position we were able once more to take the offensive. You have only to read the two brilliant books by Mr. Fortescue about that period, and the speeches of Mr. Windham, the most able of War Ministers of that period, and you will see running through them, repeated over and over again, the fact that home defence killed all possibility of maintaining a Regular Army. The same thing happened later. After Waterloo you had the home defence school beginning to get the upper hand again, with the result that when the Crimea took place the most appalling defects were revealed in the Regular Army.<lb/>
The defects that were revealed in our Regular Army at that time led to the policy of building fortifications. It was not until Mr. Cardwell came into power that we at last got a clear view, and a clear policy with regard to our Army. It was recognised as a necessity to have in this country a force capable of taking the offensive. That view has steadily progressed from that time. Mr. Stanhope, when Minister for War, was the first man to produce a concrete Expeditionary Force of two Army Corps. Another step was that taken by the noble Viscount himself in the direction of establishing three Army Corps, and the next step has been the reorganisation which we have set up. What does all this show? It shows that you cannot concentrate your efforts, attention and resources on home defence without impairing your power of taking the offensive. That is our true policy. It is an historical fact that it has been our system of regarding our neighbours' coast line as our frontier that has rendered us immune from invasion. The lesson of history is that when you have concentrated on home defence, and spent an undue proportion of money on it, the power of taking the offensive has inevitably suffered. This scheme seems to me to be liable to undo the work of the last forty years. It is taking up a sort of pre-Cardwellian attitude of mind, and if the country is going to be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0157"/>
<col>307</col>
asked to do that, it will be but a very short time before the Regular Army is in a pre-Cardwellian condition.<lb/>
In spite of the fact that history shows that our success has always been obtained by the interdependence and co-operation of our Navy and Army, and that, in following out that principle, the Committee of Imperial Defence has been set up, and the co-operation of the Navy and Army in policy has been very much more closely brought together, we have never heard all through the many debates which we have had, and in the publications of the National Service League, any authoritative statement of the naval question from any body really in a position to state with authority and knowledge what the views and the attitude of the Navy is on this question. We are discussing the question of home defence in its narrowest sense against Imperial defence in its widest sense. There never was a time in which our responsibilities with regard to Imperial defence were greater than they are at the present moment. I will quote figures which show how important it is to consider this question from the Imperial standpoint. The Empire is by no means lacking in men trained to arms. The total military forces of the Empire amount to something like 1,200,000 men. But out of that number of men who are available for service outside their particular country&#x2014;and in taking that you have to exclude the Native Army of India which may be legally taken outside, but whose use outside is restricted by a whole number of considerations&#x2014;is 416,000, and they are scattered all over the world, while the Expeditionary Force, which, after all, is the practical thing, is, or will very shortly be, 166,000 men. That is to say, your Expeditionary Force, your striking force out of the 1,200 000 men you have got in the Empire, is 166,000. Under these conditions I think nobody who looks at the problem from the Imperial standpoint will do anything which is likely, as we say this scheme is, to decrease the power of the forces which are to take the offensive. It was after full consideration of these facts and with the object of giving effect to the principles which I have attempted to lay down, that we were led to the recent reorganisation of our military forces, and the present balance between the forces for home defence and the forces capable of serving abroad was struck.<lb/>
<col>308</col>
Our position in relation to home defence is this. We consider that a home defence force on the lines of the present Territorial Force is essential, but that, should we ever find ourselves at war under conditions which rendered us liable to invasion on a considerable scale on the outbreak of hostilities, our military system as a whole will be stronger and our power of taking the offensive greater if the duty of repelling invasion is at first shared by the Territorial Force and by part of the Regular Army, than it would be if we were to set up an exclusively home defence force, trained up to the pitch of being able to meet a large body of Continental troops immediately it was mobilised, which would necessitate a system far more burdensome and costly even than that which we are now discussing. That is our position on home defence in a nutshell, and on those lines we intend to go forward with the scheme which we have laid down. We have no intention of making any modification, and I have heard no argument which calls for it. Besides being a sound scheme, drawn up on sound lines and principles, it has the advantage of being a scheme which meets with the approval of the country.<lb/>
Our Regular Army at the present moment is in a higher state of organisation than it has ever been before. The Special Reserve, in spite of all prophecies of failure, is attracting a good class of man. That man is being well trained, and the Special Reserve is already practically ninety per cent. of its strength. The Territorial Force, which has only been in existence fourteen or fifteen months, already numbers 270,000 men. During those months it has taken no fewer than 144,000 recruits. It is animated by a glorious spirit and by the set intention of making itself as efficient as it is possible under the conditions it which it serves. It has done more than any scheme put forward by the National Service League could ever do. It has struck its roots firmly and deeply in the national life of the country, and I believe that the country means to do everything it can to make the Territorial Army a success, and worthy of the great task put upon it. Under such conditions I have no fear that the proposals of the National Service League will ever bear fruit. I believe that the present system will always stand against them. They are not required for the military necessities of the country. The proposals
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0158"/>
<col>309</col>
which they make would be an intolerable burden and entirely opposed to the spirit and feeling of the country, and they are being advocated by arguments which I believe will not appeal to the great mass of the people.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00708"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF EXETER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the few words I intend to say in support of the Bill now before the House will be directed to an issue which from the point of view of this debate must necessarily be somewhat subordinate, but which in itself I am persuaded is of very far-reaching importance. The military and financial considerations, which must necessarily engage the foremost attention of your Lordships' House, have been dealt with in this debate very ably by different speakers, all of whom realise the obvious fact that this Bill is not likely during the present session of Parliament to become the law of the land. The practical difficulties which beset those sides of the matter, and on which I do not purpose to speak, are obvious, and yet I cannot but express the hope, in passing, that in the time which must necessarily elapse before this Bill, or some Bill of this kind, assumes the character of imminent legislation, it will be possible to keep this question before the country and to see to what extent those difficulties are really insuperable.<lb/>
The grounds on which I support this Bill are the moral and physical benefits to the nation which, I think, would distinctly accrue supposing some such measure as this were eventually to become law. It is perfectly true, as the noble Duke said, that it is possible to form the highest idea of the moral and physical benefits which may come with more general military training, without going so far as to wish that that training should be compulsory; but I venture to say that unless military training becomes compulsory those benefits will leave untouched precisely those classes of the population who are most conspicuously in need of them. The moral and physical benefits which I have principally in view are the benefits to the whole life of the young men of this country, who are very much in need of some reinforcement to those manly capacities of endurance and of discipline which have been at the back of whatever in past history our country has achieved to earn the admiration of mankind; and upon the continuance of
<col>310</col>
these qualities our place among the nations of the world must in the future very vitally depend. There are still in our midst, I am quite certain, the high qualities of patriotism and of manliness which have been the glory of England in the past, but those qualities are in need of reinforcement.<lb/>
My Lords, there are forces abroad which are threatening to undermine and to sap those qualities, and some such healthy influence as will be supplied if this Bill or some Bill like it becomes law is likely more than anything else to counteract the evil tendency to softness, indiscipline, and unmanliness which, especially in our town-bred population, is threatening the moral future of our country. We want some influence in the lives of the young men of this country which will drill into them the principle that things have to be done not because they happen to appeal to us, or because we enjoy doing them, but because they must be done, and that life must be lived, not on the principle of pleasing oneself, but of obedience. I am quite certain that in the country where universal military service has taken deepest root&#x2014;a country which I do not in all respects wish to hold up to the admiration or imitation of England&#x2014;yet in that great Continental country the young people at this day carry into all the callings of life upon which they enter the instinct of obedience and discipline to a degree which is increasingly lacking among the young people of this country. It is not merely a question of military discipline and of military obedience, but of that manly discipline of life which faces tasks because they have to be done, and which goes to make the foundations of success in every calling of life.<lb/>
One word, my Lords, I would say in conclusion. I am not supporting this Bill, it is needless to say, in any spirit of what is called militarism, or With any desire to foster or increase that spirit in our country. If I thought that by the establishment of universal military service we would be brought one hair's-breadth nearer to the horrors of war I would not support such a Bill for an instant. If I thought that the establishment of this system would do anything to inoculate our masses with the madness of lust and thirst for war, which sometimes does seize upon whole populations, or would in any way tend to strengthen what is called&#x2014;I must apologise to your Lordships for using such a term&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0159"/>
<col>311</col>
a spirit of jingoism in our midst, I would not support this Bill for one moment. But you do not find the spirit of aggressive militarism in democratic countries like Norway and Switzerland, where this system is now in force. In those countries every young man, as a matter of course, goes through his period of training, and is possessed with the conviction that in the hour of national danger he should not leave it to others, but that it would be his own duty to turn out and give his life, if need be, to the service of his country. What we need in these days is something to stimulate the nobler side of human nature in our great masses, to possess our rising generation more and more with the sense of duty, not only as affecting the concerns of daily private life, but the duty of the individual to the country whose traditions he inherits, and whose protection as a citizen he enjoys; and for that I am certain that in the long run we shall have to look to some such system as prevails in the countries I have just mentioned, and which it is the object of this Bill to make part of the laws of our land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00709"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will only say one or two words just to explain my position with regard to this Bill. My reasons for supporting the Bill now before your Lordships' House are that I honestly believe that without some form of compulsion it would be impossible to get the necessary number of men for the defence of the country. I also object to the burden which should be borne by every able-bodied man of the country being thrown on to the few; and I think that the Territorial Force cannot possibly give the time necessary to make themselves efficient soldiers because they have to compete in the market with those who recognise no responsibility at all in this national duty.<lb/>
I base all my objections to the voluntary system on the two questions of numbers and training. It has been well said by, I think, the military correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, that the period of training appointed for the Territorial Force is altogether inadequate, and that any attempt to increase the training will destroy the Force. In this connection I think it is very difficult for employers, however patriotic they may be, to give sufficient leave as long as they have to compete in the market with those who are
<col>312</col>
not prepared to make similar sacrifices. Under universal service these conditions will disappear, and the willing would no longer be handicapped in having to compete with those who shirk their responsibility. It is not my intention to say anything on the question of finance. The difference, as far as I can make out, is something between three million and four million pounds. All I can say is that I think no price is too great to pay if we can thereby obtain absolute security for the country. One argument generally used against compulsion is that we can get all the men we like under the voluntary system. I entirely deny that statement. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal has shown that if the Territorials were to reach to 350,000 men, which is their establishment under the present system, that number would be utterly unable to guard against invasion.<lb/>
To show the weakness of the military position I will suppose that the Expeditionary Force is out of the country. I know I may be told that it is unlikely that the whole of the Expeditionary Force will be absent at one time. I think that that shows a woefully short memory for, if your Lordships will recollect, during the South African war the country at one time was almost denuded of troops, and I see no reason why those conditions should not recur. The Expeditionary Force consists of 150,000 men, of which 50,000 are Regulars, 70,000 Reserves, and 30,000 are on a Militia basis. I think it wall be generally acknowledged that the proportion of Reserve men in that force is far too great, especially as the Reserves are not, as in the case of the Reserves in foreign armies, called up every year for training. To keep that force in the field for one year would dispose of every man we have outside the Territorial Force, and unless the Force could be kept up to say 160,000 I think that our friendship as an ally would hardly be worth having. The country would then be left with only 250,000 Territorials and they would be short of officers by over 2,000. They would be armed with a gun which is more or less obsolete, which would be hopelessly outranged by the enemy, and they would only be able to get in one shot to every three shots which the enemy could fire. Lord Roberts has shown that the requisite number to provide garrisons and local mobile forces as well as a central mobile force is 600,000 men.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0160"/>
<col>313</col>
I cannot see how under the present system anything like that number can be produced. Under the most favourable conditions and under the most severe pressure, all that we have been able to get at present is 263,000 men enlisted, and that we have done with very much difficulty. I ask your Lordships how it is that the administration of the War Office has always been regarded as a failure, and why it should be looked upon as inferior either to the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, or any other of the public Departments. It has been, and it is at the present moment, administered by one of the ablest and most eminent of our public servants, yet it is impossible to hear anyone say a good word of it. I think the reason is that the task which they have undertaken is an impossible one The conditions under which they act Make success absolutely impossible. Under the voluntary system they have to make bricks without straw, they have to make an army without men. The Duke of Northumberland, in his Amendment, talks of the system which is accepted as sufficient by the military advisers. I should like to point out that these military advisers have no option between the voluntary and the compulsory system. They have to do the best they can under the existing circumstances and existing conditions. If they were asked the plain question as to whether they preferred voluntary or compulsory service I should be very much surprised if they asked for the former. If they did, my Lords, I feel perfectly certain they would get no other officers in the Army to agree with them.<lb/>
The noble Duke made some remarks as to the disadvantages of young men living in barracks because of the companions with whom they might have to associate. I would like to point out to your Lordships that under compulsory service, where everybody has to serve, the tone of the barrack room would be far higher than it is at the present moment. I hardly thought the noble Duke was consistent when he found fault with what I may perhaps call the "scallawags" that would be met in the barrack room, and then did his best to have criminals included amongst the soldiers. I know that I shall be told the country will not have any form of compulsion at the present moment&#x2014;that it is the Englishman's privilege to let other people defend his home, and that it is no business of his. My Lords, I rather
<col>314</col>
think there is a change coming over public opinion in this matter. I do not find the idea of compulsory service now scouted in the way it was a very few years ago. Even amongst the Socialists, Mr. Blatchford and Mr. Hyndman, I notice, have been doing their best to bring before their comrades the fact that they ought to be able to do something for their country. In my opinion compulsory service of some sort is bound to come sooner or later. All I hope is that it may come before and not after disaster. I am glad that this question should have been ventilated in your Lordships' House. It cannot, at any rate, be regarded in any way as class legislation, because every one of your Lordships' sons would come under this provision, and all would have to serve their time. It is for these reasons that I venture to support the Bill brought in by Lord Roberts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00710"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I speak as one of those who share the responsibility for, the framing and introduction of this Bill, as well as for the propaganda we are conducting throughout the country. A great deal of the criticism which we heard from the last three speakers before the adjournment related to details of the Bill, and I should like, if I may, to exhort your Lordships to come back to the question of principle, because, after all, it is a question of principle we are discussing. We are not so unreasonable as to think for one moment that this Bill can pass into law in the present session, or in the lifetime of the present Government, or, possibly, even of the next Government. We know that that is impossible in the present political circumstances. Nevertheless, in introducing this Bill we have an important and a legitimate object in view, and that is to secure the acceptance of the principle which we advocate. We are anxious that your Lordships' House should have the honour, as we regard it, of affirming the principle of universal military service, and of thus giving a lead to the nation. That is our principal object. We have other objects of lesser importance.<lb/>
In the first place, we wish to make our own policy clear. We wish to remove once and for all unintentional misapprehension and deliberate misrepresentation with which we are so constantly assailed. Solely with a view to pursuing our propaganda in the most effective manner, we
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0161"/>
<col>315</col>
wish to find out from the highest authorities and those who have the present responsibility for the Government of this country what, if any, are their objections to the policy which we advocate. We wish to find out who is on our side and who is not. We wish to try our own strength so that the 80,000 in this country who have rallied round our flag may gain even greater confidence than they have now in the cause which they have at heart. In fact, my Lords, this is, to use a military metaphor, a little reconnaissance in force, in which we hope to give their baptism of fire to some of those who aspire to be leaders in our cause. We wish to prove to those who think with us that the members of the League who belong to this House will not deny their faith even though they may suffer the scourge of the "whips" of their political leaders. To those who believe in universal service, it is a faith that can only be held with all the ardour and all the conviction of a religious faith, seeing that everything we hold dear depends upon the security of this country. If, therefore, we think that the security of the country depends on the acceptance of universal service, every one of us necessarily must consider the question far more important than any other question in politics.<lb/>
We are confronted to-night, not with downright straightforward opposition, but with a Resolution which is designed to shirk, to evade, and to postpone the issue. I find it difficult to believe that any noble Lord who values the reputation of this House, let alone his own reputation, will vote for this Resolution. Either you believe in the principle of universal service, or you do not. Whatever your opinion may be, why hesitate to say it? This is not a Party question; it never has been a Party question, and to avoid giving a plain answer to a plain question will not gain credit for either Party from the electorate. I am firmly convinced that what the electors of this country admire most of all is courage of opinion on the part of those who pretend to lead them. I do not think that the people of this country would find fault with any man, to whichever side he may belong, for declaring himself in favour of universal service or against it. What they do object to is the politician who will not say "yes" or "no," but who seeks to burke and to shirk the issue. The noble Duke's Resolution is not merely equivocal and evasive, but, if passed, it would place
<col>316</col>
on record ignorance of the actual circumstances of the time and disregard of an elementary principle of our Constitution, and I still maintain, in spite of what my noble friend said a short time ago, that it would be tantamount to a vote of confidence in the Government.<lb/>
I think most of us agree that the Territorial Army scheme is a very great improvement on the old system. Most of us on this side of the House are doing our very best to further that scheme. Without our aid noble Lords opposite would find themselves in a very awkward fix. But still it is our right and our duty to criticise the policy of the Government&#x2014;their military policy as well as any other part of their policy; and if we pass this Resolution, if there is any meaning in words at all, we debar ourselves from the exercise of that legitimate and rightful function. I say that the Resolution is equivocal and evasive, and that it ignores the actual circumstances. We have the opinion of two Royal Commissions that a home army on a voluntary basis is not amply sufficient to secure the country against all risk of invasion. The Resolution declares that this Bill will involve "unknown demands" upon the national resources. The demands on national resources are not unknown. The actual amount which the institution of our system would cost can be ascertained with mathematical accuracy. At the present moment we have before us two varying estimates, and noble Lords can see for themselves, if they choose to apply themselves to the study of these documents, what the cost would be. Therefore, to say that the measure would involve unknown demands upon the national resources seems to me to be a statement which would stultify this House. Then, again, the Resolution declares that the system advocated by the Bill would "supersede" the present system. The noble Duke who framed this Resolution can hardly have given himself the trouble of studying the Bill. The whole object of the Bill is to complete and to perfect the system which has been instituted by the present Government&#x2014;to give to the Territorial Army system just those two things which every impartial critic admits that it lacks, and that is sufficiency of men and sufficiency of training. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War seems to me to be inflated with pride because we had at the present moment some 270,000 men on
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0162"/>
<col>317</col>
the strength out of an establishment of 315,000. I cannot for the life of me see any cause for pride in it. On the contrary, I think it is absolutely disgraceful that we have not already got the full establishment of the Territorial Force. The noble Lord talked, and I have noticed that his chief also talks, as though the Territorial Army has been raised <i>de novo</i>, as though it were an entirely new Force. The fact is, of course, that it is to a very large extent the Volunteers under a new name and with a different organisation; but to speak as if 270,000 men had been recruited from the civil population in the course of a year is to trifle with words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00711"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Over half of them have been.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00712"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: But, lastly, what I object to almost as much as anything else in this Resolution is the phrase with which it concludes&#x2014;namely, that the system is "accepted as sufficient by the military advisers of His Majesty's Government." My Lords, the responsibility does not rest with the military advisers of His Majesty's Government. If we pass this Resolution, we are lending countenance to the idea which is gaining ground far too much at the present time&#x2014;the idea that responsibility is to be thrown upon the permanent officials of the Government. The military advisers of the Government, as was well said by my noble friend just now, can only advise within the limits of their reference. They advise to the extent to which the Government allow them to advise. The responsibility rests upon His Majesty's Government. But the reponsibility for a question like national defence rests on an even wider basis than the opinion of His Majesty's Government. It is, as has been said over and over again by our greatest Statesmen, a matter not for the Government or for the Department, but for the people themselves. I would rather that any member of this House voted downright against the Second Reading of the Bill than for this Resolution. I find it difficult to describe it in words which would at once express my own opinion and also be in conformity with the conventions of this House, but perhaps I shall be on the safe side if I borrow a favourite expression of the noble Earl the Leader of the House&#x2014;the expression with which he thinks to crush any argument&#x2014;and say it is simply fatuous.<lb/>
I do not propose to deal with the speech of the noble Duke. In the first place, he is
<col>318</col>
not present, and, in the second place, I do not think it is possible to take it seriously. I cannot believe that that speech was made in a serious vein. It seemed to be made in what I will euphemistically call a lighter vein. I should like to say more, but I will content myself with saying that it was in a tone which is utterly inappropriate to the present circumstances. I will add that we who are advocating this measure are hurt and offended that our cause should be treated with so little seriousness. Now, my Lords, I will leave the speech of the noble Duke and will once more refer to the question of principle. We are asking your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill in order to affirm that principle. This is no new principle; it is an old English principle. I daresay the noble Duke would be surprised to hear that it is a principle which is embodied in the law of the land and has been reiterated over and over again in the Statutes of this country. It is, of course, a principle which is accepted in almost every other civilised country in Europe, and it is simply that it is the duty of an able-bodied citizen to take up arms in defence of his country when he is called upon by his Sovereign or by the supreme Government of the State to do so.<lb/>
My Lords, we ask you to meet us on the high ground of principle alone. If you will do so, we are absolutely confident that you must agree with us; but, unfortunately, it is only too clear from what has already been said to-night that you will not meet us on the ground of principle, but that you will seek to evade the question of principle in every possible way. The case is best stated in three plain straight-forward questions. Is it, or is it not, the duty of the citizen to fight for his country at a time of invasion? It is absolutely impossible that any answer should be given to that question except the answer "Yes." The next question is this, Can any man perform that duty properly unless he has been previously trained? I cannot imagine any man giving any answer except "No." Then follows the third question, which is, These things being so, is it not incumbent upon the State to provide, and the citizens to submit to, this necessary training? The answer is of course, "Yes." I challenge any noble Lord to give different answers to those questions. It is impossible, it is inconceivable, that any Member of this House should give a different answer to my first two questions, and the answer to the third follows as a necessary and logical con-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0163"/>
<col>319</col>
clusion, unless you can prove that invasion of this country is absolutely impossible. All I will say on that point, for I am not going to enter into a technical discussion, is that if invasion is impossible why in the name of fortune do we have a Home Defence Army at all? Either we want an army for home defence or we do not. That is the whole question. If we want it, and it is universally recognised that we do, it must be efficient for the only purpose for which it can possibly exist, and that is to resist an invasion of these shores. Efficiency depends mainly upon two things&#x2014;sufficiency of men and sufficiency of training. In arguing the question I think I can assert that there is an immense consensus of expert opinion that you cannot get either under the existing voluntary system, and, as I have already pointed out, we have only got a proportion of the very small establishment.<lb/>
We rest our case then upon necessity, but we are also prepared to defend it on the equally high grounds of justice and advantage. We say that universal service is the only system which is fair as between one citizen and another. We say that it is the only democratic system, and, therefore, the only system that can commend itself to a nation which is perpetually boasting, as we are at the present time, of being democratic. We say it is the only system which recognises that duties and responsibilities must be shared by all alike in the same manner as rights and privileges, for that surely is the whole essence of democracy. We say that apart from defence, universal service would be of immense advantage to the nation for the purpose of improving character and physique, and, consequently, for increasing our industrial efficiency and for promoting our general progress in civilisation. We are confident of agreement, therefore, with anyone who will discuss this question with us on the high grounds of necessity, justice, and advantage. But unfortunately this is just what those who are afraid to face this question will not do, for they seek to draw us into the ravines and morasses of dubious speculation on side issues. If we say it is necessary, and point to the indisputable fact that a nation which is not a nation in arms cannot hope, in the ordinary nature of things, to survive a struggle against nations which are nations in arms, we are confronted with the argument of "the target for the Fleet" or that of "Raid <i>versus</i> Invasion," arguments which are really too foolish for serious discussion.<lb/>
<col>320</col>
We are told, for instance, that a given number of transports might be able to evade our Fleet, but if the number of invading transports was increased, presumably by only a small number, our Fleet would be able to discover them. All I think it necessary to say on that argument is that it is not complimentary to the Royal Navy. It is tantamount to saying of an individual that he can hit a haystack with a gun, but he cannot hit anything smaller in size.<lb/>
Again, there is the argument of the "raid." which is certain to be brought up in the course of the debate, and which assumes that the enemy will begin an invasion with an insufficient force. All I think it necessary to say is that such an argument is not complimentary to foreign strategists. Then, there are others who, ignoring the existence and the recognised necessity of a Home Defence Army, say that we must depend on the Fleet alone. But the whole point, whether we depend on the Fleet alone, or whether we depend on the Fleet assisted, as we think it ought to be, by a Home Defence Army, is that the Fleet must be free to act. The great battles of our Fleet in bygone days were not won off the coasts of this country, or in the Straits of Dover. The battles of the Nile, Trafalgar, and St. Vincent were not won close to these shores, and our Fleet cannot dispose itself in a chain around our coasts solely in order to resist raids.<lb/>
I agree with the Under-Secretary of State for War, Lord Lucas, in all he said about a purely defensive action never having been successful. There must be the power of offence. That is an elementary principle of strategy, and strategy, after all, like statecraft, does not in essence amount to much more than common sense. We have the analogies of the games of cricket and football. You cannot imagine a football team winning a match if it contented itself with merely guarding its goal, and a cricket eleven which numbered no bowlers would not be likely to defeat the opposing side.<lb/>
The noble Lord, the Under-Secretary of State, said he wished the National Service League would enter into the question of the attitude of naval men, and as he has raised it I am only too glad to meet him on that point. He said we have not considered the view of the Navy, and have
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0164"/>
<col>321</col>
made no reference to it. My answer is that in the ranks of the League we have no fewer than seventy flag officers, and, so far as we can judge, it is the opinion of almost every naval man that it is essential the Fleet should be free, and should not be hampered by having to do coast guard duty around these shores.<lb/>
If we attempt to discuss this question of principle from the point of view of justice we are met with catchwords and maxims which have been a fetish of politicians for too long, and which I venture to say are as untrue as they are irrelevant. For instance, it has been suggested this evening that one volunteer is worth ten pressed men. What are the facts? The battles of old, the battles which made us a nation and which built up our Empire, were none of them won by volunteers. I cannot imagine anybody who has an actual personal acquaintance with the circumstances and the work of the present members of the Territorial Force saying that they are the pick of the nation either as regards physique or many of the other qualities which go to make up a first-class soldier.<lb/>
We are told that "the nation will not stand conscription." Our answer to that is that nobody has the right to make that statement until the nation has been asked. The nation has not been asked yet, and the nation has not yet made up its mind, though we believe that it is in a very fair way towards forming a definite opinion on the subject. In view of the defects of the present system, with which any Volunteer officer&#x2014;or Territorial officer, if you like it better&#x2014;is familiar, we say that our system is the only means of securing justice as between one employer and another, as between employer and employed, and as between one workman and another workman.<lb/>
Again, we are told that the introduction of our system would cause a great dislocation of our national life, and an interference with trade and industry. In the first place I should like to refer those who rely on that argument to the actual number which we should have under training under the system we advocate. There is a wild notion abroad that the whole nation would be an armed camp, and that everybody would be clanking about with a sword, or parading through the streets
<col>322</col>
with a rifle. As a matter of fact, however, if the system we advocate were in force I do not suppose any outward difference would be visible anywhere in the country except as regards the general bearing and physique of the people, for the number of men under training each year would not be much greater than it is now. The difference would be that every able-bodied man would take his turn at the duty. Our answer to that argument as regards interference with trade and industry is that you should look at foreign nations. They are able to compete with us, and not unsuccessfully, in spite of universal service. Indeed I should like to tell your Lordships of an experience which I had two days ago, and which bears on this very point.<lb/>
I met a great employer of labour who had just been on a visit to Germany to look at the great engineering establishments there similar to those he controls in this country. He asked this question of one of the owners of a great factory at Leipzig: "How does it affect you if your men are taken away for two years to serve in the Army?" The answer of the German employer was: "We do not fear your commercial or industrial competition so long as you stick to your present voluntary system." He went on to explain that the military service of his men was worth more to them than any amount of schooling. So our argument is that universal service would make, first, a healthier population, and, secondly, would give us more efficient workmen.<lb/>
The noble Duke referred to kindred subjects and spoke as if we had never considered these questions at all. I admit we have never thought it necessary to look at the question from the extraordinary point of view which he has adopted himself, because never yet have I come across anyone who argued against the proposal in the way he has done. For instance, the noble Duke talked of the possible moral dangers to young men if they were obliged to serve. One would almost think that he believed our young men at college or the university were under the care of governesses.<lb/>
I pass on to the remarks of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State, who said he saw no advantage in a system which only improved the physique of half the nation. Accepting the maxim that
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0165"/>
<col>323</col>
"half a loaf is better than no bread," I cannot follow him in his argument that if half the nation were rejected on account of physical inability to serve, there would be no advantage in improving the physique of the other half. My own view is that if you improve the physique even of only half the nation, you thereby insure that the next generation bred by those healthier men will also be improved.<lb/>
Now I will come to objections put forward on behalf of the Government. They are two. The first is&#x2014;and this is the one on which the Secretary of State for War chiefly relies&#x2014;that the system we advocate would interfere with recruiting for the Regular Army. The second is that the cost would be too great. I cannot agree with my noble friend opposite that volunteering has interfered with recruiting for the Regular Army. It is certainly on a small scale the experience of everyone I know who has had to do with volunteering that it actually leads to enlistment in the Army. A man who has had a taste of a soldier's life without being finally committed to it very often eventually goes in altogether for a soldier's life, when he would never have thought of doing so without the preliminary experience.<lb/>
On the question of officers, the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State seemed to feel very great alarm at the prospect of not getting a sufficient number. So far as I can understand, his argument rests on a supposition that there is absolutely no margin of men fit for military service in this country. He appeared to think that if you increase your Regular Army you decrease your Volunteers, and if you increase your Volunteers you decrease your Regular Army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00713"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My point is that if you are going to try to get 2,250 more Regular officers, you cannot obtain them unless you take a worse class of officers than you get at the present time. They are not available.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00714"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I think every man who has had to do with the Auxiliary Forces knows a great many men in his own comparatively narrow circle who would make suitable officers if only they could be persuaded to join. They will not join because they are not sufficiently patriotic or are too lazy, or, in most cases, perhaps, because they would suffer in competition
<col>324</col>
with others whatever their walk of life. I cannot believe, however, that there is absolutely no margin in this country of suitable material either for officers or men, and I feel no alarm on being told that we should have to provide 2,300 more officers. In the first place we are turning Regular officers out of the Army every year who feel that they have any amount of work in them, and who undoubtedly would be qualified to serve under the increased requirements of a larger system.<lb/>
On the question of cost, I hold that no impartial critic would be impressed by the manner in which this aspect of the problem has been dealt with by the War Office. I think the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State has been badly served in this matter, and I do not think I have ever seen a more perfunctory document than that which professes to criticise the estimate of the League. We were told, in the first place, that the cost would be &#x00A3;20,000,000, but it has been shown several times over in the course of this debate that the officials who made themselves responsible for that estimate, and furnished it to important members of the Government, had not even taken the trouble to ascertain what the scheme was which they were criticising. Now, by devices which are sufficiently obvious to those who will take the trouble to read the Papers, they are only able to make it &#x00A3;8,000,000, instead of &#x00A3;20,000,000, though undoubtedly their brief was to cause the system to appear as costly as possible. Yet we are asked in this Resolution to rest satisfied with the opinion of officials who are capable of discrepancies of this kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00715"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I should like to point out, in defence of the officials, that there is no discrepancy whatever. The &#x00A3;20,000,000 cost was estimated when we understood that the noble and gallant Field-Marshal required an Army of a million men, armed, equipped and organised. That has now dwindled down to 320,000 men, and naturally the cost has come down, too. There is no other explanation, and I hope the noble Lord will accept my assurance on the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00716"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I am talking of the discrepancies which have appeared in the Paper some few days ago, and which were pointed out in the statement issued by the National Service League. The noble Lord
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0166"/>
<col>325</col>
criticised the document published by the League as amateurish. I should like to tell him that in compiling it the League had the assistance of at least one former and highly placed official at the War Office; so that if the compilation of our estimate was amateurish, we can legitimately assume that the compilation of that which was issued by the War Office was also amateurish. But our answer to all that is: What of the cost? What does it matter if it does cost more? Surely we can do what other nations do. We see other nations raising and maintaining armies four times larger than our own, and at the same time creating fleets which might become a menace to us. As a matter of fact, on this question of expense I believe it can be fully established that we are paying less for national insurance at the present time in proportion to our population and our wealth and the extent of our Empire than we were 100 years ago.<lb/>
I say it is better to pay even &#x00A3;8,000,000 more by way of annual premium for national insurance than to run the risk of losing &#x00A3;500,000,000 at one fell swoop as the result of a disastrous war. But it would not all be money out of pocket. There are gains to be set on the other side that ought not to be lost sight of. We should gain in the improved health of the people and in the consequent increase of industrial efficiency. We should save in having a smaller bill of sickness for the whole of our people. We do not expect the occupants of the Front Benches to vote for this Bill. Perhaps they do right from the point of view of the custom of Party politics in this country to wait for their mandate; but what we do ask of them is that they should give the nation a fair chance of forming an opinion on this subject and of giving a clear mandate. It is a significant fact that as soon as a man leaves either Front Bench he joins us. You have the notable instances of Lord Rosebery, Lord George Hamilton, and the noble Earl the late Under-Secretary of State for War.<lb/>
It is an equally significant but extremely disconcerting fact that as soon as a man joins the Front Bench he leaves us. I may quote as a notable instance the case of the present Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonel Seely, because it shows what extraordinary changes of opinion are possible even on such a vital question as
<col>326</col>
national defence. Speaking in 1902 Colonel Seely said&#x2014;
<quote>"I consider it would be extremely desirable that it should be obligatory for every man in this country to be trained to arms. I also believe that five-sixth of the people of the country would welcome such a proposition."</quote>
On June 5, 1909, Colonel Seely mocked at what he called the "conscription idea" as a "profound failure," and he added&#x2014;
<quote>"If we can by any method keep to our voluntary system we shall be far more formidable in time of war."</quote>
I have quoted these words in order to show why we cannot, in a matter of this kind, place blind confidence in the guidance of the two Front Benches. But I would venture, with all respect, to say to them, Do not rely on the shortness of public memory and on that indulgence which covers the inconsistencies of Party politicians. This is a serious matter, and the people of this country will not forgive those who mislead them, either intentionally, or unintentionally. If disaster should come, which Heaven forbid, bitter would be the curses which would fall on the heads of those who refrained until it was too late from placing fairly and squarely before the people of the country all the considerations which underlie the vital question of national defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00717"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have ventured to intrude myself on your Lordships' attention on a subject of this kind had it not been for the fact that for years I have been thinking of these matters, and am the founder of an organisation which has done a certain amount of work in preparing the way for the magnificent scheme of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. Though I have no military knowledge to enable me to speak on the matter, I may say that at all events I have had some experience in regard to foreign countries. I was educated in a foreign country, and for six years I was a diplomatist serving abroad. I have visited Germany and other countries even more frequently perhaps than many of your Lordships who travel, and I have only just returned from accompanying a peace mission to Berlin. It has not been mentioned to-night, but what strikes me is that the real danger to this country is a permanent one as long as we have no military force behind our Navy. The more I converse with foreigners and the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0167"/>
<col>327</col>
more closely I get in touch with their ideas the more I find that the reason of this mad competition in armaments is that they think there is a loophole through which they can force their way. If we had compulsory military service in this country we should not have that mad competition in fleets and we certainly should not have any danger of invasion.<lb/>
I am speaking from what I have recently heard in private conversation with men of German and other nationalities. The purport of all the conversations I have had is this: "How did you get hold of your Colonies? Because you were the salt of the earth. Because you knew how to fight. Because in proportion to your population you were able to raise enormous armies. Because you knew how to invade the Continent. Because you fought in Portugal and Spain and overcame." Now they ask: "Are you the same people you were in those days?" They are generally too polite to continue the conversation, and they leave one to answer the question oneself. If you go further and ask them to find a reason for what they say, the answer is: "Oh, you English, you seem to be so dreadfully afraid of defending your own country. How is this? We don't believe you are cowards; but there is something wrong, and we should like to know what it is." Then they say "You have a philosopher who propounded the doctrine of the survival of the fittest. There are some of us who believe that armies are only the handmaid of the Divine Being, and it is for the good of the world that the fittest should rule." They add "We believe we are the fittest, and we have no intention of ceasing to develop ourselves in every direction we choose."<lb/>
We made beautiful speeches to each other&#x2014;the right reverend Prelate the Lord Bishop of Hereford can tell you of them better than myself&#x2014;but it was in private conversation that the good was done. The danger to this country lies in the fact of our acknowledged military weakness. The noble Lord only on Wednesday last told us that the Territorial Force, however good they might be, were not fit to compete with, an equal number of Continental soldiers. What does that mean? That we shall have to keep our whole Regular military force in this country if we go to war for fear of the chance of an enemy being able to force the Channel for twenty-
<col>328</col>
four hours. I ask, Is it the way to consolidate the Empire to say that for six months after the declaration of war we are to seal up the whole of our Army in these islands whilst perhaps our self-governing Colonies or India are being overrun by the enemy? Is that the way to give confidence to our self-governing Colonies? It that the way to prevent unrest in India? Is that the way to show how an Empire can be ruled?<lb/>
I do not propose to go into any military details, for I am not competent to do so, but I think I know something about social questions and I do care for the social condition of the people. Therefore when the Duke of Northumberland says that this service of four months is going to demoralise the whole youth of England I can only answer that I do not believe him. No doubt he believes it himself, but I am entirely of the opposite opinion. I know that my own son as a Volunteer private from one of the Universities went to Aldershot and mixed with the common soldiers of the Regular Army in the most friendly manner. He is now an officer in His Majesty's Guards and I am not aware that he is any the worse for that contact with the soldiers. He told me he had the very highest opinion of the private soldiers whom he met there, and he met them as private soldiers in the public house. I am perfectly certain, and I am speaking from some experience, that the more military discipline you can give to the young men of this country the more will their moral virtues increase. The experience which I have had in social work as the President of the Church Army has shown me for years&#x2014;and I am more and more convinced the longer I live&#x2014;that the danger to this country is not a material or a physical danger, so much as a moral danger. I will tell you what I mean. I have, as I say, just come back from Germany. I know that country well. I was educated there, and I have been spending the last four months there. It has impressed me more and more that the strength of that country lies in the discipline which is given to the population in the nursery and in the school as well as in the Army. It is the discipline which runs through the whole land which gives that people its strength; and, my Lords, it is indiscipline which is so apparent to all who work amongst the people, or who know the people, of our own country. The right reverend Prelates well know
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0168"/>
<col>329</col>
how much of their work is hampered by the lack of training and discipline which is met with in the homes of some of the poorer classes in this country.<lb/>
What we want is discipline. Discipline in the upper classes, discipline in the middle classes, and discipline in the lower classes. If we had more discipline we should not have such a large number of men and women who think nothing of the State and of the community, whose sole idea is pleasure, pleasure, pleasure; and we should not have those "slackers" in the lower classes whose whole idea is how much money they can get out of their employers and how little work they can do. You do not see that in Germany. While in Germany I only saw one man who looked anything like a tramp, but the very morning I arrived in this country I saw two men opposite my own house singing hymns with their hands in their pockets, and as President of the Church Army I knew that it was useless to offer work to them. A few days later I went to my own little cottage in the depth of the country, and when I came out of church I found two men and two women walking along at a snail's pace, with heads down, singing hymns. Having, as I say, just come from Germany, where I saw nothing of this kind, I was disgusted at the appearance of these "slackers." I went up to them, and I said to the younger of the men, who was not much more than a youth, "You are a disgrace to us. If the country is invaded it will be owing to you." He had not a word to say in reply. Then I said to him, "Do you want work?" He answered, "Yes." I told him that I would give him work. Then the "gentleman" who was with him, and who told me that he was too old to work&#x2014;he was a younger man than I am&#x2014;came forward and said, "He cannot go to work for the Church Army; because what am I to do, and what is the misses to do?" I said, "I did not offer you work; I offered it to the young man." He remarked, "What am I to do then?" I said, "I do not know; go into the workhouse, I suppose." His reply was, "Workhouse. I am not going to the workhouse. Nothing of the kind for me." I ask you is not that the weakness of the country? Is not that one of the dangers we have to face? It is the moral danger, the slackness, the indiscipline which confronts us so seriously.<lb/>
If there was no question whatever of defence I should still support the noble and
<col>330</col>
gallant Field-Marshal from a social point of view. But I support him also from the military point of view as far as a layman can know and common-sense can see. We do not require advice from the two Front Benches because we know that to-day we are in a dangerous position. What is wanted, of course, is public opinion favourable to universal military training. We have to form public opinion. I do not blame the two Front Benches. They cannot go in front of public opinion; but we who are more or less independent intend to form that public opinion. The day will come when the young men on the Front Benches will eat their words, and we shall have that done which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal desires, or in the meantime we shall have suffered extinction.<lb/>
My Lords, I am not going to detain you longer. I shall only say this, that I believe, and I think you ought to believe, that this is a question of the very highest importance. I believe that military training will restore that credit to the nation which our distinguished ancestors held, and which I firmly believe we do not possess to the same extent as we did in the past. There will be lots of people who will deny this. It is what I have published in an article in the <i>Nineteenth Century and After</i>, and many people tell me I am wrong. But those who only turn their attention to sport will tell you that everything is not quite right even in that direction. I am thankful to the noble and gallant Field-Marshal for having brought this scheme before us, because, having it in the form of a Bill, we know that it is now within the realm of practical politics. What is more, the Bill can be studied by every man in the United Kingdom. I feel certain that the noble and gallant Earl does not bind himself to every single detail of the Bill, but the principle is there, and the principle will succeed. I support the Bill chiefly because I recognise that the discipline which will be given to our young men in the future will strengthen their <i>morale</i>, will render them a stronger, nobler, and more virile race than at present, a race more capable of worthily bearing that enormous, that almost overwhelming responsibility attaching to the citizenship of an Empire of 400 millions of people, an Empire the like of which the world has never seen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00718"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I once was a member of the National
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0169"/>
<col>331</col>
Service League. I admired the efforts of the League to educate the youth of this country in patriotism, and in self-sacrifice, and above all to learn its responsibility, but I overlooked the fact that the ultimate goal of the League was compulsion to serve. Of course I shall be told I have only my silly self to thank for such a mistake. That is so, but the fact remains that when my dull brain awoke and when I heard utterances in public places from responsible officers of the League detrimental to the welfare of the Territorial Army, I came to the conclusion that even if the lion and the lamb could lie down together the National Service League and the Territorial Army never could do so, and I resigned my membership. And for that reason, my Lords, and because, as it seems to me, this Bill is nothing more nor less than a vote of censure on the military policy of the Government, and because it reflects doubt upon the capability and knowledge of their military advisers I shall strenuously oppose, both by vote and voice, the passage of the measure through your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I contend that the Territorial Army is not only an accomplished fact, but a fact for which this country, and the people of this country, might well be very thankful. I further contend that the Bill of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal is unnecessary to the needs of this country, and, moreover, that its appearance at this particular juncture is most inopportune. If it could be proved that the Bill was necessary no one would stop for a single second to consider whether its appearance were opportune or inopportune. But what are the facts? What is the basis on which our Imperial Defence must rest? Surely the supremacy of our Navy. Surely that is a fact which is recognised by everybody, by all naval and military critics, by all experts alike, including the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. If that be so, what advantage is there if we turn every man in these islands into a soldier and lose our supremacy on the sea?<lb/>
But now, my Lords, what are our local wants? Surely we require a sufficient force to prevent a would-be invader with a small army and with a few hours, or even days, at his disposal, from attempting a landing on these shores. I contend that we have such a force. In my opinion my noble friend Lord Lucas has been
<col>332</col>
far too merciful to his questioners in this, matter. I would have him close with them once and for all with the contention that we are ready to meet all contingencies. In making that assertion I contend he would have the greater part of the best and most up-to-date military opinion behind him. Why not? Should the blow, which the National Service League tell us must fall, come when our Regular Army is at home, or should it fall when the striking force is away, we are ready to meet it.<lb/>
I personally, as an adjutant of Line and Militia for nearly ten years, and not so, very long ago, have trained more Infantry soldiers than probably most of your Lordships have done; and I assert that, with their little annual training up their sleeves, with the intelligence which is in their ranks, which no one will deny, with the driving force of hearth and home behind them, with the stiffening of Regular troops which they undoubtedly will have, and with the splendid organisation which Mr. Haldane is day by day making more perfect, the Infantry of the Territorial Army will do all that is asked of them. I will say nothing of the Artillery with my little knowledge of that arm, or the Cavalry, except to ask the noble and gallant Field-Marshal to remember those Auxiliary batteries from Canada and Australia which played no small part in crowning his reputation in South Africa, and the Irregular Horse&#x2014;Bethune's, Thornycroft's, and the like&#x2014;which gathered from here, there, and everywhere, and with so little training performed such gallant deeds.<lb/>
This Bill seeks to create a great compulsory force for home defence only. Is that supplying a national need, or is it a local selfish conception of which with our present-day talk of Empire we ought to be ashamed? In my opinion it is the latter. Of course it is lawful for us to talk about our local needs within these islands, but I doubt if it is expedient. Surely the Empire requires large Imperial Forces, prepared to take the field in a national emergency outside the portion of the Empire in which they are raised. It is to be hoped that a truer sense of the needs of the Empire will be arrived at when the Imperial Conference meets at the end of this month. Such a conception is not to be found in this Bill. Rather will it tend to hinder Imperial Defence, showing the Colonies how little we mean
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0170"/>
<col>333</col>
when we talk of Empire, and suggesting to their representatives that even our leading soldier fails to realise the situation when he suggests a remedy that goes so far from the root of the matter. If you were to bring the workmen of this country into this Chamber here&#x2014;now&#x2014;and put to them this question, "Will you consent to compulsory service, or will you give up your Indian Empire?" what would be their reply? I have no doubt they would say, "We do not know much about the Indian Empire or any other Empire, but we would give it up, whatever it is, sooner than consent to compulsory service." You say they would be wrong. Yes, and so far as Empire is concerned so do I, but you must remember they do not possess ancient coronets and musty title deeds; and, after all, education and the franchise are but recent events in the life of a nation.<lb/>
Do not hurry them. Patriotism a few years ago seemed to be almost dead, but with the advent of the Territorial Army, aye, and with the tuition of the National Service League, there are signs of a revival. Do not hurry it. Urge on the Government if you will to provide more training, but hang on to the voluntary principle as a valuable national asset. I read in the paper a few days ago that a noble Lord closely allied to a foreign potentate had taken German measles. That is a simple and childish complaint, but it carries with it, if neglected, grave complications. My Lords, do not neglect it. If you suspect that the gallant Field-Marshal is sickening for this complaint I would pray you consign him and all those who have come into contact with him to the isolation ward&#x2014;that ward which we on these Benches know so well; and I will carry comfort to them on the isolation in the words of a general officer on the active list, who, in distributing medals only a few days ago, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am delighted to see that this division, which comprises the whole of Wales and the four border counties, is 5,000 stronger this day than it was on the 1st January last. This is the expression of a free people that they intend to remain free, and I feel sure that in a very short time we shall have a Territorial Army worthy of this great land."</quote>
I concur with what the gallant officer said on that occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00719"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel quite unworthy to take
<col>334</col>
part in the debate to-night, because I do not for a moment pretend to the military knowledge displayed by some of the speakers. I will, however, offer a few remarks on behalf of the small minority of well under 300,000, out of a population of 40,000,000, who are trying very hard under adverse circumstances to take on the duty of home defence in this country. I have been in the Volunteers or the Yeomanry almost ever since I first went to school. I have followed the Yeomanry through the vicissitudes of the good old days of floods of champagne at the Judge's lodgings at Warwick, and the torrents of rain which never seemed to come down with half so much force as when the Yeomanry did their training on Salisbury Plain. There is not the slightest doubt that at the present moment there are far more men in the Yeomanry than we used to have, thanks to Mr. Haldane and better organisation, but it is exceedingly doubtful whether the men we have now, in spite of extra training, are very much more efficient than they used to be fifteen or twenty years ago.<lb/>
Not only that, but there is a very grave doubt as to whether a great many of them will enlist again. They might, or they might not. It is touch and go, because the pay has been whittled down to such a point that it becomes a very doubtful thing whether a man is going to get a fair remuneration for coming out with the Yeomanry. The country has got to such a state that it demands a man's patriotism and time for practically nothing at all. Observe, my Lords, that now the Yeomanry get no musketry allowance and no allowance for preliminary drills, while, in addition, there is this anomaly, that a serjeant who has just enlisted under the new rate of pay may get a less sum at the end of the training this year than a trooper under the old system. That I can assure your Lordships has caused a considerable amount of heart burning. The old scale of pay and the &#x00A3;5 horse allowance was the making of the force, and it was the irreducible minimum of pay by which you could persuade the best men of the country to come out with the Yeomanry.<lb/>
I do not think that the report of General Sir John French on the Territorial Force has yet been alluded to. I have been through it, and I do not think that it is particularly satisfactory reading. There is no doubt a general commendation of the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0171"/>
<col>335</col>
Territorial Force, but we also see references to the Supply and Transport Companies, to the question of the adjutants, to the immobility of the medical units, to the shortage of officers, and to some anxiety about the working of the system of horse supply under which the same horses are claimed by two or three regiments. The inaccessibility of existing ranges and the unfitness of a considerable proportion of the adjutants for their duties, together with one or two other matters, also come in for serious condemnation. I do not think, in the face of that report, your Lordships can be asked to accept the suggestion that His Majesty's military advisers really consider the Territorial Force at the present time to be an adequate force for the protection of the country.<lb/>
I know I shall lay myself open as a Territorial Officer to the charge of "crabbing," to use a colloquialism, the Territorial Army. But those who know anything about the Territorial Army at all, and who endeavour, notwithstanding their knowledge, to cover up its defects are not its real friends. There could be no greater calamity than for the responsible leaders of opinion in this country&#x2014;of whom I am not one&#x2014;to persuade the people that the Territorial Army is all right when it is not, and lull the public into a false sense of security.<lb/>
The Territorial Army has had every conceivable assistance that could be given to it. It has had every advantage in the matter of its "send-off" that could possibly be accorded to any scheme. I do not suppose anything was ever so much advertised. It has had all sorts of influence&#x2014;Royal, social, political and theatrical. It has had the benefit of influence in the King's Council Chamber at Buckingham Palace, and it has also been "boomed" in the half-penny Press, while a rather amusing burlesque, in which the foibles of the upper middle class are rather mercilessly exposed, has been performed in its honour. If the play to which I refer was worth anything at all, it was, I consider, an argument for national military training much more than for the Territorial Army.<lb/>
I always thought at the beginning of the movement that it was rather humorous to listen to the War Minister appealing to the patriotism of the country gentlemen. Of course, he got that patriotism. It was given cheerfully. They were very glad to give it, but in view of some of the legislation sub-
<col>336</col>
sequently produced the names of these country gentlemen will be handed down to posterity as those of men exercising some, if not all, of the higher Christian virtues. Yet in spite of all this influence and advertisement we have heard it from General French that the Territorial Army is still considerably deficient. Those who are rash enough to think there is a possibility of invasion have to struggle with the fact that the War Minister is not at all concerned about a "bolt from the blue," and that he thinks we are certain to have at least two, probably six, months to prepare the Territorial Army for fighting, practically in the presence of the enemy. That is one of the reasons why I cannot possibly vote for the Amendment of the noble Duke, and I do not think our own leaders really wish to endorse his view.<lb/>
I listened with great interest to the speech of the noble Duke, and it seemed to me that he was struggling with the most extraordinary adroitness with a very bad case indeed. Surely the remark about herding boys together at a certain age must apply to every institution where educational facilities of any sort are given&#x2014;to Sandhurst, Oxford, Cambridge, Eton, and the naval schools of the country. But the most extraordinary thing about the speech of the noble Duke&#x2014;of course I may have misunderstood him&#x2014;was that while first of all he attacked the scheme propounded by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, at the end of his speech he said, with equal candour, that he wished to renounce the War Minister and all his works. Taking the two phases of home defence, I am bound to say that if we are to adopt both together we shall be in a very parlous condition.<lb/>
I do not propose to go into the details of the scheme. As Lord Ampthill so truly remarked, what the friends of national military service want to see is the principle of the thing adopted by both the great political parties, or at any rate by one of the Front Benches of the Legislature. We say that we are only following what the Duke of Norfolk said in the House of Lords soon after his own Commission reported. The noble Duke said&#x2014;
<quote>"The breakdown of the voluntary system is in almost every case attributable essentially to the nature of the Volunteer system itself, which makes it impossible to demand a reasonable standard of efficiency without greatly reducing the force."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0172"/>
<col>337</col>
I do not command a Volunteer regiment, but I occupy a subordinate post in a Yeomanry regiment as a squadron leader, and I can assure your Lordships that the duties which are gradually being heaped on officers in the Yeomanry render it almost impossible to carry them out. So they have to go by the board. It is all very well to send an order down that not a shot is to be fired on the range without an officer being present, but with the kind of material you have to recruit from for officers of the Yeomanry you cannot get sufficient men of leisure to fulfil all the requirements of the War Office.<lb/>
We are told that we must accept the present system because the military advisers of His Majesty's Government do not consider the time is ripe for adopting the principle of universal military service. The Under-Secretary for War made a very powerful speech dissecting the scheme of the noble and gallant Earl, and also making a general statement against compulsory military training. But I was very much relieved to find at the end of a very powerful collection of remarks that he dismissed them by saying, "Of course, if it were really necessary," by which I suppose he meant if the electors became prepared for it, that would possibly do away with all the objections he had urged against the scheme.<lb/>
I do not envy in the future the task of noble Lords who so hotly oppose the ideas of Earl Roberts, because I am sanguine enough to believe the day is not far distant when the people of the country will wish to adopt universal military training, and should it fall to the lot of some of those who have so bitterly opposed the scheme to have to propose the system in the House of Lords I hope to be here to see them. We have been told about military advisers of the Crown being opposed to all this sort of thing, but if you will refer to the evidence before the Royal Commissioners you will find that Sir John French, at any rate, is not altogether so much opposed to compulsory military training as you might be led to think he is. He was asked this question:&#x2014;
<quote>"Do yon think that the requirements of a possible military situation can be satisfied short of general service&#x2014;that is, liability of everyone to serve?"</quote>
And his answer was&#x2014;
<quote>"No I do not think it can."</quote>
<col>338</col>
Then he was asked&#x2014;
<quote>"Q. Do you mean by general service liability to service for a couple of years on the part of everybody?&#x2014;A. Yes.</quote>
<quote>"Q. Conscription, in fact, for a period of two years?&#x2014;A. That is a thing I could not commit myself to. I have not thought sufficiently about it. I believe in the principle. I consider any body of troops, such as a battalion, must be together under strict military training and supervision for at least one year before you could expect them to have any chance of holding their own against an enemy in the field by themselves."</quote>
The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, said something about that amount of training being requisite. That cannot be taken as an argument against the scheme of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. I am not competent to pronounce an opinion about the length of training which is necessary, but the noble and gallant Field-Marshal I believe would have got even more support if he had made the period of training a little bit longer.<lb/>
I am very sorry to have to tell my leader that it will be impossible for me to follow him, though I have no doubt he will survive the news of my pronouncement. I do not speak on this subject because I pretend to have any military knowledge, but as a member of the Territorial Army I am conscious of the extra number of duties which I find myself increasingly unable to perform, not because I wish to spare myself in the matter, but because I do not see why the willing and patriotic should be asked to go on any longer performing tasks which the nation has no right to ask them to perform, simply in order to postpone the time when other people should be asked to undertake their share of the duty as well. It is because I wish to record my vote in favour of compulsory military training that I shall follow the noble and gallant Field-Marshal into the Lobby.</membercontribution></p>

One may sympathise, as I do, with the aspirations for the benefit of the people of this country at large which the Earl of Meath expressed and which he
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0173"/>
<col>339</col>
thinks likely to come from a change in the present system to compulsory service, without giving ones support to this Bill. But when I look at the provisions of this Bill I do not see that they, any more than the system which they are designed to supplant, would bring about the results which the noble Earl has at heart.<lb/>
I must attempt to answer the challenge of Lord Ampthill, who invited those noble Lords who oppose this Bill to do so on principle. I do that with the greater readiness, because I think the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War, with the powerful assistance of the noble Viscount opposite, who has held the post of Secretary of State for War, has completely disposed of the War Office and admininistrative side of this question. I should be the last man to question the authority of the noble and gallant Earl who brought in this Bill, but I think it is well to remember that the two representatives belonging to opposing parties in this House who have hitherto spoken, who have held high office in the administration of the Army, both take a view contrary to that which is taken by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal; and in so doing they have behind them authority which is at any rate historically very great, because they can quote in support of their opinions as against the principle of conscription no less authorities than the Duke of Wellington and Lord Hardinge, who, after Wellington, held the post of Commander-in-Chief in this country.<lb/>
It is also fair to say that military opinion even at the present day is by no means unanimous on this issue. But I agree with what the noble Lord opposite said that this is not a military question. It is not a question to be decided merely by military opinion. That would be a novel and unconstitutional doctrine to which surely no subscription would be made at this time of day. It is a national question in which all classes and all interests have a right to be consulted. Above all, Parliament should be supreme in a matter of this kind.<lb/>
But it seems to me the questions which the noble Lord put to the House are based on a fallacy. They are based on the procedure of isolating and ignoring all other circumstances from the consideration of
<col>340</col>
this one question of the duty or the absence of duty of a man to give national service. To withdraw from the purview of the whole matter all advantage or disadvantage to be derived from one course or another is to ignore all the necessities of the case, and to assume that under all circumstances the duty remains the same. That, I think, is an entire fallacy. Are there no other tests of national greatness? Is military superiority the only superiority between nations? Is there no competition between us and other nations in trade, or learning, or industries? It seems to me that these considerations are all absent from the mind of the noble Lord when he puts the simple question, Is national service a duty under all circumstances to be undertaken by every individual in this country?</membercontribution></p>

He assumes that this country can be invaded and is likely to be invaded. He goes on to assume that the duty of every citizen of this country is to accept compulsory military training. In the first place, I want to say that this is conscription. Noble Lords say "No, no," but it must be conscription for a few weeks or months if the system of this Bill were in operation. The element which distinguishes conscription from every other form of service is the element of compulsion, and compulsion is in this proposal. The noble Lord pointed to the injustice of the present system. Could there be anything more unjust than conscription by lot?</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0002P0I0174"/>
<col>341</col>
various names, sometimes national service and at other times compulsory volunteering&#x2014;the latter is rather a paradoxical description&#x2014;you have, as in all proposals which include the principle of compulsion, the essence of conscription. I believe myself that there is an invincible repugnance, on the part of the people of this country apply the element of compulsion. May I point out, in the first place, how great an interference it is with a man's personal liberty, with his occupation, and with his home, and his family. All these objections must be overcome before you will get the principle of compulsion accepted in this country.<lb/>
And when you regard not the individual but the community, how great must be the interference with trade, with commerce, with manufactures. No matter for what period your compulsion may be applied, it must interfere very much with the individual and the life of the community, and on that ground alone it is bound to encounter a very strong and a very deep-rooted opposition. The noble Lord says it is the only just system. His idea is that every man must give up a certain amount of his time to be trained as a soldier and therefore it is a just system. Are you asking from every man the same sacrifice? Is it the same to a man of leisure to give his time as to ask the workman not only to give his time but his labour? I do not believe the people will ever accept as a just system that which calls for such an unequal sacrifice and such unequal services from the different classes of the community.<lb/>
To my mind there are several reasons which must be held strongly as against this system, and I address myself to these points because I was invited to do so by the noble Lord opposite. It is assumed to be a duty that every citizen shall give national service. Then we are not to regard the necessities of the case? We are not to regard the material advantage or disadvantage to the nation of requiring such service from the individual? Every man is to devote some of the months of the year&#x2014;and possibly later on a longer time&#x2014;to his drill. Even if the lion were to lay down with the lamb, or the millennium were to be here, still this relentless national service must be carried out. It seems to me there is a confusion here of means with ends. The object of the Army and of the armaments generally of this country is to secure for the country national safety.
<col>342</col>
If that is done by other means short of requiring this universal national service it is none the less done freely, and the public of this country are to be the judges of the circumstances so as to know whether it is well done or not. You are to secure the country against invasion, and if the country is sufficiently secure, in the opinion of those who have the responsibility to judge of the matter, then the imagined general obligation of this kind of service disappears. It is the duty of the father to give meat to his children, and he may even have to beg bread for his children under some emergencies; but it is not therefore true that every father should necessarily be a beggar. You may just as well say every soldier is to be an Artilleryman as to say that under all circumstances every man is to undergo national service.<lb/>
There are other ways in which men may help to accumulate resources, no less important than the resources of money, which may go far to defend the nation. The leaders in industry, the men who build up great businesses, the men who make great scientific discoveries, the men who make great inventions&#x2014;gunpowder, steam engines and so forth&#x2014;have all contributed in a great degree to our national safety and greatness. In these ways men are discharging national services. Those who are so alert to hear the claims of soldiering might recollect other ways in which powerful contributions must be made to the strength of the country. There is our educational system to perfect. The training of a soldier and of every other class in the community is much simpler when you have a well-grounded intelligence to work upon. There are the conditions of life which are depopulating our country districts and overcrowding our city slums. To attack those, to do something to mitigate evils which proceed from those conditions, would surely be doing some national service; and I protest against the idea that there is no national service done except that which is done in uniform.<lb/>
Then let me deal with another objection which I think was suggested by the noble Earl, Lord Meath. We are reminded of the incidental advantages which come from a system of general military training. It is to train our hooligans, to inculcate the virtues of discipline and obedience, to reduce the numbers of the unemployed,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0175"/>
<col>343</col>
to improve the physique of the country, to arrest the physical deterioration by giving better food&#x2014;we all know how the recruit improves after some time in barracks&#x2014;and rational exercise. These are not only by-products; they are not only important enough to be considered byproducts; I think they are important enough to be considered as ends in themselves. But I may surely remind your Lordships that every young man of eighteen is not a hooligan, and that the seeds of physical deterioration are frequently sown long before the youth of the country reaches the age of eighteen. Nor will it, as I think my noble friend the Under-Secretary of State for War showed, cure the difficulties of the question of unemployment to keep men in barracks for six months.<lb/>
The truth is that these evils, which are great and urgent and should be attacked, ought to be attacked directly by other means. It is by the regulation of boy labour, by the establishment of a system of labour exchanges, by workmen's insurance, by physical drill in schools, and by facilities for athletics and gymnasia&#x2014;it is by those means that you will attack these evils much more directly and with much less cost than you will by establishing for that purpose a system of national training. The insistence upon conscription leaves out of sight as the remedy for these things&#x2014;I do not, of course, charge noble Lords with doing more than indicating that these are by-products of the system which it is sought to establish&#x2014;the real causes of these evils. It is the congregation of large populations in our cities, the divorce of the people from the land, unhealthy conditions of life and labour&#x2014;it is these things, far more than the absence of general military training, that are undermining the general physical condition of our country.<lb/>
One word on the question of invasion. The people of this country have never believed in the danger of invasion. I think if they had believed in it they would have made preparation long ago. But they know, as everybody knows&#x2014;and in support of which there is not absent both military and naval opinion&#x2014;that the landing of a considerable force on these shores is a protracted and difficult operation. I will not trouble your Lordships by going into so old a story. I will not even enumerate the
<col>344</col>
concatenation of circumstances which must take place before any such operation is possible. But it is a protracted operation, and it is difficult to believe that it could take place&#x2014;in fact, it could not possibly take place&#x2014;without the absence at any rate from Home waters of our Fleet, and it is difficult to see how those conditions could arise except after our sea-power for the time had been broken. And if you imagine this operation taking place when the power of the Navy had gone, it would be far simpler for an enemy, instead of risking so hazardous an operation as bringing over to this country 100,000 or 150,000 men and attempting to land them on these shores, and just as effective for him, to rest on what he had done, breaking the sea-power of this country and placing at hazard the food supply of the people of this country. His work would have been done, and no general conscription for home defence&#x2014;you might have 1,000,000 of men&#x2014;would help you one jot to feed the population of these islands.<lb/>
For all these reasons, my Lords, I cannot help thinking that on principle, as the noble Lord pointed out, and also on the military case which has been presented with such force by my noble friend Lord Midleton, it would be a serious injury to the defensive forces of the Crown at this moment if any action were taken by your Lordships' House which would throw doubt upon or which would arrest the working of a system which promises to place this country in a position of greater security than ever before. After all the wisest course for this, as for any country, after having sufficiently provided for its defences, is to husband its resources, to husband its finances, to develop to the full the mind and intelligence of the people within its borders, and to see that its foreign policy avoids provocative and irritating measures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00727"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this late hour I do not propose to follow the noble Lords who have spoken into the details that have been raised, but I should not like to give a silent vote on this occasion. I would therefore ask your Lordships to bear with me for a few moments while I explain the reasons why it will be impossible for me to support the Second Reading of this Bill. It may be presumptuous for a civilian to enter into a discussion of this kind, but we have to remember that, by the formation of the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0176"/>
<col>345</col>
Territorial Force, for the first time in the history of the Army the civilian element has been introduced, and the main reason why I cannot support the Second Reading of the Bill is that, having undertaken a somewhat responsible position in the formation of that Territorial Force, I do not feel myself justified in supporting any other scheme till that one has had a fair chance.<lb/>
I am quite ready to admit that the duty of the defence of the country is common to all. I am quite ready to admit that it should be the duty of us all to render our country impregnable to attack. I may also admit that the military experts as a rule unite in the opinion that the Territorial Force scheme is entirely inadequate for its purpose. At the same time, I think we have a right to claim on our side the military advisers of the present Government, because, as far as I know, they have made themselves responsible for this scheme. If they did not approve of it, of course it was very easy for them to resign. The critics very naturally fasten on the weak points of the scheme, which are obvious and regrettable, and which, with a little necessary assistance, I maintain can be rectified, but they entirely ignore anything that may be good in the scheme.<lb/>
What puzzles civilians generally is that whenever any Minister for War undertakes a scheme of Army reform all the other experts unite in denouncing it as unsatisfactory, and it is the Minister before who is almost always the bitterest critic of the attempt on the part of his successor at the War Office to deal with Army reform. I do not forget that when the noble and gallant Field-Marshal who has introduced this Bill was Commander-in-Chief the Duke of Bedford made a speech criticising the scheme with which the noble and gallant Earl was then identified, and if you will look back at what was said at that time you will find that almost the same criticisms were made against that scheme, with which Lord Roberts was identified, as are now made against this one. We were told that there was rubbish in the Army, rubbish in the Militia, and a great deal of rubbish in the Volunteers. I am glad to think that we have been able to get rid of a good deal of that rubbish. Then it was stated that we had a sham Army, a sham Militia, sham Volunteers, just as it is now said we have a sham Army, sham Special
<col>346</col>
Reserve, and sham Territorial Force. And I am convinced that, if this Bill became law to-morrow, the next day we should have the same experts denouncing it as compulsion which gave sham results.<lb/>
I do not see the great magic of the word "compulsion," and I do not understand why training which, under a voluntary system, is described as absurd, would be considered quite sufficient when under a compulsory system. With the exception of four months initial training there is less training in the proposal in this Bill than the great majority of the Territorial units receive under the present scheme. I think it was Mr. George Wyndham who said, at a meeting of the National Service League, that there could be no method without compulsion. That seems to be rather a strange statement to be made to any party of Englishmen. I have always understood that our system has been a. voluntary one from top to bottom. That, voluntary system, as I know, is appreciated, and has created a certain amount of envy on the part of other nations. We are now asked to break up the voluntary system and adopt a compulsory one. I do not argue that a compulsory system may not become necessary by and by, but why, in order to get the. principle admitted, should we read a second time a Bill which does not, I maintain, give us what we really want. We were told by the Duke of Norfolk that if we do overshoot the mark we should not do much harm. My own opnion would be that if we overshot the mark in this direction we may do a very considerable amount of harm. Personally I am quite ready to admit that the time may come when compulsory service, may be necessary.<lb/>
We were told, in a letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> to-day from Lord Newton, that-the proposal contained in this Bill is the only practical alternative to our present system. I wonder why. There seems to be a great deal of confusion between military training and military service, and I think the great majority of the country, who would be perfectly ready to support a system of universal compulsory training, would not be so ready to support a system of universal compulsory service. Though we are told that this is the only alternative, several proposals have been made by various gentlemen of more or less importance as to what our system should be. One of these gentlemen goes so far as to suggest that the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0177"/>
<col>347</col>
necessary continuous service to provide an efficient compulsory service force would be two years initial training. Personally, I think that would be much more likely to produce an effective force than that contained in the Bill. What are the two extremes? We have had the ideal soldier described to us as a man capable of meeting the best trained Continental troops. On the other hand, in order I suppose to discredit the Territorial Force, the men in that Force have been described as undisciplined rabble. We certainly do not contend that the Territorial Force may be of the ideal type; on the other hand, I am quite prepared to deny as strongly as I possibly can that they are undisciplined rabble. And we are asked to believe that this little difference of four months initial training proposed in this Bill is going to make the whole difference between efficiency and rabble.<lb/>
The noble and gallant Field-Marshal, speaking in your Lordships' House the other night, said, What is the good of asking us to double the numbers of the Territorial Force when we cannot even get the limited numbers that are now asked for? I should like to know on what authority he makes that statement. The time given for the completion of the Territorial Force was three years; and in two years more than three-fourths of the number required have been obtained. I maintain that that is a remarkable state of things, and I have not the slightest doubt that when the three years have elapsed it will be found that the Force is up to its full strength. In many counties in England the force is already up to its full establishment, and in my own county it is now not a question of "Will you join us?" but "May we join you?" There is a unit in Middlesex which is not quite up to its full strength. It has eighty per cent. but it has discontinued recruiting because it cannot provide the necessary instruction for the recruits that it already has.<lb/>
And that brings me to the question of training. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal, speaking in your Lordships' House on May 18, urged the necessity of having trained men, and he proceeded to quote the passage from Bacon&#x2014;
<quote>"Nay, number itself in armies importeth not much where the people is of weak courage; for, as Virgil saith, 'It never troubles the wolf how many the sheep be,'"</quote>
<col>348</col>
Unless there is something very much more definite and very much more continuous in the training that is suggested, I am certain that all we shall do by the proposal contained in this Bill will be to add to the numbers of the sheep. The main reason why I am unable to support this Bill is that I am confident that the amount of training suggested will not produce what we all want&#x2014;namely, a sufficient and efficient home defence force. There is another point in connection with that question. As I have said, one of the difficulties we have experienced is in providing sufficient instructors for the recruits we already have, and I think that before we make the great departure from the voluntary to the compulsory system we ought to have a much more reasoned estimate as to what the requirements of the country are. We ought to know how many men the military authorities are able to train at the commencement. Much depends on the number of competent instructors, the number of training grounds, and the accommodation available for continuous training both in winter and summer. I should extremely regret being a party to a departure from our voluntary system until we had information a good deal more definite.<lb/>
There is also the question as to the manner in which this enormous new force is proposed to be administered. As I understand, it is to be added to the Territorial Force. I want to know whether it is contemplated that the County Associations should continue to deal with the Force as they do at the present time. Their work is sufficiently hard even now, and if they are to have this great addition I think that a good many of them would be apt to complain. The only suggestion I make to the noble and gallant Field-Marshal is that while he is contemplating the introduction of a compulsory as against a voluntary system he should extend that compulsory system to the civilian side and compel the civilians also to do their share of the work.</membercontribution></p>

There is much to learn from our Colonies. The people of those Colonies generally go about their business with a seriousness of life and purpose that makes it worth while for us to study why they do the things that they undertake. They love freedom and exhibit a freedom in social and in political matters to which we are strangers because of our more conventional ways, and the fact that these people think it worth while to curtail the liberty of the individual in order that he may give his service to the State affords an object lesson which we cannot afford to ignore.<lb/>
It must be known to your Lordships that a Bill has been introduced in the Commonwealth of Australia for the purpose of bringing about pretty much the same kind of scheme as that suggested to us by the Bill of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. A study of that Bill&#x2014;I have a copy of it here&#x2014;reveals that a great deal of care has been taken with all its details, and it elaborates in a more plentiful manner than one would have expected many points that are treated with great simplicity in the Bill now before us. But the fact that these people have thought it worth while to do this is a lesson to us that the democracies of the world are not so opposed to the principle of conscription as might be imagined from some of the speeches that have been made in this House to-night.<lb/>
Some two years ago the then Premier of South Australia came to England. I am sorry to say he has since died. He was a democrat of the democrats, and while in this country he did me the honour of talking over with me his Bill for the promotion of compulsory service. He told me that the object he had in view was not only the safety of the Empire; he believed his Bill would contribute more than anything else to the well-being of those hooligans and troublesome men who were a constant pain and grief, and he thought that by bringing them into line with some direct service to the State there would be drawn out some better principles than had been previously exhibited by these men. It is just because I share that opinion that I am here tonight to support the Bill of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. Eight days ago I
<col>350</col>
heard one of our most distinguished Generals say that when he found himself at all oppressed with pessimistic thoughts about the future of our nation there was one thing that always encouraged him, and it was the spirit shown by the boys of the Church Lads' Brigade and the Boys' Brigade. He praised them very considerably. I believe I am in a position in some way to support that praise from knowledge of what these lads are, not only because I served on the governing body of the Church Lads' Brigade for a good many years but because year after year I used to camp out with them and see what effect the discipline of camp had on these lads. We never went into camp with a large body of new lads without some great anxiety as to how they would turn out, but. I never knew one of those camps end without our going away with admiration for the manner in which boys had acquired the spirit of discipline, thus proving that there was really mettle in them worthy of further treatment.<lb/>
The noble Duke rather struck terror to the hearts of a good many of us by his statement that the result of bringing together so many young men at a critical age would be practically to demoralise them. I have seen enough, I am glad to say, of the effect of a really good principle amongst lads and men to know that good is just as powerful in prevailing as evil, and to believe that in the long run good will prevail. I cannot help thinking that if the noble Duke could have seen the effect of camp discipline on some of those lads to whom I have referred he would be inclined to think that, after all, there is a great deal more to be said in favour of bringing together lads of all classes than he perhaps apprehended when he spoke tonight.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00732"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BATH AND WELLS</member><membercontribution>: No, it was the moral effect of the officers upon these lads, the good influences that they were able to exert, that made the lads change so very much and catch the spirit that they did. Such camp-life as the new recruits under this system would probably have to undergo would be of so strenuous and vigorous a character during the short time they would be under arms that there would not be much time for loafing and for that which was evil; and I cannot help thinking that the whole effect would be of the kind one would desire. Some, of course, would be likely to say that if the effect on lads is such as is described why not be content with that and simply give compulsory training to boys, letting men alone, being sure that in time you would have such a number of Volunteers in your Territorial and other forces that you could dispense with any further thought of conscription of any kind. But boys very soon get tired of a thing if they find they are obliged to do it, and if it were compulsory drill in the sense that our brigades were swept into State-managed cadet corps it would be very difficult to bring to bear on the lads all those good influences which are now brought to bear on them, and I am afraid that you would not find that at the end of the period of compulsory drill the boys would be very willing to volunteer. It happened at one time to be the duty of the battalion serjeant-major at Oxford to gather recruits for his Volunteer corps. That duty fell upon me at one time, and I know that it always seemed more difficult to get recruits who had been as boys obliged to drill in the schools to which they had belonged than it was to get recruits from young men who had come up from other schools, unless they were so impregnated with the life of soldiering that they wanted to do their best no matter what they had gone through before. Compulsory drill for boys does kill out a good deal of the love of soldiering which they have when they are allowed to enter into it in a free manner as at present.<lb/>
In the list of exemptions the noble Duke seemed to think it would be necessary to consider all sorts of people, among others the
<col>352</col>
conscientious objector. There are many things the conscientious objector might do besides fight if we had conscription. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland spoke about bakers' shops. There is that work and also the schoolmasters' work to do, and there are many employments which might be found for those who objected to being actual combatants. I cannot help thinking that though the exemptions may not have been very carefully drawn in all respects, it would be found that on most of these points they would work exceedingly well; and if this Bill is read a second time it will fortify us in the belief that here is a principle upon which we can act as a basis, altering it to fit the circumstances.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00758"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to ask the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies a Question of which I have given him private notice&#x2014;namely, whether it is true that the British and Russian representatives in Teheran notified the two leaders of the Persian Nationalist troops that should the advance of those troops be continued beyond a certain point intervention by the armed troops of Russia would take place; if so, what justification there was for interference in the internal affairs of Persia; what justification there was for His Majesty's Government in sending Mr. Churchill and Major Stokes to the Nationalist leaders asking them to stop their advance on Teheran; whether the attention of the Russian Government has been called to the inaccuracy in their Note of July 3 describing the Enzeli-Teheran road as "our" road, and whether such road is not under Persian jurisdiction; whether the occupation of Azerbaijan by Russian troops may not lead to complications with the Turkish Government; whether the Indian Government have made any representation in regard to the position in Persia, and if so whether such communication will be laid on the Table; and further, with reference to to-day's intelligence from Teheran, whether, in the event of the Constitutionalists occupying and maintaining order in Teheran, His Majesty's Government will invite the Russian Government to stay the further advance of their troops and not enter the city.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00759"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: The Russian and British representatives told the Nationalist leaders that the only way to avoid foreign intervention and to restore order was to give the Constitution as now re-established a fair chance. Mr. Churchill and Major Stokes were sent to the Nationalist leaders in the interests of peace and to avert any possible danger to foreign life and property in Teheran. There are still, it is believed, about 4,000 Russian troops at Tabriz, which were about to be withdrawn when the present movement by the Nationalists and Bakhtiari began. The noble Lord asks whether the attention of the Russian Government has been called to the inaccuracy in their Note of July 3 describing the Enzeli-Teheran road as "our" road. The statement is not in itself an inaccuracy. The
<col>356</col>
road was made by a Russian company with Russian money, and in that sense it is their road. It is not accurate to say that there is a Russian occupation of Azerbaijan. The Russian troops have been reinforced at Tabriz for a specific purpose, and will be withdrawn as soon as that purpose no longer requires their presence. We do not know of any reason why the Turkish Government should resent the presence of the Russian troops at Tabriz.

<title>NATIONAL SERVICE (TRAINING AND<lb/> HOME DEFENCE) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00762">Debate on the Amendment moved by the Duke of Northumberland to the Motion that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>, viz., to leave out all the words after "That" for the purpose of inserting the following Resolution: "This House fully recognises the need of a Home Army amply sufficient to secure the country against all risk from invasion, and the advantage of giving to as large a part of the population as possible a sound groundwork of military training, but it is not prepared to proceed further with a measure which, while involving unknown demands upon the national resources, would supersede the system accepted as sufficient by the military advisers of His Majesty's Government"; <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00763"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to give my support to the Motion for the Second Reading of this Bill I shall do my best to avoid trespassing unduly on the time of the House by going over ground already covered by previous speakers on the same side. And that will, I hope, be easier for me, because my point of view is in some respects rather different from that of many of the supporters of this measure. For one thing, my strong attachment to the principle of a citizen Army is independent of immediate apprehensions&#x2014;apprehensions of danger from a particular quarter, which are so prevalent at the present time. I felt it before those
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0182"/>
<col>357</col>
apprehensions arose. I should continue to feel it if they were, happily, dispelled. I regard the adoption of national training and service as the only means of removing a permanent weakness in our organisation, a permanent handicap, under which we labour, as compared not with one, but with all the great European nations who are our rivals. The effects of that handicap will, I believe, make themselves felt more and more, and that in many directions in which we do not as yet always recognise its influence. And they make themselves felt in the competitions of peace almost as much as they would in war.<lb/>
On that side of the question&#x2014;that is to say, on the great physical, moral, educational value of military training and discipline for the youth of the country&#x2014;I will not dwell at length, because it has already been so forcibly urged upon your Lordships. I will only say this. So strongly am I convinced of the value of such training, the benefits which it would confer on those who went through it, the improvement it would effect in the stamina and morale of the nation generally&#x2014;as it has done in the case of other nations&#x2014;that, even if we were never to have another war, I believe the country would be richly repaid for the expense of its adoption. But, while I hold that belief strongly myself, I fully admit that, as a matter of practical politics, a proposal like that of the noble and gallant Earl, or any other proposal on more or less similar lines, involving as it does, not only fresh expense, but a considerable change in the habits of the people, and in all our social and industrial arrangements, can never be adopted unless the nation is convinced that it is essential for national safety. Its indirect effects for good may be its most important effects, but its first introduction is only possible if public opinion is aroused to its direct necessity for purposes of defence.<lb/>
Now what is our contention on this point? Broadly speaking, and putting aside for the moment all technicalities and details, we rest our case on two main considerations. The first is that, looking at the position of this country and the Empire as a whole, having regard to all that we have got to defend, we need to be strong enough at home, in the United Kingdom, to defeat or deter any possible invading force, without having to retain any substantial portion of the Regular
<col>358</col>
Army for that purpose, and without crippling the Navy in the discharge of its main duties by turning it, or the bulk of it, into a sort of coast-guard of these islands. That is our first argument. And our second is that, in order to attain this degree of security at home we require a military force superior in numbers, in training, and in immediate readiness for use, to any that we can ever hope to get under the voluntary system. Any Member of this House who agrees with these two main propositions ought, I venture to think, to give a vote for the Second Reading of this Bill, even if he holds that it is capable of considerable improvement.<lb/>
I should like, my Lords, to say a few words on each of these, in my view fundamental, propositions. And first as to the necessity of having such a defensive force in these islands as to render invasion, even in the absence of the Regular Army, a hopeless enterprise. It is possible to believe in that necessity without holding that the invasion of these islands is the most likely form in which danger may first arise to our Empire. The idea of a sudden attack on the United Kingdom by some foreign Power, while we were otherwise disengaged, may not indeed be a chimera, for there is such a thing as picking a quarrel, and the experience of 1870 shows how rapidly war may spring up, even in the midst of profound peace. It may not be a chimera, but it is, I venture to think, a most unlikely contingency. And, in such a contingency, we should have the protection of the Navy, concentrated as it now is in European waters, and of the whole Expeditionary Force, which would still be in this country, to say nothing of the Territorial Army, which, especially in conjunction with a large body of Regulars, would certainly not be a negligible quantity.<lb/>
But the case would be very different if the whole Expeditionary Force had been called away to deal with some serious trouble in one of our distant possessions. And surely, my Lords, there are such dangers present to all our minds&#x2014;it is not necessary or desirable to specify them&#x2014; to meet which we should, or at any rate we ought to, send out all the fighting men we had got to send. But it is just at a time when we might have our hands full in some distant quarter of the Empire that European complications would be most likely to arise for us. The revolt of the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0183"/>
<col>359</col>
American Colonies was originally just such a local affair, yet before it was over we found ourselves embroiled with half Europe. And it will be within the recollection of many of your Lordships that there was more than one moment during the South African war when a repetition of that experience did not seem out of the question. And if a European war did come upon us, with the whole of our Expeditionary Force abroad, then certainly, under present conditions, an invasion, and an invasion in force, would become a very imminent danger. Would our Territorial Army as at present constituted be able to deal with it? The Secretary for War himself tells us that it would not, at least not till after it had been embodied for six months, and it is obvious to everyone that six months or even six weeks, might not be given to us. And all this applies equally to the case, perhaps not such a probable case, but certainly not a wholly improbable one, the case of a war breaking out in Europe itself, in which we might through our Treaty obligations, or by obligations of honour, become involved and be called upon to send our last available man to the assistance of a foreign ally.<lb/>
But it may be said we never should send the whole of our Expeditionary Force. I am afraid that is only too true. And that is just where the shoe pinches. The Expeditionary Force is small enough, in all conscience, for the work which it might any day be called upon to perform at a distance from these islands. But small as it is, should we ever venture to use the whole of it? One cannot but feel a doubt, and more than a doubt whether any Government would risk employing the whole fighting strength of our Regular Army abroad, if by so doing it exposed these islands to an attack which might be successful. Our military weakness at home, the insecurity of our base and the sense of that insecurity, will always hamper the free use of that Army for the purposes for which we ought to be in a position to employ it to the fullest possible extent. Yet it is absolutely in our power to put an end to that insecurity if we choose. We have only got to do what other nations do, and indeed much less than most other European nations. The advocates of universal military training are often told that they forget that this Kingdom is an Island Kingdom. But that is not at all the case. If these were not islands, the proposals of the Bill would be
<col>360</col>
quite inadequate. We do take into account the undoubted advantages of our insular position. What we contend is that our present system of national defence presumes too much upon these advantages.<lb/>
My Lords, I have been contending that the measure now proposed is necessary to set free the Regular Army for the discharge of its proper duties. The same is true, and even more true, of the Navy. No doubt the commonest form of objection to the creation of a strong Army for home defence is that it is a waste of money and effort, which had better be devoted to strengthening the Navy. My Lords, what we contend is that by adopting the measure now before the House we should be strengthening the Navy. You may strengthen the Navy in more ways than one. You may strengthen it by increasing the size of your fleets. The only objection to that is, that you cannot prevent other nations increasing the size of theirs <i>pari passu</i>, and so the relative position remains unaltered. Incidentally I may observe that this objection does not apply to the increase in our total strength, which would result from developing our latent military resources by training the manhood of the country to arms, for other great countries have already done this, and they are practically at the end of their tether in that direction.<lb/>
But to return to the Navy. I say you may strengthen it by adding to the size of the fleet, but you may also strengthen it for the discharge of those duties which it alone can perform by relieving it of responsibilities which can be placed on other shoulders. It may sound heretical, but personally I cannot admit that the primary duty of the Navy is to prevent any foreign enemy setting his foot on these islands. Invasion ought to be an unprofitable business in any case. And the Navy surely has enough to do without being expected to watch every shore on which an enemy could land, or to block every port from which he could sally. It seems to me it is not fair to the Navy, it is not giving it a chance of using its strength to the best advantage if in the discharge of its vast duties, including the duty of keeping open communications throughout the Empire and protecting our commerce, it is hampered and distracted by constant anxiety about the security of its base.<lb/>
The object of this Bill is to remove that anxiety. It has been argued that it does
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0184"/>
<col>361</col>
not effect that object, and even that it would not afford us any greater, or indeed as great, security as that afforded by the Territorial Army as at present constituted. My Lords, if that proposition could be established, the proposition, I mean, that we should be no better off under this Bill than under the present system, it would, of course, be fatal to the Bill. It might not be fatal to a belief in the principle of national service, but it would certainly put an end to the present proposals for giving effect to it. And so I naturally listened with close attention to the argument of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State in support of that proposition. But while the noble Lord undoubtedly made some good points against the Bill, and points to which in Committee most careful attention would have to be given, his attempt to compare the scheme of the Bill with the present system to the advantage of the latter seemed to me nothing but a brilliant piece of special pleading, only marred by the attempt to prove too much. I could not help feeling all the time what a pitiful expos&#x00E9; the same able advocate, with the same experts behind him, would have been able to make of the Territorial Army, if he had happened to be briefed on the other side.<lb/>
I do not think your Lordships, of whom so many are practical soldiers, would wish a civilian like myself to engage in a controversy about military details, but I should like to say this. The noble Lord in the opening of his speech tried to dissociate the noble and gallant Earl from the proposals of his own Bill. He tried to discredit it as only the Bill of the National Service League, a body, as his tone seemed to suggest, of irresponsible civilians. My Lords, the principles of civic duty and of patriotism, which are the mainsprings of the National Service League, are not the exclusive property of any profession however honourable. But we are not guilty of the levity of bringing forward practical proposals like these without careful consultations with military experts. Apart entirely from the high authority of the noble and gallant Earl, we have had the advice of soldiers, just as the noble Lord has, and of soldiers as able and experienced as the excellent men, and I should be the last to disparage their capacity, whose services he commands at the War Office. But doctors differ. Unfortunately it is not only always possible to quote military
<col>362</col>
expert against military expert, but it is often possible to quote the same military expert against himself. But it would not be fair to the National Service League to let it be supposed that it was acting in a matter of such gravity without much deliberation or without careful consultation of the most competent authorities.<lb/>
Some of the criticisms directed against this Bill seem to assume that we are absolute children! One noble Lord, speaking late last night took exception to our allowing only seventy-five non-commissioned officers for the training of 150,000 men. He failed to observe that it was seventy-five for every 1,000 of these 150,000 which we propose. It was, I think, the same noble Lord who made the remark that he could not see much difference between the Territorial Army under the present system and the same Army as we propose to recruit it, except the four months initial training. But, my Lords, that makes the whole difference. It is a fundamental point. We absolutely reject the idea that you can leave the serious training of the Home Defence Force to be begun when war breaks out. We do not want to pass any man into the Home Defence Force who has not had from four to six months initial training. That is our starting point, and, if we are told that that amount of training is of little value, then what becomes of the training of your Special Reserve? The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State said the 1,000,000 men whom the noble and gallant Earl declared to be necessary had disappeared in the present scheme, and that we are left with 400,000, or, so he makes out, 320,000, as against 315,000 under our present system. I should prefer even 320,000, every one of whom had had some substantial military training, to 315,000 of whom an indefinite number might have had virtually none at all.<lb/>
But it is not true to say that the million men have disappeared under this scheme. By the time it has been in operation for ten years there will be, besides the 400,000, or, if the noble Lord pleases, 320,000, men to be first embodied, 800,000 or 900,000 men in this country, all having had this substantial amount of training, all liable to service in case of need. The noble Lord says we have not provided for their rifles, ammunition, or equipment. That may be, and I think is, a good criticism of the estimate which has been circulated in
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0185"/>
<col>363</col>
explanation of this Bill. But it is no criticism of the Bill itself. The Bill provides for the training of these men and it provides for their liability to service. When the Bill is in full operation there will be nearer one and a half millions than one million trained men in this country, liable to service for home defence, capable, if they choose, of serving their country anywhere. It is impossible to blow away a fact like that as of no importance or to make out by any logical juggle that it is not a great advance upon the present position.<lb/>
It is said we shall have difficulty about officers. I know we shall. The officer difficulty is the greatest difficulty we have got to confront. But it is the greatest difficulty of every scheme. Is anyone prepared to say that it does not beset the present Territorial Army? As far as the present shortage of supply of Regular officers is concerned, I believe it can only be removed, or mitigated, by a revival of confidence in the Army as a career. Something has got to be done in any case to get over the existing feeling of distrust and make the career more attractive. If that is not done, we shall be in trouble any way, and if it is done, the comparatively small addition which the scheme involves to the number of our Regular officers will not, I think, be found seriously embarrassing. And as for the supply of non-professional officers, I think it is rendered a great deal easier by the adoption of the principle of general liability to service. Having to serve in any case there will be rather too many than too few men ready to devote the extra time, and take the extra trouble, necessary to qualify them to serve as officers. You will be able to insist on a high standard of qualification.<lb/>
My Lords, not to detain you too long, it seems to me that the improvement in our Home Defence Force, which would be effected by the Bill, is made up of two main factors&#x2014;the greatly increased number of men, and the thoroughness of the first grounding which they would all have received in military duties. I am the last to say that with regard to the question of the period of training, or to other essential details of a most intricate problem, we have, at this the first attempt, found a complete solution. What I do say is that when once you have crossed the real Rubicon, when once you have imposed
<col>364</col>
liability to service for home defence on every able-bodied man, you have broken the back of the problem, and the question of the proper period of training for men of the different arms, and all questions of organisation, will become infinitely easier of solution. For you will then have got over the radical difficulty of numbers, which is bound to undermine every scheme based on the voluntary principle. Once assured of an adequate number of men, you can afford to consider all questions of organisation with a sole regard to military efficiency. Under a voluntary system you cannot afford to do that. You are in constant danger of not getting the necessary number of recruits, and in order to make sure of reasonable numbers, you have to sacrifice efficiency at every turn. Does anybody suppose that the Secretary of State or the Army Council fixed fourteen days annual training, reducible to seven, because they thought it sufficient, or that they would not have preferred to fix a longer period. They fixed it because they thought it was the maximum they could ask if they were to get a sufficient number of men to make any sort of decent show at all. And I have no doubt they were right. And it is the same with all the other demands made upon the Territorial soldier. They are based on the principle of getting as much out of him as you can hope to get without driving him away.<lb/>
I trust that nothing that I have said will be regarded as said in any spirit of depreciation of the admirable work which has been done, either by the military authorities, or by the County Associations in connection with the Territorial Army, still less of the admirable zeal and patriotism shown by the members of that Force. Having regard to the weakness of the principle on which it is recruited, the attempt to create a National Army by persuasion&#x2014;you might just as well try to collect the National Revenue by persuasion&#x2014;I think it is perfectly wonderful how much has been achieved. I am sure there is no other country in the world in which it would have been possible. It is just because we can do so much more than any other people on the voluntary system that we go on trying to do impossibilities by it.<lb/>
In saying what I have done about the Territorial Army I think I faithfully
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0186"/>
<col>365</col>
represent the views of that large body of people who are represented by the National Service League. They are the last in the world to decry the work of Mr. Haldane, as he has given them at least the framework of a Home Army such as they desire to see. Neither have they, in fact, taken up a hostile attitude to the Territorial Army or failed to do their duty as good citizens in joining, or otherwise supporting it. On the contrary, some of those who have worked hardest for the Territorial Army are also out and out advocates of the principles of the League, and I have no doubt the success of that Army, such as it is, is due in a large measure to the vigour with which the propaganda in favour of National Service has been carried on in all parts of the country. Moreover in the continual struggle, which is certain to be waged in future between the enthusiasts of the Territorial Army trying to make that Force as efficient as possible, and the spirit of parsimony, dictated by political considerations, which, as soon as the present excitement on the subject has subsided, will begin to starve it&#x2014;in that struggle the Territorial Army will have no stouter allies than the followers of the noble and gallant Earl. But it is one thing to be willing, and, indeed, eager, to make the best of the system actually in existence, quite another to desist from pointing out its radical and incurable defects and trying to remove them. The Amendment of the noble Duke speaks of this Bill as trying to "supersede" the present system. The object of the Bill is not to supersede, but to underpin it.<lb/>
One word in conclusion on the question of expense. The Government profess to be terribly alarmed at the expense which the adoption of this scheme would involve. I do not think they can be quite serious in that. For as far as I can make out, from a careful study alike of the finance of this scheme and of the present Budget, it appears to me that the amount involved in Lord Roberts's proposals is just about equal to, and if anything a little less than, the amount which the Government are now trying to raise by taxation, over and above what is needed for our public expenditure. Well. Here is an excellent use for the extra money. The Government cannot pretend to think that it would be an intolerable burden to the taxpayers, since they are themselves proposing to impose it, just for fun. If we can so well afford
<col>366</col>
these extra millions, merely to supply the Government with pocket money, we surely can afford them for national defence. But, my Lords, even those of us who do not contemplate additional burdens on the taxpayer with equal gaiety, do I think feel this. We do not believe there is one man on either of the Front Benches who does not know in his heart that, great as has been the growth of national expenditure for defence in the last few years, we have not yet seen the end of it. Under whatever Government, in whatever form, that expenditure will go on increasing at any rate for many years to come. It is only a question of the comparative value of different forms of expenditure. Certainly there is no room for waste. If the cost of training the ordinary able-bodied citizen to arms is a waste of money, then it is just as unjustifiable to spend &#x00A3;500,000 on it as to spend five millions. But if we are right in holding that of all forms of expenditure on defence it is the cheapest, the form in which you get most for your money, and furthermore that it will stop a gap, will strengthen our system of national defence in that respect in which we are at present weakest, and will not only guard against invasion and scares of invasion, but will increase the striking power of our Regular Army, increase the mobility of our Navy, and give us a large reserve of trained men, then I say it is not four, and it is not eight millions which will be allowed to stand in the way of so great an addition to our national security.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00764"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help thinking that this is in more respects than one the most paradoxical discussion to which I have listened since I have been a Member of this House. The Bill itself appears to me to be something of a paradox, and it is supported, with the single exception of the noble Viscount who has just sat down, in a spirit of paradox by those who will, I assume, vote for its Second Reading. That is not of necessity to condemn the measure, but I think it may be worth while to point out the singular lack of logic which can be remarked both in the Bill itself and in the speeches of those who have spoken in support of it.<lb/>
This Bill is a Bill to abolish voluntary service in an important department of our national life, and to substitute compulsory service. I think it is probably true that in all other departments of civic activity
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0187"/>
<col>367</col>
noble Lords who will vote for the noble and gallant Field-Marshal's Bill would say they prefer the results of voluntary effort to those of State action. In other departments of life free service is given to the State and contributions are given to public objects, such as hospitals and charities of all kinds. In all these matters the noble Lords who are going to support the Bill uphold voluntary effort, and maintain that the interference of the State is mistaken. That is the first paradox. Coming to the second paradox, I take the Bill as it stands, and the speech and known opinions of my noble and gallant friend on the Cross Benches, not the speech of the noble Viscount who has just sat down, because his point of view, as he frankly himself admitted, differs in some material respects from that of others who have supported the Bill.<lb/>
This Bill then is, I take it, founded on the invasion theory which was promulgated by the noble and gallant Earl last year, which was discussed before the Defence Committee, and which was the subject of a debate in your Lordships' House last November. The Army which is to be created under this Bill is exactly the kind of army, whatever its merits may be on other grounds, which is the least suited to meet that particular theory of invasion which the noble and gallant Earl has put before us. Then, again, this Bill is to apply to Ireland. We have heard a great deal from the Benches opposite at various times about Irish disloyalty. So far it has not been attempted, except on a very small and tentative scale, to institute Irish Volunteers. This Bill will train, arm, and habituate to the use of arms the whole of that particular part of the Irish population which you are fond of describing as disloyal. That is the third paradox.<lb/>
Let us consider for a moment what the invasion theory of the noble and gallant Earl really is. Last night I ventured to interrupt the noble Viscount opposite because he seemed to me not to indicate quite accurately what our position was in regard to that matter. I understood him to say on this question of invasion that we were all upon something like common ground. That is not so. We do not agree that the noble and gallant Earl in bringing forward his suggestion as to the possibility of a sudden invasion by a very large force had proved his case. On the contrary, we
<col>368</col>
hold, and it is held not only by civilians but also unanimously by the military and naval advisers of the Crown, that the case which was put forward to prove that it was possible for a foreign Power to land, practically without any notice, a very large force&#x2014;150,000 or even more men&#x2014;had broken down in several important particulars.<lb/>
The noble Viscount who has just sat down spoke with great moderation on this question of invasion, and in a manner which I think cannot be altogether palatable to noble Lords who are supporting the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. My impression is that if they had to describe his speech they would apply to it that epithet which we all occasionally hear applied to our own speeches, and which we consider the most disparaging that can be applied&#x2014;namely, that it was statesmanlike. The noble Viscount who has just sat down considered that a sudden invasion, the bolt from the blue, was an improbable contingency, but he indicated the possibility of what might no doubt be a greater danger, that of an invasion in force at some time when the greater part of the strength of our Army was engaged in operations in a different part of the Empire. But in 1857 and again in 1900 we were in the position that the noble Viscount described&#x2014;that is to say, almost the whole strength of our Regular Forces was abroad and yet, whether owing to the good will of our neighbours, or the fact that they did not think the enterprise practicable, we were not attacked, and if we were not attacked we are entitled, I think, whatever we may think of the good will of other nations, of which we may hope in the future to receive the same measure as we have received in the past, to ascribe our immunity to the strength of the Navy.<lb/>
This question of invasion is to a very large degree a naval question. I entirely agree that we must not assume that the fighting Fleet is to be perpetually tied to these shores in order to prevent an enemy landing here. But that is not the same thing as to say that the Navy is not the principal machine for preventing invasion, and I think this can be shown by the fact that this particular demand for compulsory service on land has never been made by the responsible naval advisers of the Crown, so far as I know, under any Government
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0188"/>
<col>369</col>
and has not been made for the obvious and good reason that they know that if we are to be told that the Navy is not the prime defence against invasion and that a large sum must be spent on land defence, there is a prospect that the country will insist on taking some part of those funds out of the amount now spent on our naval services.<lb/>
Supposing that the theory of this very large hostile force arriving unexpectedly in this country is accepted, are the proposals of the Bill as they stand the best means of spending that amount of money for meeting that particular contingency? The proposal of the noble and gallant Earl seems to create a very large force of very partially trained men. That might be the right kind of force to create if you were looking forward to a long and rather irregular resistance of the type which our troops encountered in South Africa. But according to the noble Earl, what we have to meet is a <i>coup de main</i>, and the mere fact that you have got in the country a number of men who some years before had four months training would not, it seems to me, affect the success or failure of that <i>coup de main</i>, and that is why I call the Bill a paradox looking at it in connection with the well-known views of the noble and gallant Earl.<lb/>
What is the exact military value for this purpose of the man in his eighth or tenth year of this compulsory service who has had four months training in his first year and a fortnight's training for three years more? It has been said over and over again that it is the duty of every man to defend his country. And every time that observation has been made it has been received with the applause which an honourable platitude always commands. But in connection with compulsory service, if adopted in this country, several matters have to be borne in mind. It has been said with greater truth, I think, than can be generally found in an epigram that while an Englishman loves liberty and does not care for equality, a Frenchman loves equality but does not care for liberty. This scheme of compulsory service obviously infringes the liberty of the individual. I again remind noble Lords opposite that in all other arenas of activity they are for the voluntary as against compulsion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00768"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The most important form of compulsory public service which is demanded of the British citizen is that of serving upon a jury, and it is one which I believe is regarded as a bore by most of the citizens of the country. It is true that this principle of compulsory service enforces the principle of equality. I do not deny that the intensely democratic nature of this measure will cause it to have attractions for many, but the noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, pointed out in this connection some facts which seem to me to have no little force.<lb/>
I do not say that it is right or reasonable, but it is the fact that the ordinary British parent of the middle classes and also of what might be called the respectable working classes would not like the idea of their sons being put into camp for a period of some months with those whom they would consider the riff-raff of the country. I do not say that the feeling is a worthy one, but I do not think any noble Lord opposite will deny that it exists; and when one noble Lord said that after all this was what everybody had to go through at Eton and Sandhurst, he seemed to me to be travelling wide of the question, nor did the right reverend Prelate who spoke yesterday of the boys' camps at the seaside appear to me to touch this side of the question. The fusion of classes carried out in this sort of way is not a popular thing with any class in this country. Every one knows that there are a great many working men who dislike sending their children to particular Council schools because there they may have to sit on the same benches with those whom they describe as gutter children, and when it comes to fusion with this class somewhat later in life I think the difficulty will be found to be still more pronounced.<lb/>
The advantages of this training have been eloquently spoken of, and I am not concerned to deny that there are a great number of cases in which a lad may be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0189"/>
<col>371</col>
infinitely the better for training of this kind. My noble friend Lord Lucas pointed out that at any rate only half the nation would be affected, and the noble Viscount who has just sat down combated that argument on the ground that taking the average of the national physique it would be greatly improved by this training. But if you are to have forty-eight per cent. of exemptions and rejections, there will be a very great number of those who most need this training who will not get it. I think that is beyond dispute. Again, you must remember that you will catch practically the whole of the rural population, while you will get a smaller proportion of the urban population; and from the point of view of those who desire to see the younger generation of the rural population remaining on the land and settling down I do not think that this universal sweeping into your military net will do anything but operate somewhat adversely to that hope. The difficulty as to officers must multiply as you multiply your total numbers, more particularly if all this great reserve of men in the later period of their twelve years have to be formed into some sort of organisation and to have skilled officers ready to lead them if need should arise.<lb/>
I pass for a moment to the question of cost. I think that the controversy as to the estimate of &#x00A3;20,000,000 has been disposed of. When we named that sum it is quite true that we were speaking not of the proposals contained in this Bill, but of an Army of a million men, which is a different matter. The noble Viscount who has just spoken very good humouredly chaffed us about the large sum of money which we were supposed to have at our disposal, and said that a saving of &#x00A3;4,000,000 could not be better employed than in this way. I dispute that statement. If I wanted to spend &#x00A3;4,000,000 more on defence I should not spend it in this way. But when the noble Viscount talks about &#x00A3;4,000,000 I read his statement in connection with another in which, in almost an apologetic manner, he alluded to some of the proposals of the Bill, and spoke of them as Committee points. If it be a Committee point to substitute a longer term of service, which is very likely to be one of the points which he has in his mind, that obviously means a very great increase in the cost. Surely when the noble Viscount said, what I believe to be and regret to be true, that our expenditure on the Navy is
<col>372</col>
not likely to diminish in coming years, for reasons with which we are all acquainted, we return to the question whether this &#x00A3;4,000,000 of which Lord Ampthill speaks so lightheartedly could, even if the case is proved, be regarded as bearing a proper proportion to the necessary expenditure on the Navy.<lb/>
Yesterday afternoon my noble friend dwelt on the historical circumstances which have existed in connection with scares as to invasion in former years, and told us how in the early years of the Great War, when this theory of home defence was carried out in the fullest degree by the immense multiplication of Militia, the Regular Army certainly did not add to the glory of its annals. Your Lordships know very well how in the last years of that century millions of money and many thousands of men were wasted in inglorious campaigns in the West Indies and the Low Countries, until the honour of the Army was redeemed from something very like disgrace by Abercromby and Moore. There were other invasion scares in 1852 and in 1859. Anybody who will read the speech made by Lord Lyndhurst in initiating a debate just fifty years ago might imagine that it had been made in the course of this debate. A certain melancholy interest attaches to that debate because the Government reply was made by Lord Ripon, then Under-Secretary for War, whom we are all now lamenting. All the points which the noble and gallant Earl who has introduced this Bill urges were advanced by Lord Lyndhurst, who said also that the invention of steamships had entirely altered the conditions relating to invasion. Lord Lyndhurst went on to say that the national security could not be maintained unless there was in this country a sufficient force of Regular troops to meet an enemy who might land on these shores. There, I think, Lord Lyndhurst had the courage of his opinion, because he demanded Regular troops.<lb/>
If all the statements which we hear from time to time are true, what we really want is not military training of this kind, but a conscript army. Mr. Arnold-Forster, whose name, somewhat strangely I think, has not been mentioned in the course of this debate, was not prepared for a conscript army&#x2014;at least, I do not know that he was. But the proposals which I understand he favoured were for a short-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0190"/>
<col>373</col>
service army for home service and a long-service army for foreign service. That is a logical proposition. Its only defect, so far as I know, is that in the conditions of this country it is impossible to combine it with voluntary service. That army would be something very different indeed from the army or force which it is proposed to create by this Bill.<lb/>
Once more I find myself in agreement with the noble Duke who moved the Amendment. He said, and I think very truly, that you would not be able to stop here, that if you are to have a compulsory force sufficiently well trained to meet Regular troops who may land on your shores you must go a little further. You might draw a distinction between home and tropical service, and make your conscript troops liable, at any rate, for service on the continent of Europe. If you are to have universal service that is a proposal which I think will not unreasonably be pressed upon you. These are reasons why I assert that this Bill raises tremendous issues, which are obscured by all this talk about social advantages and boys' camps. The issue must be taken to be one between voluntary service and compulsory service, which I do not believe you will be able to limit. Therefore in giving our vote against this Bill we are giving it against the principle of compulsory service for this country.<lb/>
With regard to the Amendment, I do not know exactly what the noble Duke who moved it means in this connection by military training. I should prefer to see the Amendment somewhat amended for this reason. There is a tendency both in our schools and in the training of recruits to substitute in an increasing degree physical training for what is called military training. It is believed that Swedish exercises and exercises of that kind are of greater permanent advantage to recruits and to schoolboys than purely military training would be. To that extent I would rather see the Amendment modified.<lb/>
But in other respects I cordially agree that it is only fair to give a reasonable chance to the scheme of my right hon. friend. That scheme, sanctioned by the vote of your Lordships' House, has met with a greater measure of success than any military change which has been made in the memory of anybody now sitting in this House. It has only been in operation for
<col>374</col>
little more than a year, and it does seem unreasonable in the absence of any proved emergency, to ask your Lordships to register for all time an opinion that the scheme has broken down. If the scheme proves to be inadequate, change it if you will, spend more money upon it if you like; but do not, I beg you, embark lightheartedly upon the plan proposed in this Bill, which is by the admission of its advocates costly, which many people think would be infinitely more costly than those advocates are prepared to admit, and which at the same time does not, as I think we have shown, give any measure of real security against the particular danger which it proposes to meet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00769"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find myself in the somewhat unusual position of having to reply, not to any attack delivered from the opposite side of the House, but to some rather heavy batteries of artillery which were unmasked during the course of last night's engagement, and which have been supported this afternoon in a very telling manner in the eloquent speech delivered by the noble Viscount who now sits on the Cross Benches.<lb/>
There is one point in the attack about which, although it is a comparatively trivial point, I should like to say just one word. More than one noble Lord has taken exception to the fact that we had invited the presence of those noble Lords who generally act with us by means of an Opposition whip in the usual form, and Lord Ampthill in particular posed as a martyr suffering under the scourge of my noble friend Lord Waldegrave. I think my noble friend rather overrates the potency of a House of Lords' whip. I have never had the honour of a seat in the other House of Parliament, but I am under the impression that there a whip means a good deal, and that a member who is habitually refractory and disregards these intimations is very likely to experience a certain amount of inconvenience perhaps when he again seeks election.<lb/>
But my noble friend Lord Waldegrave has no such engines of oppression at his command, and really all we can do on occasions of this kind is to call the attention of our friends to the fact that a very important debate is going to take place and to intimate to them the line which we
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0191"/>
<col>375</col>
ourselves propose to take. Rightly or wrongly, that is the immemorial custom in this House. Lord Waldegrave can call up "spirits from the vasty deep"; sometimes they come, sometimes they don't, and when they do come they occasionally flit into the wrong Lobby. I go further&#x2014;I think there are one or two Members of this House&#x2014;it would be improper to name them&#x2014;who almost as a matter of principle disregard gentle intimations of that kind. I know one or two noble Lords who if they were asked the old question "Where shall wisdom be found, and where is the place of understanding?" would reply, we do not know exactly, but on no account look for it on either of the Front Benches. Well, we sent out this intimation because we do regard this debate as a very important one, and we think the Division to be taken this evening is one which may very seriously affect the position of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Perhaps I ought first to say what, in my opinion, our support of the noble Duke's Amendment does not imply. I say unhesitatingly, it does not imply any desire to snub or discourage the National Service League, with which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal is so honourably connected. On the contrary, I think every one of us recognises that a debt is due to the League on account of the successful efforts they have made to rouse in this country a feeling of patriotism and sense of civic duty. I can assure my noble and gallant friend, with whom I have so often been associated under different circumstances, that it gives me real pain to oppose any proposal made by him. But he does ask this House to take a very serious step. It has been said that, after all, this Bill cannot become law, and that we can therefore not do much harm by voting for it. I cannot accept that view. In my humble opinion, if your Lordships vote for the Second Reading of a Bill of this kind it means that you approve of it, and that you are ready, if the opportunity offers, to take it up yourselves; and I for one am not able to say that that is the manner in which I regard the measure on the Table.<lb/>
This Bill, remember, is not merely an attack upon the Territorial system instituted by Mr. Haldane; it is an affirmation
<col>376</col>
that the voluntary system has been tried in this country and has failed. It is an affirmation that we desire to substitute for that voluntary system a system based upon compulsion, and compulsion in the particular form in which we find it in the clauses of this Bill. And we are invited to do this at a time when a brand-new military system, introduced by a powerful Government, backed by one of the largest majorities we have known in the history of this country&#x2014;a system based upon an Act of Parliament, for which every one of your Lordships, unless I am mistaken, voted&#x2014;a measure which has been cordially supported throughout the country, and by no one more effectually and energetically than by Members of this House who hold the high office of Lord Lieutenant of their county, is still in the experimental stage. We are asked, while that system is on its trial, to take upon ourselves to say that it has failed, and that its failure has been demonstrated, and to ask the country to accept in lieu of it a wholly different system&#x2014;a system which, as I shall endeavour to show, is not in accordance with the Territorial system of Mr. Haldane, but which is described, and properly described, by representatives of the War Office as entirely antagonistic to it.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, my noble friend the Duke of Northumberland meets this Bill with an Amendment, about which a good deal has been said. That Amendment asks your Lordships to record an opinion that a Home Army of sufficient strength to resist invasion is indispensable, that a sound ground-work of military training for as large a part of the population as possible is a desirable thing, but it adds to that a refusal to inflict upon the country at this moment a new measure, admitted by its authors to be extremely costly, and intended to supersede the plan which is now upon its trial, which is believed by those responsible for its administration to be achieving an unexpected measure of success. I put it to your Lordships whether an Amendment which can be so described deserves to be characterised, as it was last night, by my noble friend Lord Ampthill, as equivocal, evasive, ignorant, and fatuous? Those were four epithets which I collected from a single sentence of his speech last night. May I venture as an old friend to suggest that those are not epithets which we usually apply to those with whom we act in political life, and it
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0192"/>
<col>377</col>
does not seem to me that his argument was very much strengthened by their use?<lb/>
I want at the outset to make two admissions. In the first place, I am not going to say anything to challenge the absolute right of the State to demand of every member of the community military service in any shape or form in which that service may be found to be necessary for the public welfare. I do not care whether it is military service at home or over-seas. In the next place, I am bound to say that I think my noble and gallant friend is correct when he tells us that the dislike with which compulsory service is now regarded in this country is much less than it was. I think that is due in great measure to the strenuous advocacy of my noble and gallant friend and those who act with him. I think, too, that more and more people are coming to hold the view expressed by Lord Meath last night and by Lord Milner this evening that what I might call the subsidiary advantages of military training &#x2014;its effect upon the character and physique of the people of this country&#x2014;are far more valuable than they used to be considered.<lb/>
I may be asked:&#x2014;"If that is your feeling, why do you not support the Bill on the Table?" I will give my answer with absolute, frankness. I do not believe public opinion in this country is ripe for such a change as we are asked to make, and I do not believe that the proper way to ripen it is to pass this Bill through the House of Lords. The enthusiasm exhibited at public meetings requires to be a good deal discounted. You have to reckon with a great deal of inarticulate opposition to compulsion. Compulsion to many people&#x2014;people perhaps who do not express their opinions very loudly&#x2014;is hateful, and I believe that if this Bill were to become law, and if it were to be studied and the attention of our people called to the heavy pains and penalties which are to be found in some of its provisions, there would be a very strong feeling of reaction against it, a feeling which in my belief might go very far to check the progress and impair the usefulness of the many measures which are now in force for the advancement of military efficiency in this country.<lb/>
Again, I entirely agree with the noble Earl Who leads the House in believing that it
<col>378</col>
would be an extremely serious thing to apply a measure of this kind to Ireland. Curiously enough the case of Ireland was never mentioned until the noble Earl mentioned it, but it is a serious obstacle in my view to the application of this Bill to other parts of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I venture to suggest that if a measure of this kind is to be seriously put forward it should be upon the responsibility and on the initiative of the Government of the day and of the people who will have not only to pass the Bill into law but to put it into operation when it has found its place upon the Statute Book.<lb/>
Something has been said on the question of the cost involved. Lord Ampthill treated that matter rather lightly. "What does it matter?" he said. I think it matters a great deal. I will not now pursue the controversy as to whether four millions or eight millions or twenty millions is to be the figure taken. But I am inclined, being an old War Office man, to back the War Office accountants, and I suspect that the eight millions of the Under-Secretary are nearer the mark than the four millions of the noble and gallant Earl. But whatever be the sum, of this I think we may be certain, that if it be taken for the purposes of this Bill out of the pockets of the taxpayers an attempt will be made to get some of it back by starving either the Regular Army or the Navy, and I for one should be very sorry to see that result.<lb/>
There is another by-product of this measure which I regard with the utmost apprehension. I mean its effect upon recruiting for the Regular Army. It seems to me impossible that a Bill of this kind should come into operation and not very seriously affect recruiting for the Regular Army. In what way it would do so may not be very easy to foretell, but that it would have an effect of that kind I for one have no doubt. But then what about its effect on the Territorial Force? The supporters of the noble and gallant Earl recommended this Bill to us on the ground that it fits in with the scheme of the Government and is calculated to promote the success of the Territorial system. I cannot believe that that is the case, and I must say that on a point of that kind I think we must to some extent at any rate defer to the opinion of those who invented the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0193"/>
<col>379</col>
Territorial system, and who are now carrying it into operation, and they tell us in the most unambiguous language that the adoption of this Bill, far from promoting the success of the Territorial system, far from being helpful to it, would on the contrary be destructive and injurious to that system.<lb/>
Then I cannot put on one side the statements made by the Under-Secretary last night when he told us that after all this measure would only increase by, I think, 7,000 men the number of those actually available for the purposes for which this force is required. Nor can I disregard his announcement that in the view of his military advisers these men would be trained in the wrong way, and that the General Staff altogether objected to the plan on which the Bill proceeds. That leads me to say one word with regard to the position of the military advisers of the Government. I entirely agree with what was said last night to the effect that it was very unfair to those military advisers to put upon them the whole responsibility for everything that is done by the War Office. It is quite true that they have to advise within certain limitations. I have no doubt a great many of them would be delighted to have compulsory military service and I daresay a great many of them would like to add twenty millions to the Army Estimates. But they have to cut their coat according to the cloth that is given to them. His Majesty's Government have, however, in this case gone out of their way to explain to us, not once, but many times, that what they are doing does satisfy and has the entire support of the General Staff and of the Army Council, and, therefore, I think my noble friend who moved the Amendment was within his right when he dwelt on the fact that we have reason to suppose that the military advisers of the Government are behind them in the fullest sense in the policy which they now favour.<lb/>
But I am led to ask myself whether, after all, putting these considerations on one side, this Bill really would give us that which the noble and gallant Earl and his friends are so anxious to obtain&#x2014;a strong Home Army available at a moment's notice for the purpose of repelling a powerful invasion. There are two contingencies we have to consider. There is the contingency
<col>380</col>
of invasion, and there is the other contingency of the supply of wastage in time of war. Let me say one word as to the contingency of invasion. I am not one of those who ridicule the idea that this country might be exposed to serious risk of invasion. I have never believed that there was such a thing as an out-and-out supporter of what is sometimes called the Blue Water school. And I make another admission. I am ready to admit that the risk of invasion is a risk which does not diminish but rather increases; that the conditions have changed in recent years and have changed to our disadvantage. We have no longer, I am sorry to say, the two-Power standard for our Navy. We know that the facilities for the concentration, for the ferrying over, and for the disembarkation of an expeditionary force are now much greater than they formerly were. And I am afraid I must add to that, that we are painfully conscious that the Regular Army of this country&#x2014;upon which in my view we shall always have to depend largely for opposing an invading force&#x2014;has been very considerably diminished during the last two or three years, and that that reduction of the Regular Army carries with it a corresponding reduction in the Reserve. Therefore I gladly associate myself with those who demand that we shall have an adequate and sufficient Army for home defence, as well as a Navy of unchallengeable superiority.<lb/>
But while I say that I am bound to add that I can never bring myself to believe that we are so absolutely and completely at the mercy of the invader as the noble and gallant Earl would have us believe, I observe that three conditions are always assumed&#x2014; (1) that the whole or virtually the whole of our Regular Army has gone abroad, (2) that our Fleet has been decoyed away or disabled, and (3) that the Territorial Force has not yet had time to undergo the training necessary to render it efficient. I find it difficult to believe that the whole of these conditions are likely to present themselves simultaneously at the very outbreak of a war. If I may sum up my view I would say that while I am ready to go the full length in insuring against all reasonable risks, I do not want to lay upon the country the burden of insuring against risks which do not seem to me to be reasonable. But I admit there is a great danger, particularly for a civilian, in endeavouring to treat these questions as
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0194"/>
<col>381</col>
general propositions. We are concerned, not with invasion in the abstract, but invasion by a particular Power and under particular circumstances. The Power may not always be the same and the circumstances may be different. We cannot deal with these matters across the Table of the House; and I therefore assume that these problems which, remember, are not military problems merely, but composite problems depending on naval as well as military considerations, have been thoroughly considered not only by the military, but by the naval advisers of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
We certainly have received from Ministers of the Crown distinct assurances that this is the case, and that they are themselves satisfied with the precautions that have been taken. Only a few months ago the Secretary of State for War, in introducing the Army Estimates in another place, explained to the House that under the directions of the General Staff the whole coast line of the country had been surveyed, that troops had been allocated so as to be ready to oppose a landing, and that besides that there was a central force which was to be despatched at a moment's notice, a force consisting partly of Territorial troops with a stiffening of Regulars, for the purpose of meeting and "overwhelming" the invader. Last night also the Under-Secretary gave us a general sketch of a somewhat similar plan which he said had been fully developed at the War Office for the purpose of dealing with an attack at the very out-break of war. We cannot, of course, conceal from ourselves that there is the vulnerable period of six months before the Territorial Force has undergone the necessary training when we shall be at our weakest; but are we to assume that during that period there will not be a ship of war of any kind near home to engage the invading flotilla and not a Regular battalion available to stiffen the Territorial Army? Both of these seem to me to be very extreme assumptions.<lb/>
But even if we are wrong on this point, would this Bill give us a Territorial Force sufficient by itself at the outbreak of war to cope with that invading force, which is variously estimated at between 70,000 and 150,000 men? Would it give us a force so efficient that it would release the Expeditionary Army from its liability to
<col>382</col>
remain at home? Would it give us a force so powerful and so well organized that we could afford to say to our Navy, "Depart for foreign waters; we shall depend for the security of these islands on the Territorial Army left behind"? I am by no means convinced that it would do anything of the kind, and I am bound to say that the speech of the Under-Secretary, to which we all listened with interest, made that abundantly clear. What is there in this Bill, or what is there that arises out of the Bill, to show that this larger force of Territorial troops which would be collected if the Bill became law would have any organisation, that it would be made up of fighting units ready to take the field? What is there to show how they are to be trained? What does the noble Lord the Under-Secretary tell us as to that? He says that it is the considered opinion of the General Staff that a force so trained will not be fit to set free the Expeditionary Force at the outbreak of a war, and a <i>fortiori</i> not fit to set free the Navy.<lb/>
Then there is the question of officers and of housing. I think that the Under-Secretary made an interesting point when he reminded the House that if these men were trained under canvas during the summer months you would be taking away 150,000 men at a time when the labour market was expanding, and sending them back to private life in the autumn when the labour market was a contracting market. This to my mind is a serious consideration. It is said that these are mere paltry details and that we need not occupy ourselves with them. Believe me, it is on points of detail of this kind that our military schemes get shipwrecked, and I am afraid that I see in this scheme a great many points on which it stands a fair chance of being shipwrecked.<lb/>
Then as to the effect which the Bill might have in enabling us to deal with the question of wastage in time of war. I confess that I am much more perturbed at the prospect of what might happen in the event of a prolonged war, and at the problem of how we should supply our Regular Army when it is employed away from this country, than I am by this other problem of the risk of invasion. We had painful experience of that at the time of the South African war. Our Army Reservists left nothing to be desired in
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0195"/>
<col>383</col>
point of quality, nothing to be desired in the manner in which they responded to the call made upon them. But in point of numbers they were miserably inadequate, and I confess that if I were Secretary of State for War I should be inclined to spend my last shilling in endeavouring to set what we call the Cardwellian Reserve fairly on its legs again. I regard some of the proposals of the Government with special dislike, because they must inevitably have the effect of diminishing the strength of that Reserve. I am afraid that we on this side of the House at any rate feel that the new Special Reservist is a very poor substitute for the old seven and five years man. What does the Bill of the noble and gallant Earl do to supply the needs of the country in the event of a prolonged war? It has been emphatically explained that this Bill carries with it no suspicion, however remote, of eventual liability to serve beyond the shores of this country. I am glad that is said, because I am sure that nothing would so much increase the suspicion with which the policy of the noble and gallant Earl is regarded as the idea that men were to be first compelled to serve in the Home Army and then afterwards to serve abroad.<lb/>
These are all considerations which render me unable to support my noble and gallant friend. I recognise, however, that his policy has one great advantage &#x2014;an advantage which appeals to me very much. It would have the effect of largely increasing the number of trained men in this country. That is a great advantage, because I am convinced that if you could induce a large part of the population to submit to military training, the men who have undergone that training will, when the emergency arises, come forward of their own accord. I ask myself whether, if, as I believe, the proposal of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal is not one which we can accept, there is no other way of attaining what he and I desire&#x2014;I mean a large increase in the number of men who have, at any rate, some rudimentary knowledge of the soldier's profession, men who might be called one-half or one-third manufacured soldiers. I venture to think that there is something to be done in this direction. I listened with great interest and approval to what was said on that point by Lord Meath last night. I believe that it should be possible as part of our system
<col>384</col>
of education to give to the whole of the boys of this country at school, and perhaps during the first year or two after they have left school, a certain amount of military training. Let us teach them discipline, how to hold themselves, how to use a rifle if we can. Depend upon it, a training of that kind would have incalculable advantages both from the military and from the civilian point of view. From the military point of view, because every man who had undergone this kind of training in his boyhood would be so much to the good when he came forward to serve his country in the field. But most of all, perhaps, from the social point of view. I believe there is a growing dissatisfaction in this country with the kind of education which we are giving to our boys in the elementary schools of the country. We teach them a great number of useless things, and we leave untaught a great many things which they might very well learn. I am afraid that our present system stands convicted of turning out a great many hobbledehoys who do not know how to dig, or how to fight, and who have very little idea of earning a decent livelihood.<lb/>
If your Lordships want evidence on that point I would ask you to consider the Report of the Committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture last year on the question of the teaching received by children in the elementary schools in agricultural districts, and I would also ask you to consider what is said in the Report of Lord George Hamilton's Commission on the Poor Law. There you will find a pronouncement, which would probably have been much more emphatic if it had not been desired to secure the unanimity of a large body of Commissioners, in favour of physical or military training as the corrective of a great many of the troubles from which society is now suffering in this country. And if you care to pursue your researches further I commend to you what will be found in the Appendix to that Report written by Mr. Cyril Jackson, who was specially deputed to inquire into the question of boy labour. Mr. Jackson establishes a connection between the question of unemployment and the uselessness of the teaching at present given in the schools, and he recommends that the teaching should be more practical and should include compulsory physical or military training, so that our youths may have a chance of
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0196"/>
<col>385</col>
something more than that kind of "blind alley" employment with which so many of them have to be content.<lb/>
I gather from what was said by the Leader of the House that he does not greatly differ from me on that point, although he would like to alter the wording of the Amendment so that it should refer, not to military, but to physical training. I am not very particular about the wording. What I am more concerned about is the substance, and I entreat the Government to consider whether by moving in the direction indicated they cannot do something to meet the views pressed upon them in connection with compulsory service. I believe that if the War Office and the Education Department would take up this question they would find that public opinion was entirely on their side. It has been moving in that direction and is moving in that direction at this moment. What else can we gather from the manner in which the Territorial system has been taken up all over the country? What else can we gather from the manner in which rifle clubs and boys' brigades are springing into existence?<lb/>
Is it impossible for His Majesty's Government to graft on to the Territorial scheme some excrescence of this kind? I certainly hope they will consider the matter. I ask them not to forget that when they first produced their Territorial scheme the Bill, as originally drafted, contained a clause enabling the Government to establish cadet corps in connection with the Territorial system; but, I suppose under pressure from those who regard all military training with suspicion, the clause was dropped. I ask now whether it would not be possible to resuscitate that clause. I believe that a moderate expenditure for purposes of this kind would do a great deal more for the physique of the lads of the country than any amount of fining them for smoking cigarettes. I think all these possibilities should be exhausted before we go to the length of agreeing to compulsion in any form. I cannot help believing that on foundations of that kind it might be possible to build up something, not, perhaps, reaching the ideals of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, but something in the nature of a "nation in arms." But if I am asked what I think of this Bill, I have to say frankly to your Lordships that I doubt very much whether it would increase the military
<col>386</col>
efficiency of this country, that I am very much afraid that if it were passed into law it might produce a very dangerous reaction, and that I am also very much afraid that by passing it your Lordships will not greatly add to the reputation of this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00770"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GRENFELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a late period in the debate and most of the arguments which I should naturally use in support of the Bill have been already used by previous speakers, much more capable than myself. But I think this discussion will be a great advantage in many ways, chiefly because it will clear the air and demonstrate to the public what exactly are the ideas of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal and of those who act with him. I am glad that in his speech and in the speech of my noble friend Lord Milner any sort of criticism or attack upon the Territorial scheme was deprecated. Anyone connected or having been connected with the Army must see and acknowledge that the organisation of the new force is an enormous improvement on anything we have ever had before. The energy and determination of the Secretary of State have captured the County Associations, and though many of those serving on County Associations like myself are critics of the scheme, yet every member of the County Associations is working hard and doing his level best to make this Territorial scheme the success which it deserves.<lb/>
I noticed in the description of the duties of the Territorial Force the Secretary of State and the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State did not quite agree. Lord Lucas told us yesterday that the duty of the Territorial Force in repelling invasion should be shared by the Army. The Secretary of State, in explaining the original scheme, said that the duty of the Territorial Force was to free the Army from remaining in these islands to fulfil the functions of home defence, and to permit greater freedom to the Navy. That is a very striking difference. If this Territorial Force is to fulfil the conditions imposed upon it by Mr. Haldane, very great care must be exercised. The large number of officers who are now wanted must be made up, and a much longer period of training must be arranged for. The Under-Secretary of State yesterday twitted the promoters of this Bill upon the fact that we were considering
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0197"/>
<col>387</col>
too much the defences of this island and not the question of offence&#x2014;that is to say, that we would spoil our Force by confining it merely to the defence of this island. And he spoke of "the ignominious panic of failure," confirmed no doubt by the author whom he quoted, which existed in 1805, just before the Battle of Trafalgar. But there was some reason for that panic. At that period Napoleon, with what he himself described as the finest army he had ever commanded&#x2014;the Army of Austerlitz&#x2014;was in force at Boulogne. His Admirals were engaged in making rafts for the invasion of this country, and I think the inhabitants of this island were justified in that panic. Was there not another reason in the fact that the defences of these islands had been neglected? The Under-Secretary of State also told us that we were neglecting Imperial defence for home defence. As regards Imperial defence, the safety of this island is the first necessity for any Imperial defence which is undertaken.<lb/>
I do not wish to enter into the financial part of this scheme, but I had the opportunity this morning of seeing and hearing those who made this scheme, and who had answered the last War Office criticism, and there is one item which is very difficult for us to understand. The whole of it has been gone over carefully and those connected with this scheme adhere entirely to their original statement. The item we want explained is the cost of the Territorial Force as regards their training. The whole calculation of this Army is based on the statement that each man in the Territorial Force is estimated to cost about &#x00A3;10 annually, of which &#x00A3;4 10s. goes to a fortnight's camp and hire of horses and &#x00A3;5 10s. to clothing, equipment, ranges, and buildings. Now we are told that in that &#x00A3;10 is included the cost for the staff. Added to that, we know not why, is the sum of &#x00A3;3,000,000. Our accountants have gone carefully into it and I mention it so that if Lord Lucas or any other noble Lord on the Governemnt side replies, I hope we shall be told why this is so framed.<lb/>
Various noble Lords have mentioned the want of officers, and we are now in a very critical time. A few years ago, when I was at the War Office, there were five or six applicants for every commission at Sandhurst, and, I believe, Woolwich. There are much fewer applicants now,
<col>388</col>
and those who enter those institutions I believe will enter them without a qualifying examination. I believe that one reason for the great deficiency of officers is the want of confidence on the part of parents and guardians of young men who might enter the Army, by reason of the reduction which has taken place and the reductions which we are told may take place in the future. Of the ten battalions that were reduced, two were serving under my command, and I cannot forget the dismay and the difficulties that those reductions caused. A large number of officers were cast out of their regiments; they waited for a long time attached to other regiments, and then they were placed with battalions who did not desire them and in which they did not wish to serve.<lb/>
The noble Duke who proposed the Amendment, was, I think, rather hard upon the reputation of the military forces. He mentioned that probably the moral influences of those forces would do great harm to those youths who would be attached to them. The noble Duke must be thinking of an Army of a different period. At present army life is one which the youth of the day can enter without any harm to himself, both as regards the officers and the men. I am certain that if the noble Duke could view more intimately the life which the British soldier lives in his battalion, he would say that those who joined any branch of the service would, instead of suffering any depreciation, receive advantages which would be of great value to them in after life.<lb/>
I wish to corroborate most strongly the statement of the noble and gallant Field. Marshal as to the advantages of the various boys' brigades and other semi-military institutions which are growing up. I have the honour to act as commandant of a large lads' brigade, and we heard last night the eloquent speech of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who pointed out the great advantages that accrued from service in those brigades to the lads in this country. Together with the noble and gallant Field Marshal I have noticed that every organisation of the sort is a success, and I think it is only a success if the semi-military element is attached to it. The particular corps of which I am commandant numbers 66,000. There is another brigade in which Lord Meath is interested, which numbers
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0198"/>
<col>389</col>
nearly as many. There are in all two or three hundred thousand, taking the various other organisations of these lads, coming under a sort of semi-military education, and I do not believe you would catch them or get this great moral influence over these lads but for the fact that there is a military organisation.<lb/>
I echo the words of the noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, whose excellent speech will have a very great effect upon this House. We sat on his Commission for many months; we examined many witnesses; and reluctant at first no doubt, as most of the members of that Committee were, to come to the conclusion which we eventually came to, in the end we came to the unanimous conclusion that no proper defence force could be obtained except by means of compulsion. You cannot get the officers and you cannot get the men. As an old Inspector-General of Recruiting, I am fully aware of the great difficulties which you have in obtaining recruits after a certain time. I fear that the Territorial Force when it arrives nearly at its maximum will experience very great difficulties in recruiting. I trust that this Bill may eventually, not now, perhaps, but in the future be passed and become law. Only by such a Bill or some system of compulsion can we ever obtain an adequate number of officers and men for the proper defence of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00771"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I want to ask Lord Crewe a question on a statement he made on the subject of invasion. He stated that the case of invasion which was put by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts before the Defence Committee, that the possibility of invasion by 150,000 men, had broken down in the evidence given before that Committee. I would like to call the noble Earl's attention to a statement made by Mr. Haldane in the House of Commons on the subject of invasion, to the following effect&#x2014;
<quote>"You would have to consider what was the size of the invading force. That is a problem you cannot answer with exactitude, but much investigation and consideration makes it pretty plain that somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 men is the force you must guard against by keeping your Home Defence Army sufficiently strong to prevent the enemy coming in large numbers."</quote>
I would ask the noble Earl if that statement is accepted by the Front Bench in this House?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00772"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I confess I do not see anything incompatible between what
<col>390</col>
I said and what my right hon. friend said. What I said just now was that the idea of an absolutely sudden invasion within a very limited number of hours by 150,000 men had not, in our opinion, been proved to be a possibility. If the noble Lord dislikes the word "broken down" I will change it for that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00773"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Then you accept the particular statement that 100,000 men could, at any given moment, invade this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00774"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: No, not in the least.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00775"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Then I do not know what to understand, because in one House the number of 70,000 to 100,000 is accepted as the number which could possibly execute an invasion, but here it is not accepted. And it becomes still more strange when we look at another statement made by another Minister, Lord Pentland, on the same subject. He said that the people of this country did not believe in invasion. Of course that is a matter of opinion. But he says that the landing of a considerable force on these shores would be a difficult operation, and it was difficult to see how the necessary conditions could arise unless our sea-power had been broken. It is necessary to arrive at the real opinion of the Government on this point, because the defence of this country must. Obviously depend upon two questions&#x2014;first, on the number of invaders from abroad; and, second, on the number of defenders we have at home. We have tried to get the opinion of the Government on either question and as yet we have signally failed.<lb/>
The reason, I think, a good many on this side of the House are supporting the Bill, although many do not agree with it in all its particulars, is that we feel that we want more definite information about the military situation of England to-day. We have had from both Front Benches in this House a great deal of criticism of detail, but we have failed to get any statements as to whether the total number of men is or is not sufficient. But this total number of men is a matter of the first importance. First of all, with regard to the Expeditionary Force, as far as one can learn from the statements of noble Lords opposite the Expeditionary Force can only sail at all under a series of hypotheses. It is admitted that only a portion of the force can go abroad, because the Territorial Army have to wait for the period of training
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0199"/>
<col>391</col>
before they can take over the defence of the country. If a crisis arose in India another Power might give indication that an invasion was possible, although there might be on the surface friendly relations between us. That would put us in the position, as Lord Newton says, of having our Expeditionary Force mobilised and ready to sail, yet by inadequacy of home defence "tied like a goat" to these shores. I do not know if that is regarded as a satisfactory condition.<lb/>
We have, according to Lord Crewe, the possibility of invasion by a number not absolutely decided. We have individual opinions by Members of the other House as to the possibility of an invasion by 100,000 men. Let us see what we have to put against them if the Expeditionary Force is over-seas. We have, according to Lord Lucas, 101 battalions mobilised yet immobile, consisting of the relics of half-drilled boy Regulars, Reservists unfit for active service, and Special Reserve. After the wants of the fixed defences had been satisfied we would have to depend for our central force upon the Territorial Army. I ventured to prove with figures the other day that we could not get for this force, on whom the brunt of the fighting would fall, 100,000 men. But suppose I am wrong and we could actually get 200,000, would that be sufficient to meet the number of troops that Mr. Haldane has admitted are able to come across? It is stated here that, even with four months training, these men would not be equal to men trained on the Continent. I agree, but how much less so will they be if they have not had this four months training at all?<lb/>
May I compare for a moment the training which a man would get under Lord Roberts's scheme and the average training of the Territorial Army to-day A certain portion of the Territorial Army camp out for fourteen days and others for seven days. Look for a moment how those fourteen days are spent. One day for going into camp, one day for coming out; no work is ever done in those two days from a military point of view. Then there are two Sundays, which makes four days, and one afternoon for regimental sports. Then from the fact that these men join every year you have to brush up a certain number of recruits, and the first three or four days are taken up with preliminary drills and those exercises which cannot be got through at other times. The
<col>392</col>
result is that the commanding officer and the other senior officers of the unit only have three or four opportunities a year of training men in any numbers. Compare that with the conditions under the noble and gallant Field-Marshal's scheme. These men would come into the Territorial Army on the same day. There would be no waiting for casual recruits, and, still less, waiting for those seven days men who come in after the camp has been opened and go out before it is over and confuse the whole thing. Compare the results which you would arrive at with these two methods of training. I think no one would deny that under the noble and gallant Field-Marshal's scheme you would get a very much more efficient force. It is over the question of numbers that I regret I am unable to agree with what has been put forward by either of the Front Benches. I think that we are not within 300,000 men of adequate home defence, and this constitutes a definite danger. I do not say if we sent our Expeditionary Force away we are 300,000 men short. If our Expeditionary Force stays here, of course, we shall not be invaded; but then if our Expeditionary Force cannot expedition we must abandon the idea of defending our Colonies or of being a world-Power at all.<lb/>
Frankly, I do not like this Bill. I do not think it is a good Bill. In the first place it is a mistake to take men to train as early as eighteen years. What is wanted is to be ready for immediate action, and the men should be taken at a time when they would be fit immediately to take the field. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State asked, in a previous debate, what was the difference for home defence between a man of eighteen and one of twenty years of age? There is a great difference. At twenty they are men and can carry a man's burden. The troops who would come over here would be men of twenty-one years of age and over; they would all carry three days rations and part of their tent and cooking utensils. That may seem a detail, but that gives the General commanding the Force something like three days away from his supplies, and that, <i>c&#x0153;teris paribus</i>, might make the difference between victory and defeat. There are other points I do not care for in the noble and gallant Field-Marshal's Bill. If we are going to abandon the whole idea of voluntary service, I would like to see a Bill which would give
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0200"/>
<col>393</col>
longer training and provide for a greater length of training for officers and noncommissioned officers.<lb/>
On the other hand there are many points in Lord Roberts's Bill which get us out of our difficulties. He gets over the question of officers. If you have compulsion you can always compel officers to go into training before they come into camp which would render them efficient. At present they come into a volunteer force totally inefficient; they are bundled out with men who know very little themselves, and the result is that your junior officers of the Territorial Army are not nearly up to the standard they ought to be. Once you get conscription or compulsion&#x2014;I do not see much difference between the two terms&#x2014;you can say to a man when he joins, "Unless you are qualified, either by your University or public school course, or otherwise, to command men, in you go into the ranks." And, as has been found in France and Germany, this has acted as a deterrent, and officers have, by passing examinations, fully qualified themselves to command troops.<lb/>
There is another thing I like about Lord Roberts's scheme. He supports Territorial principles which Mr. Haldane has put forward. I do not think anyone can overestimate the magnificent work for the country which Mr. Haldane has done, and the splendid organisation he has established; and anything which progresses on the lines Mr. Haldane has laid down must be on the right lines. We have altered our schemes so often that we do wish for continuity as far as it can be obtained. It has very often been asked, What is the difference between four months continual training and that amount of training dotted about during a year? There is first, and most important of all, discipline. If men are together in camp for four months they very soon get to know that an order given has to be obeyed. There is no "please" at the end when an order is given, but it is carried out instantly; and when you get Regular officers, as there would be under Lord Roberts's scheme, at the head of the training of the regiments you would get discipline maintained, and the junior officers, knowing what discipline is, would keep it up themselves. If the principle of voluntary service could be followed. I would follow it, but I regard the question
<col>394</col>
of the safety of this country and of remaining a world-wide Power before any personal predilection for voluntary as opposed to compulsory service, and for that reason I shall follow the noble and gallant Earl into the Lobby.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00776"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask the Government if it is really impossible for them to tell us the precise purpose for which their Territorial Army is designed. Let me remind your Lordships of the many and various uses which in the imagination of its creators the Territorial Force during its very brief existence has already served. In December, 1907, the Secretary of State for War, speaking in Staffordshire, is reported to have given the warning that&#x2014;
<quote>"We may not be able in days to come to depend wholly and absolutely upon our Navy with the completeness of to-day, and should that time arrive, it would be upon the Home Defence Force that we should have to rest our trust."</quote>
How on earth the Territorial Army can retrieve a disaster on the high seas is a point for the Government to explain. However, two years ago, in order to reconcile the country to the great changes and sacrifices we were called upon to make for the sake of the new Home Defence Army, it was necessary first to convince public opinion that too much reliance should not be placed upon the Navy, and, moreover, that in the event of any naval failure, the situation could be retrieved by the proposed new Territorial Force.<lb/>
Two years elapse, and in that interval we see the Regular Army and the Regular Reserve diminished by more than 40,000 men, the Militia abolished, the attempt made to substitute for the reductions in the Regular Reserve a new Force, the Special Reserve, and it is upon the uncertain result of this experiment that the future of the Regular Army depends; finally, the abolition of the Volunteers, and the appearance of the Territorial Army&#x2014;a Force confined by Act of Parliament to the United Kingdom, but limited in its recruiting area to Great Britain, and, unlike the old Militia which it replaced, incapable of recruitment by compulsion. Then on January 28, 1909, the First Lord of the Admiralty announced that the Navy was to be maintained&#x2014;
<quote>"at such strength as would secure, beyond question or doubt, our shores from invasion and the freedom of the great highway of the sea."</quote>
That announcement destroyed for the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0201"/>
<col>395</col>
moment the perilous situation pictured by the Secretary of State for War, which he had met by creating a new purely Home Defence Force but at the expense of the Regular Army reduced.<lb/>
The view of national defence expounded in 1907 by the Secretary of State for War cannot be reconciled with that held last January by the First Lord of the Admiralty. It is, therefore, not surprising to find the Admiralty and the Army Council at loggerheads over the details of national defence. We know the naval view&#x2014;namely, that the Navy can prevent the landing of 3,000 men with just as great a certainty as they can prevent the landing of 300,000 men. To their view of invasion the Admiralty has given practical effect as follows. When they took over the charge of our submarine defences, which had been brought at great cost to a pitch of elaborate perfection by the Royal Engineers, they destroyed them all, because from the naval point of view of national defence they were useless. Then at our naval bases, such as Portsmouth and Plymouth and Chatham, the landward forts are maintained by the Army Council for the purpose of defending our great dockyards from attacks coming over land. But in deference to the Admiralty view these forts have been dismantled of their permanent armament. In the end we find the Army Council allotting on mobilisation half-trained units of the Territorial Force to garrison forts from which the fixed armament has been removed in order to resist attacks, which, according to the Admiralty, are impossible. On the other hand, if the Army Council is right and the Admiralty is wrong, then the present condition of the great dockyard towns is an intolerable danger. If the Army Council is right and our great dockyards are likely to be attacked from the land side, then they ought to be made secure. This cannot be done by first depriving the landward forts of their permanent armament and then attempting to defend the whole fortress by a semi-trained field force armed with an antiquated mobile equipment.<lb/>
Nor is the Territorial Army a mystery to the Admiralty alone. I note with interest but not surprise that distinguished Generals on the active list have arrived at opposite conclusions regarding its use in war. Last October General Baden-Powell lectured at the Royal United Services Institution on "Training for Territorials," with the Secretary of State for
<col>396</col>
War in the chair. The Territorial soldier was held to be beyond all question a First Line man. In view of that fact, the problem considered was how to ensure that the Territorial Infantry should after the inside of a week's work in camp be able to defeat at a moment's warning the very best Continental troops, because it is certain that these are the only description of troops against which the Territorial Army can ever be employed. The solution arrived at was to give the Territorial companies when in camp a course of "battle practice," but to dispense with all other training, no time being available. I understand that "battle practice" means that every man fights his own battle on his own plan. In the new model Army of the Government every man will be his own commanding officer when in action, thus solving the problem of the dearth of officers by providing a positive plethora. But I am not now concerned with the question of officers.<lb/>
My point is that the Territorial soldier was held by certain distinguished military authorities to be so essentially a First Line man, and required for battle in such a terrible hurry, that he has not even time to learn during his annual training the elements of drill, discipline, and musketry, the practice of such antiquated military details being relegated to odd moments during the non-training period. Then comes the Inspector-General of the Forces, Sir John French, who tells us that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial Army is now the Second Line of the great national Army, and the only difference between the Second Line and the First Line is that whereas the former has to meet the first onslaught of war and is therefore continually employed, the Second Line has to meet the waste of war and to furnish reinforcements after the war has gone on for some time and to begin its training after the war has broken out."</quote>
It is clear from these words that Sir John French considers the use of the Territorial Force to be to supply drafts to the Regular Army during the progress of a lengthy campaign, and a lengthy campaign can only take place abroad. This view quite agrees with that expressed by the Secretary of State for War in July, 1906, when the right hon. gentleman said&#x2014;
<quote>"Some of them [the Volunteers or Territorial Army] would have to form that big national Reserve out of which an Army must be fed and expanded when the great emergencies come in a national crisis."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0202"/>
<col>397</col>
But it is for home service only that the Government have enlisted the Territorial Army. They cannot, therefore, send the men abroad without their own consent. For my own part I have always disliked the plan of enlisting men for one service and then, at a moment of national crisis, when refusal is practically impossible, asking them to volunteer for another. Such a form of volunteering contains more than a spice of compulsion. It is well described by that very able exponent of the new model Army of the Government, the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, in a lecture delivered before the Aldershot Military Society. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"Imagine the Regular Army at grips with a formidable enemy abroad. Imagine fourteen strong Territorial divisions of all arms embodied at home and trained continuously up to the point of efficiency. Imagine an appeal to them to succour the Regular Army in its need. If the Territorial Army should be deaf to that appeal the only resource will be to shut them up in our gaols, for nowhere else will they be safe from their women-kind and from the insults of the infants of the streets."</quote>
The Territorial Force describe themselves as Home Guards serving <i>Pro aris et focis</i>. The Army Council think that with the aid of a national crisis they can easily make that motto read <i>Ubique</i>. I infer that the Territorial Force and the Army Council do not exactly understand each other on this most important of points&#x2014;namely, foreign service for the Second Line Army in place of the Militia abolished. It is true that the Government has very distinctly told the Territorial Army that they are to be our only Second Line and consequently to discharge all the duties of the defunct Militia, the most important of which was the expansion of the Regular Army overseas. It is idle for the Government to expect us to believe that their new model Second Line Army in any way carries out the recommendation of the Royal Commission concerning the expansion of the Regular Army. All they have done for Imperial defence is to reduce the Regular Army and Reserve by 40,000 men, and then to rely on the casual volunteering of men to perform exacting duties from which they have expressly contracted to be free. As a matter of fact, it is impossible for the General Staff or for the Imperial Staff or for any other Staff of honest men to work out even the simplest schemes of expansion of the Army abroad when there is no certainty of the number of regiments and battalions and batteries which will volunteer
<col>398</col>
for foreign service or of the number of men in any one unit who will do so.<lb/>
It is, of course, from the Volunteers that the Territorial Infantry has been formed. As to their capacity to undertake foreign service, let me quote the opinion of the Director-General of the Territorial Army. In his evidence before the Royal Commission, General Mackinnon was of opinion that&#x2014;
<quote>"The whole of the Volunteers of London could not be relied upon to provide more than two regiments for a foreign war."</quote>
I believe that when that view was expressed there were about 35,000 Volunteers in London. An attempt was made in 1900 to establish Volunteer Service Companies &#x2014;that is, a company in each Regiment who would agree to serve abroad in time of war. But, according to Sir Alfred Turner's evidence before the War Commission, the scheme was abandoned owing mainly to the opposition of the Volunteers themselves. An enrolled Volunteer so long as he was a member of that Force was not allowed by the Volunteer Acts to serve outside Great Britain. Thus he was absolutely protected from every form of compulsory volunteering for service abroad. So long as he served under the Volunteer Act he could never find himself, as the Territorial soldier will find himself, in the position of belonging to a battalion which on parade is called upon by its commanding officer in time of national emergency to volunteer for foreign service, and all men not willing to do so ordered to fall out on the reverse flank. It seems to me that you must restore to the Territorial soldiers the same protection against foreign service which was accorded to the Volunteers by Act of Parliament before recruiting the Second Line by compulsory methods. The Bill places no liability for foreign service upon Territorial soldiers, but it does not confer any immunity similar to that given by the Volunteer Act to members of that Force.<lb/>
In considering universal compulsory military service for the Territorial Army it is only fair to remember the greatly increased liabilities which must devolve in time of war upon the soldiers of the new Second Line in comparison with those of the Volunteers of the old Third Line. It is true that the peace training of the Territorial soldier is even less exacting
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0203"/>
<col>399</col>
than was that of the Volunteers. That is due to a notable discovery recently made by the Army Council&#x2014;namely, that a few Saturday afternoons, Easter Sunday, Good Friday, and a Bank Holiday or two, with a week-end or so in a seaside camp&#x2014;in short, precisely the amount of time which patriotic civilians striving to earn their daily bread can spare for military training&#x2014;will suffice to convert them into soldiers so sure to beat the pick of Continental troops that the Regular Army may be safely reduced and the Militia abolished.<lb/>
When the Territorial Force was first explained to us we were informed in an Army Memorandum on the military forces in the United Kingdom that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial Force will be one of support and expansion, to be at once embodied when danger threatens, but not likely to be called for till after the expiration of the preliminary period of six months."</quote>
This gave rise to what became known as the six months of close time for the Territorial Army. The Secretary of State for War himself endorsed that view when speaking at Workington in July, 1908. He is thus reported&#x2014;
<quote>"It was said that they were only preparing their Force to become operative after six months of the enemy's invasion. No, they had arranged to keep command of the sea in the early days of the war, and they would not allow the Regulars to leave these shores until the Territorials were hardened sufficiently to resist any foe."</quote>
But if on the outbreak of hostilities you are to keep the Regular Army, including the Expeditionary Force, at home until the Territorial Force is hardened sufficiently to be sure to beat Continental invaders, you lose indefinitely the power of offensive action on the part of the Regular Army. Again, if the Regular Army should be sent over-seas by any sudden call to double the white garrison in India, to which no Government could be deaf, before the country has absolute confidence in the hardness of the Territorial Force, then the sphere of action of the Fleet must be limited by its retention in home waters as a coastguard. It soon became apparent for the success of the Territorial scheme that this particular feature of the new model Army&#x2014;namely, its incapacity to take the field until six months after the day it is required, that day being the declaration of war, must be made to vanish. And so it has. The Secretary of
<col>400</col>
State has advised the Government that the Territorial Infantry can be relied upon at a moment's notice to defeat the foreign invader.<lb/>
The reality of this readiness is a serious issue. It is directly raised by a most important statement on home defence which was made on November 30 last at Cambridge by the Secretary of State for War. It was made in consequence of a debate which had taken place in your Lordships' House. The right hon. gentleman is reported to have said that in the case of invasion&#x2014;
<quote>"the Home Defence Force would be of three kinds. There would be a local force all along the coast for the purpose of delaying and hindering an invading force. Then behind those there would be a swiftly moving central force which would consist of Regulars and Territorials in combination, and next there would be the garrison force. All this had been worked out months ago, and the work of the War Office had passed the stage of being talked about."</quote>
We see here the Government and their expert advisers are agreed amongst other matters upon a swiftly-moving central force composed of Regulars and Territorials in combination, acting behind local Territorial forces. I propose to consider only the quantity and quality of the Infantry arm. Of course, as regards the Territorial Artillery they must have a period of close time, because they have neither horses nor ammunition.<lb/>
The Secretary of State is preparing to crush a possible raid. A raid must be secret and sudden. It cannot be anything else. Its descent would be one of many opening moves in a great game to be simultaneously played by land and sea in many different places, and one of the first tricks would be played for here in Great Britain. This particular trick would be won or lost for what it is worth in less than forty-eight hours. Twenty-four hours to disembark and another twenty-four hours to strike the point aimed at would be all the time the raiders would require to achieve their object.<lb/>
Now let us first see what Regular Infantry there are available for this central force. The average strength of an Infantry battalion of the Regular Army at home, according to a Return laid on the Table of the House last year, was 580 men. The average number of men in each battalion
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0204"/>
<col>401</col>
of under twenty years of age was 247. I read in the last Army Medical Report that&#x2014;
<quote>"Average British recruits are on enlistment the youngest and in the poorest physical condition of those in any civilised Army. They cannot stand work which would not injure well-fed conscripts of twenty years of age."</quote>
Since that was written the immaturity of the Line at home has been increased by lowering the standard of age by one year&#x2014;namely, to seventeen instead of eighteen&#x2014;by means of enlistment through the Special Reserve. Eliminating all boys and all the unfit, a Regular Infantry battalion at home would not average, after the Indian and foreign service drafts had just gone abroad, more than 300 men for the fighting line. That is to say, a brigade of four battalions would, as regards numbers, represent the equivalent of one battalion at full war strength.<lb/>
There were in Great Britain by the last Army Annual Return forty-nine battalions of the Line and eight of the Guards&#x2014;fifty-seven in all. It would not be possible, owing to the many other demands for defence in the rest of the country, to put more than half of the whole Infantry battalions at home into the swiftly moving central force. Taking the strength of a Line battalion for the field at 300 men, and that of a Guards battalion rather more, we should get thirty battalions giving a field strength of less than 10,000 men. I believe the most reliable plan of securing victory in war is to have troops at least equal in quality with those of the enemy and very superior in quantity. If our Infantry is to be equal in quality to that of the invaders you must eliminate boys under twenty. The invasion of this country will not be carried out by cadet corps. But&#x2014;and this is more important&#x2014;this central force has not yet been concentrated. The Government, with the full support of the Army Council, propose to begin to concentrate their central force after the enemy has landed. At one time they meant to begin to train their Home Defence Army after war had broken out, but now, at the dictate of convenience, they use it at once and dispense with that training which they formerly said was essential. Pending the concentration of the central force and its subsequent transport to the scene of action&#x2014;an operation not of hours but days&#x2014;the enemy has been delayed by local forces all along the coast. In other words&#x2014;it is better to
<col>402</col>
put these matters plainly&#x2014;he has been winning a succession of easy victories over hastily collected driblets of our military forces, an inspiring and useful exercise for the invader which must have a disastrous effect on the <i>morale</i> of our Territorial Army. Assuming that it is possible to concentrate and then to convey the central force to the scene of action within forty-eight hours, then we may be able to oppose the invader with 10,000 Regular Infantry before he has attained his objective.<lb/>
But if we are to be superior in quantity as well as equal in quality we must rely on the enemy not landing more than 8,000 Infantry. You can for the moment bring all these home battalions up to 1,000 men or more apiece, thanks to the Regular Reserve formed by Lord Midleton which the Government have inherited but not created, and which they are proceeding to destroy. You must have time to get the Reservists back to the Colours. Are you justified in assuming that that interval of time will be allowed you? If you admit, as the Government do admit, the possibility of surprise, then you ought to be ready to deal promptly with that situation. If the surprise came when Parliament was not sitting, then constitutionally Parliament must assemble before the Reserves can be called out and the Territorial Army embodied. Under any circumstances, whether Parliament be sitting or not, or whether the Secretary of State for War acts with or without the sanction of Parliament, the Reservists must be summoned back from civil life by letters sent through the post from the different dep&#x00F4;ts to the men's last address. Every man after receiving his summons and railway warrant must travel to the dep&#x00F4;t of his regiment to draw his kit and equipment and for medical inspection. There are plenty of men here in London whose kits are in the north of Scotland or south of Ireland. They must go and get them. After that, if communications were stll open, Reservists must be dispatched from the different dep&#x00F4;ts to seek their several battalions wherever they might be. Then what of the fighting efficiency of the battalions as the Reservists come flocking in? There will be two or more Reservists, just called back from civil life, in the ranks for every young serving soldier. Battalions so composed can be no match in quality for the battalions which have been trained on a war footing for a considerable time. So much
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0205"/>
<col>403</col>
for the Regular Infantry before and during mobilisation.<lb/>
Now let us consider the Territorial Infantry. First I note that the Army Council by advising the Government that the Territorial Infantry is fit to be used in the swiftly moving central force at a moment's notice flatly contradict the finding of the Norfolk Commission which they emphatically endorsed in 1907. In an Army Memorandum issued in 1907 the following paragraph occurs&#x2014;
<quote>"Military opinion is unanimous in holding that the Militia, Yeomanry, and Volunteers, as at present constituted and serving under existing conditions, are quite unlit to take the field against European troops. This was the view adopted by the Elgin and Norfolk Commissions after taking a mass of evidence."</quote>
It may be interesting to refer to the views expressed by two witnesses before the Norfolk Commission&#x2014;Sir John French and Sir Ian Hamilton. The Inspector-General of the Forces stated, in evidence, that it would be very risky to attempt to meet Continental troops with our Auxiliary Forces, even after they had received a full year's training, which is rather different from a short fortnight's training. The Adjutant-General was then of opinion that six months recruit training and two months of annual training would produce troops which he would prefer to use to relieve Regular battalions in garrisons and coaling stations rather than to trust to in the field.<lb/>
This opinion completely condemns the Special Reserve, whose annual training is three weeks instead of two months, for the purpose which that force is designed by the Government&#x2014;namely, as a substitute for the Reserve of the Regular Army. Let me remind the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War of his words in the debate of May 18. The noble Lord then said&#x2014;
<quote>"The only thing you can hope to do is to mobilize your battalions on the peace establishment. You may have a few hundred or a few thousand men over, but, practically speaking, whatever is left over is a negligible quantity."</quote>
The present strength of the Regular Reserve is 135,000. The total number of men required for the Expeditionary Force from the Regular Reserve, according to an Army Memorandum of April, 1907, is 85,023, leaving a margin of 50,000 Regular Reservists at home. That is the result of
<col>404</col>
Lord Midleton's Reserve, but the policy of the Government will reduce that Reserve to the negligible quantity described by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War. Then in place of these 50,000 Regular Reservists reduced you employ Special Reservists, and hence it is quite clear that the Special Reserve is a substitute for the reductions in the Regular Reserve. But the Special Reserve, when the men who were obtained by bounties from the Militia become time-expired, will itself become a negligible quantity. In three years time, not now, if the Expeditionary Force should be sent abroad, then there would be nothing left behind except the unfit from the Reserve and the immature from the Colours. Then we must rely both for Home Defence and for the maintenance of the Army abroad on the Territorial Army.<lb/>
Under these circumstances it is indeed fortunate that since 1907 the opinion of the Army Council and of the great officers of the Army has entirely changed&#x2014;I regret that we have never been told the reason&#x2014;and that Territorial soldiers with no more training than the Volunteers and far less than the Militia can now be relied on to defeat the best of Continental troops. Are the Government prepared to assure us that that which they held to be true of the Volunteer Infantry in 1907 is untrue of the Territorial Infantry in 1909? Are we to believe that the change of name, for there is no change of training, plus an admirable paper organisation, has worked this miracle in efficiency? The Territorial Army do not profess to have time to acquire either drill or discipline. It is impossible to have discipline without the authority of the officers and non-commissioned officers having been fully established by long and constant association. The habit of discipline in a battalion can only be acquired by process of time, and time in the case of the Territorial Force is not available. The fighting value of the Territorial Infantry would, therefore, reside in the superiority of their skill with their rifles, their patriotism, and their courage. I am sure of their patriotism, and I do not doubt their courage any more than I doubt the patriotism and courage and devotion to duty of the men to whom they will be opposed. The difference will be that the invaders are all of them grown men and trained soldiers, and that the large majority of the defenders are neither.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0206"/>
<col>405</col>
On the point of superiority in skill with their rifles over their opponents, let me tell your Lordships the musketry training of the Territorial Infantry. The training of the recruit consists of two parts. The first part is to fire forty rounds, which need not be fired on a rifle range but can be fired in a shooting gallery with Morris tube ammunition, and this, being far more convenient than losing time and money by visits to the rifle range, is the course followed. The time necessary is two afternoons. The second part of the recruit's course is to fire twenty rounds of ball ammunition at distances between 100 and 500 yards. A recruit's course, therefore, consists of forty rounds of Morris tube ammunition which takes two afternoons, and twenty rounds on the rifle range which takes one afternoon&#x2014;a total recruit's musketry course of three afternoons, necessitating one visit only to the rifle range. The trained Territorial soldier's annual musketry course is divided into three parts. Parts 1 and 2 may be fired in a shooting gallery with Morris tube ammunition. Part 3 is to be fired with ball cartridge, and consists of twenty-three rounds at distances of from 100 to 500 yards. The annual musketry course of the trained Territorial soldier is, therefore, two or three attendances in the shooting gallery and twenty-three rounds on the rifle range to be fired in one day. If the Territorial soldier makes thirty points out of a possible ninety-seven on the day when he fires with ball cartridge on the range he is said to have reached the "qualification standard." I quote the following paragraph from the Musketry Regulations for the Territorial Army&#x2014;
<quote>"An efficient soldier, as regards musketry, is a soldier of the Territorial Army who has reached the 'qualification standard,' or, having failed to reach the standard is certified by his commanding officer to have made at least three visits (including standard test) to an open, miniature cartridge, or thirty yards range, and fired at least fifty round of ball ammunition or their equivalent,"</quote>
which is 445 rounds of Morris tube ammunition. Now that paragraph and the words "ball ammunition or their equivalent"&#x2014;the equivalent being Morris tube ammunition&#x2014;allow men who have failed to qualify in making an easy score on the range to be classed as "efficient soldiers as regards musketry" by firing a certain number of rounds of toy ammunition out of a service rifle. To ask us to rely for the defence of our country upon the skill of Territorial
<col>406</col>
marksmen who are returned year after year as non-efficient with their rifles would have been an obvious absurdity, so these men can be returned as "efficient soldiers as regards musketry" on the plan and according to the standard I have just explained. A Regular soldier fires an annual musketry course of 225 rounds of ball ammunition. The trained Territorial soldier fires an annual course of twenty-three rounds, with which he never need hit the target and yet can be classed as an efficient soldier as regards musketry. It may be better to have fired twenty-three rounds and missed than never to have fired at all. But that is all that can be said on behalf of this standard of musketry efficiency. I ask the Government whether they will not arrange that during this or the next training at least half the Territorial Infantry, instead of going to a seaside camp, which is pleasant and the mainstay of recruiting, or carrying out "battle practice" with rifles which they cannot use, which is futile, should be put as battalions through the musketry course of the Line, under the supervision of the Musketry Staff of the Regular Army, and publish the results compared with the musketry of the Regular Army. Then, but not till then, the country will know what kind of riflemen the mass of the Territorial Infantry really are.<lb/>
By the Return of July 7 there are now in the Territorial Infantry 674 officers and 67,087 men who have never fired a recruit's course of musketry. There are 1,805 officers and 53,367 men who have not fired a trained soldier's course. That is a total of 2,479 officers and 120,454 men who have not yet completed their annual musketry course of one afternoon. I also ask if the Territorial Force could not be medically inspected by Army surgeons during the course of their annual training. The Militia on the day of assembly were always inspected by Army surgeons and unfit men discharged. Surely it is not asking too much to be informed if men drawing pay to defend their country are really physically fit for that duty, and how their skill with their weapons compares with the standard of that of Regular troops, for to none other will the Territorial Army ever be opposed. If the result of these two tests was recorded in the next Report of the Inspector-General of the Forces on the Territorial Army, that Report would be of much more practical interest than the one now before us. At present the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0207"/>
<col>407</col>
Territorial Army is 41,371 men below its establishment&#x2014;that is, below the minimum which we were told was consistent with safety. There are 98,335 non-commissioned officers and men below twenty years of age, and 162,341 men of twenty years of age and over, and out of that number of men 62,506 are serving on a one year engagement.<lb/>
It is incomprehensible to me, but I know it to be a fact&#x2014;the Army Council know it to be a fact and they take every advantage of it&#x2014;that if the Territorial Army can be recruited up to ninety per cent. of its establishment, then public opinion will consider the success of the scheme complete, our military problem solved, and the safety of the Empire assured. I am quite aware that not to be satisfied with mere numbers on paper but to ask for tests simple but searching, such as I have done, is held to be the mark of an unpatriotic and of a narrow mind. I admit that on one point my mind is of the narrowest. I can never consider any military force designed for instant use against a foreign invader save from the point of view of its immediate fighting efficiency. Whatever may be the other purposes served by the Territorial Force we are assured that it stands between the country and compulsory service. Towards this question the attitude of the Government is most obscure. If the Government were genuinely opposed to all forms of compulsion, why were they in such a hurry to destroy those forms of voluntary service which existed amongst our military forces, and which, in spite of many imperfections, none of them incapable of remedy, enabled us to maintain an Army of 300,000 men over-seas during the South African war?<lb/>
The statement, or rather the threat, contained in the Proclamation to the men of London issued last December that&#x2014;
<quote>"the only alternative to voluntary is compulsory service,"</quote>
shows no objection in principle to the adoption of that alternative. It also supplies one of the strongest arguments that can be used to destroy the principle of voluntary enlistment. I cannot myself conceive any better argument for keeping men out of the Territorial Force than telling them that they ought to join in order to save others from the burden of military service. A certain business company lately decided to insist on all their new <i>employ&#x00E9;es</i> joining the Territorial Army.<lb/>
<col>408</col>
This decision did not find favour with the leaders of the Labour Party, but the Secretary of State for War, when interrogated by them upon the subject, expressed his approval of the course which had been adopted. Why is compulsion by an individual employer more justifiable than compulsion by the State? The question I ask the Government is, Do they approve of recruiting the Territorial Army firstly by threats of compulsory service if recruits are not to be obtained by voluntary enlistment, and secondly by encouraging compulsion to enlist on the part of individual employers? If they do approve of such a system, surely they must see that they are supporting compulsory methods. If they do not approve, they ought to repudiate at once a recruiting system of this kind, instead of profiting by its results.<lb/>
The Government started by proclaiming that the whole aim of their new organisation was to bury deep deep down compulsory service. Yet as a matter of fact they are getting nearer and nearer to compulsion every day. For instance, the Secretary of State for War, in addressing the London Rifle Brigade in January last, is thus reported&#x2014;
<quote>"The question increasingly put to him was, 'Why don't you ask Parliament to impose an obligation on all to serve for home defence?' He had sympathy with that question. He thought most people agreed that the slacker, who simply amused himself and did nothing for his country, was a poor creature, and if the time of need came the country would no doubt show what it thought of him. In all probability he would find a short and sharp Act of Parliament passed if war broke out, compelling hint to train himself and do it in some inconvenient and unpleasant part of the country where he would not have the prominence of the undoubted popular esteem which was given to the man who trained himself as a Volunteer for the defence of his native land."</quote>
Here the Government express their conviction that when war comes a short and sharp Act of Parliament will be passed applying compulsion to that military organisation with which they have just endowed us. I observe that Sir John French, on March 22, in a speech at West Bromwich, advised all those in favour of compulsory service to support the Territorial Army&#x2014;
<quote>"because if ever their views came to prevail compulsory service could be brought about with the present force by a mere stroke of the pen."</quote>
The Government warmly approve of compulsion on the part of the individual
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0208"/>
<col>409</col>
employers of labour, although they condemn it on the part of the State. They anticipate a short and sharp Act of Parliament to compel men to serve on emergency in their Territorial organisation. They specially devise a plan which shall bury deep deep down all compulsion, but the plan is yet so ingeniously contrived that by a mere stroke of the pen compulsion can be applied. Yet that stroke of the pen, according to the Secretary of State for War, will destroy the Regular Army. The right hon. gentleman, in introducing the Army Estimates, insisted&#x2014;
<quote>"that a compulsorily-raised Army at home is incompatible with a voluntarily-enlisted foreign service Army."</quote>
The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War informed us, in an address on the Territorial Army which he delivered on May 14 at the City Liberal Club, that&#x2014;
<quote>"He thoroughly believed that conscription was the only alternative, because the present scheme was the last word that would be said, and the last that could be done, for the voluntary system."</quote>
But the Secretary of State for War has told us that a compulsorily-raised home Army is the destruction of the Regular Army. And, my Lords, the disappearance of the Regular Army is the end of the Empire.<lb/>
This then is the blind alley into which we have been led by His Majesty's Government after four years of clear thinking about military problems. Absolutely apart from all military organisation I strongly support a universal compulsory system of physical training for both sexes. But that is an entirely different question from the one raised by the Bill now before us. If the time has really come when perforce for the defence of our homes we must rely, like Continental nations, on universal compulsory military service, then we must also perforce adopt Continental methods. If not, we must assume that we can obtain better results by training eighteen-year-old boys for four months than Continental Powers secure by training twenty-year-old men for two years. Any increase in the training period beyond four months would entail an expenditure which must cripple the Regular Army, and might even affect our spending power on the Navy.<lb/>
I do not admit that the failure of the Special Reserve and of the Territorial
<col>410</col>
Army must entail resort to compulsion. There is an alternative. The Secretary of State for War, in introducing the Army Estimates, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The old Auxiliary Forces cost &#x00A3;4,400,000. The Special Reserve and Territorial Army may cost &#x00A3;4,900,000, but, on the other hand, the Regulars will be cheaper."</quote>
And so they ought to be, for there are 40,000 less. Take these five millions now wasted on the Territorial Army and the Special Reserve&#x2014;wasted because no adequate return is obtained in national safety&#x2014;spend these five millions on the Regular Army in keeping part of the Army always on a war footing, in obtaining a sufficient supply of officers, in increasing your Regular Reserve, and in being more generous in the way of pensions to the men who have been invalided and have lost their health in the service of their country. Then you will indeed have made a substantial addition to our national defences.<lb/>
The First Sea Lord told us eighteen months ago to&#x2014;
<quote>"sleep quiet in our beds and not be disturbed by those bogies of invasion which are being periodically resuscitated by all sorts of Leagues."</quote>
My own state of mind as regards the bogies referred to by the First Sea Lord is much the same as that of the man who said he did not believe in ghosts but was always afraid of them. I do not believe in "bolts from the blue," but I am afraid of them. Never would I be unprepared to meet them, and never would I meet them on the lines proposed by the Government, lines which concede initial success to the raider and entail great subsequent slaughter of patriotic but untrained men in desperate attempts, which may or may not be successful, to smother quality by quantity. In my opinion there is but one method of dealing swiftly and successfully with raids&#x2014;namely, to keep part of the Regular Army always on a war footing, that is to say, ready for instant action, without calling up a single officer, man, horse, or gun from any Reserve. A force of that kind was in process of formation by His Majesty's late Government, but was at once abandoned by the present Government.<lb/>
We read in the last Report of the Inspector-General of the Forces that some of the factors acting adversely to an entirely
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0209"/>
<col>411</col>
satisfactory training of the Infantry of the Regular Army are&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Numerical weakness of many of the companies, especially in the early part of the training season.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) The deficiency of subaltern officers in many units during company training often owing to their absence on other duties, such as Mounted Infantry, signalling, musketry, etc.</li></ol>
The men are not there. The Officers are absent employed on duties away from their regiments. The surprise, admitted to be possible by the Government, comes, and what then? Mobilisation ensues, and we are not allowed to know anything about mobilisation. The time has undoubtedly come when the choice must be made between an increase of our Regular Forces, such as I have indicated, and universal compulsory service, but on the Continental method. We are not, however, a Continental country, but an island; and I, for my own part, believe you will find it sounder, more efficacious, and certainly in the end more economical, to pay for the skilled labour you require for a Regular Army with a Regular Reserve sufficient to set your minds at rest concerning national defence, rather than to attempt universal service.<lb/>
I appeal to the Government to abandon ambiguities and to tell us plainly and once and for all what is the use of the Territorial Army. Is it to compensate us for maritime failure? Is it a mere paper inscription of the names of all sorts and conditions of men ready to assemble on mobilisation and commence systematic training for war with the units on whose rolls their names are borne? Is it an Army upon which we must rely to defeat at a moment's notice the best of Continental troops who have effected a surprise landing upon our shores? Is it a big national Reserve out of which to supply the waste of war for the Regular Army serving over-seas? All these uses have been assigned to the Territorial Army by the Secretary of State for War in speeches made in his place in Parliament, on public platforms, and in the many Memoranda issued from the War Office on military matters.<lb/>
I cannot give my vote for the Bill introduced by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, because I agree with the Secretary of State for War that a compulsorily-raised home service Army is incompatible with a foreign service Army on a voluntary basis. I cannot follow the noble Duke into the Lobby, because that would be to give a vote
<col>412</col>
in favour of a Territorial Army, to which, in my opinion, for the reasons I have given, it is hopeless to look for the solution of the problem of defence insular and Imperial. But immediate action is required. I agree with the view expressed by Mr. Arnold-Forster in the last book he ever published, that our first duty is to strengthen the Navy; our second duty is to strengthen the Army; the rest may wait.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00777"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to associate myself with the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, who, in introducing this Bill has, in my opinion, shown the necessity of having the Territorial Army far more efficient than it is at the present day for the purpose for which it has been formed&#x2014;namely, national defence. He has, I think, very clearly proved that this can only be done by universal service in some form, thereby putting the military fabric of this country on a sounder basis than it has ever been before. If there is one man in England at present who may be regarded as best qualified to speak with authority on military questions, that man undoubtedly is the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts. The scheme as set forth in this Bill will enable the people of this country to concentrate their opinion and realise the nature of the proposals. When the principles of the Bill are better understood, I have little fear as to what the verdict of the people will be, for I am not one of those who believe that the Englishman of the present day is lacking in Imperial instincts. I have always contended, in fact felt quite sure, that if some great leader would come forward and teach the people that the first duty of an Englishman is to learn to defend his country, whilst to shirk this duty is to jeopardise its existence, such an appeal would be readily responded to by the nation as a whole. Time will prove whether I am right or not in this contention.<lb/>
My excuse for taking part in the debate is that I was one of the original members of the National Service League, and therefore cannot be regarded as a recent convert to the question of universal service. Had I not been already convinced, I think, after hearing the very sound arguments laid before us by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, and also by Lord Milner, my conversion on this occasion would have been complete. Having also been connected
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0210"/>
<col>413</col>
with His Majesty's Forces for over thirty-two years, I know only too well what the opinions of the officers of the Army are on this question. They are of opinion that unless the people are taught to realise the necessity of universal service, the security of this country cannot be assured.<lb/>
What possible objection can be urged against the principle that every able-bodied man shall be called upon, not only throughout the United Kingdom, but throughout the Empire, to fulfil the first and most fundamental duty of citizenship&#x2014;that of the defence of his country? At the present time I regret to think it is a matter of individual goodwill rather than one of universal sacrifice. It has often been mentioned that if we had universal service recruits for the Regular Army would not be forthcoming. The <i>Spectator</i> company showed direct proof against that argument. I contend that if we had universal service we should get far better noncommissioned officers and officers than we have ever had before, and in cases of emergency we should be able to put our hands upon a far larger number of men for active service abroad than we have ever been able to before. Under our present voluntary system can anyone say that we are getting the pick of the manhood of the nation. Can anyone believe, too, that if we had had universal service in this country prior to the South African war we should have lost so many valuable lives and so much money? In my opinion the war would probably never have taken place.<lb/>
There is another very important aspect of the case which has been referred to by a member of the Episcopal Bench. The moral welfare of the nation would undoubtedly be greatly improved and there would be produced qualities of discipline, self-control, and obedience, whilst at the same time the physique and the health of the nation would be improved. When the people of this country realise the many hard facts that have been adduced in the discussion in your Lordships' House, I believe they will recognise the advantages of compulsory service and thereby dispel the argument that has often been used that the people of this country would not stand it. A more unpatriotic sentiment was never uttered, and to my mind it is most unjust, for the question has never been put to them.<lb/>
What, then, is the alternative to compul-
<col>414</col>
sory service for home defence? I suppose the answer would be the present Territorial Army. But only last week the Under-Secretary of State for War said that at the present time it was not capable of meeting an invasion, but was likely to be so at some future date. If that is so I venture to think that the proposal which the noble Duke, myself, and others brought forward about eighteen months ago in your Lordships' House&#x2014;that until the Territorial Army actually came into being, it was folly to abolish the Militia&#x2014; was a legitimate one. It is quite evident, from the War Office Return laid on the Table of your Lordships' House, that the main object for which the Militia were done away with and transferred to the First Line under the name of the Special Reserve was to make the people believe that there are more trained men in the country available for active service than there had ever been before. Therefore I was not in the least surprised when on putting a Question a month ago to the Under-Secretary of State for War with regard to the Expeditionary Force, he was obliged to give me an evasive answer on the plea of public interests. When tactics such as these are pursued it is, in my opinion, nothing more or less than endeavouring by a juggling of figures to hoodwink the people of this country as to the real state of affairs. I think that is one of the strongest arguments in favour of compulsory service. My Lords, I shall have great pleasure in supporting the Bill brought forward by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00778"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who leads the House referred to a speech made by Lord Lyndhurst in this House about fifty years ago. I well recollect reading that speech and the interest that it caused right through the country. He was an old man of eighty-seven, and his "V&#x00E6; victis" speech, as it was called, was quoted and re-quoted on every platform and by every paper in the country. That scare of 1859 did one great thing for Great Britain. It gave us the Channel Fleet and it gave us the Volunteers. I hope that this scare will not pass away until it has left us definitely with a two-European Power Standard for the Navy and universal service for the Home Army.<lb/>
The Under-Secretary of State for War remarked yesterday that no authoritative statement had been made on the naval
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0211"/>
<col>415</col>
question and of the view of the Navy in this House. I think it would be very difficult to get an authoritative statement. In the first place, there is no real representative of the Admiralty in this House. There is no one, failing the Master of the Horse, to represent the Government, and he is so busy in attending to matters connected with the performance of his Court and other duties that he cannot do it thoroughly. No Member of this House has ever commanded a Fleet, and I believe only one Member of this House has ever commanded a battleship. I refer to the Marquess of Bristol, who I understand does not intend to address the House to-night. When this House has been reformed, and all First Sea Lords and Admirals who have commanded our chief Fleets in home waters are made Life Peers on ceasing to hold office or while holding office, then this difficulty will, as a matter of course, be removed.<lb/>
I have studied the question of invasion for years. My first acquaintance with the embarkation and disembarkation of troops was in bringing our Army back from the Crimea. I have been First Lieutenant of two troopships, and have been personally responsible for the details of the embarkation and disembarkation of thousands of men. Lord Lucas declares that the enemy's coast must be our frontier. I hope that it may be so, but we must recollect that underwater warfare has revolutionised naval tactics. If we keep our battleships close to the enemy's coasts they will run a great risk of being sunk by mines and torpedoes. If we had a day or two of ill-luck, and these tactics were adopted, the command of the sea might pass away from us. If an enemy could hold the North Sea for four or five days it would be a case of Good-bye England. It would be of little use to recover the command of the North Sea after a large force had landed in this country. Look at the islands with which the coast is studded from Jutland to the mouth of the Scheldt, and see how far superior it is for strategical and embarkation purposes than the French coast which is opposite the Channel. A great deal of our success over the French has been due to that magnificent natural harbour behind the Isle of Wight, for which the French have no equivalent. Torpedo vessels can pass along nearly the whole of the German and Dutch coasts, issue from whence they please, and it would be impossible to
<col>416</col>
know at which particular point of the coast they might be assembling. If an enemy's fleet got into the open sea our natural course would be to follow it, if necessary, across the Atlantic and strike it wherever we could. If it evaded us, which is quite possible&#x2014;our fleets do miss one another at naval man&#x0153;uvres, and we may miss an enemy's fleet in time of war&#x2014;we shall have no second fleet to beat the enemy in the North Sea as we are giving up the two-Power standard. We should therefore remain for some days open to invasion. If to avoid this we kept our Fleet in home waters, the enemy's ships in the Atlantic would intercept our food supplies and in a fortnight high prices and famine would probably ensue.<lb/>
There are very exaggerated ideas about the amount of transport that troops require for a journey. One ton per man and sufficient deck space for the man to lie down in is all that the Board of Trade allow passengers between Hamburg and the Thames. As troops are under discipline they would require even less. I do not think an enemy would bring many stores with him except ammunition and harness for his artillery. Horses, provisions, and wagons are to be found by the thousand in England. Any moderate-sized farm could feed an enemy's regiment for a day or two. There would be sheep and oxen, potatoes and roots for the rank and file, and ducks, turkeys and geese for the officers. The half a dozen different patterns of carts and wagons found about our farms would be soon organised, classified, and put into their respective categories. The difficulty of embarking and disembarking increases more in proportion than the size of an army. I think it would be five times as difficult to bring 100,000 men across as to bring 50,000. We made an experiment in disembarking troops two or three years ago at Clacton-on-Sea. That was our first attempt to disembark a trained army on the beach, and you can draw no conclusion from it unless such an experiment is repeated sufficiently often for the men to learn their work. Then the transports were at anchor all night, and it was said that that was a very dangerous position. So it was, but in war they would probably have been run ashore to avoid being sunk by torpedo boats. In a war the loser would have to pay for the transports; therefore a country risking the invasion of England might risk a great deal with the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0212"/>
<col>417</col>
idea that we might have to pay for those transports.<lb/>
The fact that seventy Admirals belong to the National Service League is, I think, sufficient proof that some of them believe invasion to be possible. I will touch on one non-nautical matter. It has been asked where we are to get officers for this force? If we have compulsion a large number of the men who otherwise would have to serve in the ranks will prefer serving as officers, and the well-educated and well-to-do parents in this country will send their sons to the officers' training college at the University. When once you have the power to make them serve in the ranks you will get a considerable rise in the number and in the standard of officers. I was well acquainted with the French Army many years ago. Before 1870 I met them on service in China, and saw them at several places when my ship was on the coast of Mexico when war was proceeding on that shore. Before 1870 conscription was avoided by a money payment of about &#x00A3;60, and the result of that was that there were very few officers in the French Army belonging to what we call in England the well-to-do, well-educated classes. After the Republic was established the French proceeded to democratise the Army, and insisted upon universal service regardless of the size of the purse. They made all youths liable to conscription on reaching a certain age. Many of the sons of the educated classes preferred to enter the French Army as officers, a thing that had not happened before, and the result is that the French Army is very much better officered than it was in the time of the Second Empire. It has been said that we are putting an intolerable burden on the shoulders of the people liable to universal service. It may be heavy, but it is lighter than the yoke of the foreigner. I hope that this debate and the Division which will shortly take place will do much towards advancing public opinion in the direction of compulsory service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00779"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what we have to vote upon to-night is the noble Duke's Amendment. It is a very clever piece of political strategy which does not commend itself to my ideas with regard to this great question. I do not know whether it will commend itself to the country, but I am certain it does not com-
<col>418</col>
mend itself to a great many noble Lords in this House. At no period in our history were the doings of this House so carefully watched as they are now. Everybody is asking, "What will the House of Lords do?" And in view of that I take very strong exception to the Amendment proposed by the Duke of Northumberland. This House is quite capable of voting, yea or nay, upon a Bill of this sort, and not on a Resolution which practically sidetracks the gallant Field-Marshal's Bill.<lb/>
I also take exception to the Amendment on the ground that it puts us into the Lobby with the present Government. I would like to remind the noble Duke of what he said about the Secretary of State for War at the end of his speech, when he referred to Mr. Haldane in no unmeasured terms. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It was absurd to say that his Motion was a vote of confidence in Mr. Haldane and his military advisers. He did not believe in Mr. Haldane or any of his works. But their Lordships passed the Territorial Army Bill, and although he was a thorough disbeliever in the system he felt that the Government had a right to ask that it should have a fair trial. He protested that the last thing he would think of doing would be to move a vote of confidence in the Government."</quote>
But the noble Duke asks us to-day to go into the Lobby with the Government who are supporting Mr. Haldane's scheme, and I take exception to that. I do not wish to be a passenger in the Government's boat, or to take an oar and help row the boat even for a short while. Therefore I shall not give my vote for the noble Duke's Resolution.<lb/>
But the question is a much larger one than one of momentary political expediency. Do we think it necessary, in the face of the enormous armaments which the Powers of Europe are now creating, especially one Power, to have compulsory military training or a voluntary system? This Bill has been called by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary for War conscription. It is not conscription. Conscription is when a man is forced to become a soldier, and also forced to leave the country and fight in a foreign land. That is just the difference between Lord Roberts's Bill and conscription. This Bill is not conscription; it is, as the noble Lord will admit, compulsory military training. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition, Lord Lansdowne, rather advocated that every youth
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0213"/>
<col>419</col>
in a school should be trained to hold himself up straight and to shoot with a rifle. That is something to have gained from my noble leader, who is going to vote for the noble Duke's Resolution.<lb/>
When the critics begin to attack the noble and gallant Field-Marshal's Bill they attack it in detail. That is done to every Bill, and when it becomes an Act we are then told that a coach and four can be driven through it. But the critics take it for granted that we are to swallow the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill. There are other stages at which the critics of the Bill can bring in any Amendments they think fit. The principle of compulsory military training, not conscription, is one that no one need be afraid to put before the rising generation of this country, the young men who will govern and fight for their country in the future. I will make one remark upon the criticism of Lord Midleton, who said in the debate yesterday&#x2014;
<quote>"He submitted that it was not sufficient to prove that this system was useful or advantageous. All the facts as to the situation in which we found ourselves in the late war were well known to the noble Earl when he became Commander-in-Chief, and he could not help asking what had occurred since the noble Earl vacated the post in the last five years to make it necessary to adopt this great change."</quote>
What has occurred? Lord Lansdowne himself admitted that the two-Power standard had been given up. And the noble Lords in office now and the Prime Minister have admitted that the armaments of one great Power have advanced much more quickly than we ever gave them credit for. Therefore the situation has completely changed. That change has taken place since the noble and gallant Field-Marshal was Commander-in-Chief of the Army; hence the reason for bringing forward this measure.<lb/>
With regard to Ireland, I know my country pretty well. Ireland has been treated separately with regard to other measures, and with regard to this she will have to be treated in a separate manner if you impose compulsory military training upon her. There is that difficulty, but I set off against that the extreme popularity of the Yeomanry both in the North and South of Ireland. The difficulties that have been put forward and used as arguments against Lord Roberts's Bill are not so insurmountable as one imagines. I
<col>420</col>
would like to say a word on what the noble Lord on the Front Bench said with regard to the voluntary system killing the power of the Regular Army to go and fight in a foreign country. Lord Lucas said&#x2014;
<quote>"The noble and gallant Field-Marshal had quoted the experience of this country during the long period which followed the French Revolution but had ignored the earlier experiences of the Army during the same war. During the period before Trafalgar there was what was called 'an ignominious panic of invasion.' A parallel of the system which was now advocated was then in force."</quote>
The noble Lord, I suppose, has read history. Let me remind him that there was nothing ignominious about the panic. It was a very serious question. On October 2, 1804, Napoleon had assembled 160,000 men at Boulogne, with 10,000 horses and a flotilla of vessels and 17,000 sailors, to invade England. A really serious crisis had arisen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00780"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: They are not my words; they are Mr. Hallam's.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00781"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Yes, but you quoted those words in order to support the argument that if we went in for strong home defence the Regular Army could not be detached to go abroad. But there is no analogy in the situation whatever. I do not care a brass farthing what Hallam said. I only give the facts quoted in history. I cannot see why Lord Lucas mentioned that very great national danger. If there had been fine weather these flat-bottomed boats might very easily have got across. What happened? Trafalgar came. Napoleon felt that he had no power to protect his troops coming over, and then came the battle of Austerlitz. Then we were quite free from the terrible force at Boulogne, and our Army was free. I take exception to the noble Lord reading history in the way he did. There was a real danger then and that is why the Volunteer movement of those times took place. The people could almost see the Frenchmen on the opposite side. I will not give my vote to the Duke of Northumberland's Resolution, but shall vote for the principle of the Bill. I admit that the Bill is open to criticism, but I should not be the least afraid, and a great many on this side are with me, to go to public meetings in this country and say that I consider a situation has arisen on the Continent, admitted by both political Parties, which would justify compulsory military training in this country.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0214"/>
<col>421</col>
I admit that a little blow was given to the scheme in regard to Ireland and that special arrangements would have to be made in regard to that country. But we in Ireland do not want to be invaded any more than you in this country do. There are plenty of very loyal people over there like there are here. You hear a great deal of irresponsible talk, and, I am sorry to say, what is called disloyal talk, but when the crisis comes there will be no difficulty. An illustration is given by the north and south Yeomanry in Ireland; they were, at first, laughed at but they have been a great success. I came here with an open mind, but I shall not vote for the Duke of Northumberland's Resolution. I think it is not a right way of dealing with the matter, and I shall, as I have said, vote for the principle embodied in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00782"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RAGLAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, said this was an entirely new departure. I venture to say that this is nothing like a new departure. Compulsory service for the defence of this land has been the law ever since there was a law. It is at this moment in force, although noble Lords opposed to this system always conveniently forget it, and it would only require the omission of a certain Act from the Expiring Acts Continuance Bill to put the ballot once more into force.<lb/>
In asking the House to affirm this principle, we are not bringing any new departure before your Lordships, or springing upon the country any system to which they have not hitherto been accustomed. As recently as the year 1831, which, after all, is within the recollection of many members of your Lordships' House, the Militia was composed entirely of balloted men. Therefore the fact that compulsory service was in existence a comparatively short time ago proves that this is no new departure.<lb/>
There are one or two points to which I regret the noble Duke should have alluded. One is the extraordinary line he took up with regard to the deteriorating influence of soldiering on those people who are called upon to do it. If the noble Duke was serious in regard to that it is the very strongest possible argument against having any military force at all. That deteriorating influence would affect men serving voluntarily equally as much as it would
<col>422</col>
influence men serving compulsorily, and therefore these deteriorating influences must be having a very serious effect upon those men who are now in the Territorial Forces of the King. I think that the noble Duke, when be comes to think over and to read the words he has spoken, will be ashamed of them, and will not attempt ever to use that argument again.<lb/>
Another point to which the noble Duke alluded was that of passive resistance. There are plenty of ways of dealing with the passive resister. There are many duties connected with an army which can be performed with perfect safety by any man who objects to shedding blood. He can join the Medical Corps or the Army Service Corps. The number of passive resisters, I assume, will not be very great, and there would be very little difficulty in dealing with them. One other point which has been brought up repeatedly in this debate is the question of the drill of boys at school. The noble Duke suggested that it was a great pity the National Service League did not confine themselves to advocating the drill of boys at school. The noble Earl opposite devoted a large portion of his speech to advocating that subject, and even the noble Earl, Lord Meath, devoted the greater part of his speech to that particular subject. I am very anxious about this point, because it is one of a series of continual and repeated attempts to sidetrack the National Service League. The object of the National Service League, the object of our agitation and of this Bill, is to provide the country as far as possible with a military force which is capable of defending it. I entirely deny the possibility of doing one atom towards producing a military force of any description by drilling little boys at school whom you lose sight of at fourteen years of age. Then again, drill is not the extraordinary and abstruse kind of thing people seem to imagine. I would undertake myself, having had some considerable experience of soldiering, to take any ten men out of the street and to teach them within ten days or a fortnight amply sufficient drill to enable them to take their place in any well-organised force&#x2014;that is, as far as drill is concerned. Personally, I do not consider accuracy of drill is everything. It is something, but it is not in itself discipline. Discipline is an essential to an armed force, and discipline can only be obtained by mutual training. That a boy drilled at school by an instructor five or six years ago, when drill may be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0215"/>
<col>423</col>
very different from now, would be an efficient substitute in any way for a trained soldier I entirely deny.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War made a very interesting, and, from his point of view, very admirable, speech with regard to our proposals. He dissected our subject into little pieces, picked a great many holes in it, and argued that forces trained as we suggest would be absolutely useless for the defence of the country. He said that men after four months preliminary drill would be no use at all. If that is so then the noble Lord is bound to deduct the whole of his Territorial Force, because most of them have not done anything approaching four months drill. We arrive at this extraordinary position from the noble Lord's speech, that 500,000 men who have done four months drill to start with, and will do a fortnight for two or three years, are not sufficiently well trained to defeat an enemy, whereas 250,000 men trained for a fortnight a year are. That is perfectly absurd on the face of it, and only shows to what shifts the noble Lord was driven to find fault with our scheme.<lb/>
There is one other point to which the noble Lord drew attention. He jeered at us for reducing our million men to 300,000. I should like to point out to the noble Lord that the Secretary of State of War reduced his 900,000 men to 300,000 men, whom he has not got. The noble Lord who spoke afterwards pointed out to the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War that in our scheme we should have something approaching a million and a half of men who at least would have received considerably more training than the 250,000 men in the Territorial Army. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary made one most excellent pronouncement, for which I thank him. He laid down in the clearest and most unmistakable manner that the truest form of defence was to be in a position to take the offensive. The noble Lord then proceeded to point those remarks with certain facts and fancies taken from the old French war. He said that in the old French war the nation spent very vast efforts and a considerable sum of money in raising local forces for local defence, and that that had not only done no great good to the country, but had prevented the Regular Army from being sufficiently recruited to enable it to carry on its work across the seas. He also quoted
<col>424</col>
the words of Mr. Windham. I take it that the noble Lord has not got a very large amount of time for reading, but I would most earnestly commend him to read the Parliamentary debates that took place in the early years of the last century. The complaint of Mr. Windham and his party was not that the Government had reformed this or that, or done too much or done too little. What they said was&#x2014;
<quote>"Not only have you failed to raise an Army such as the country requires, but you have taken the most effectual possible steps to prevent that Army being raised."</quote>
What was it they did? The Government went half-heartedly into the question of national defence. They thought they were going to effect national defence on a voluntary system. They had their Regular Army, the Regular Militia, whom they kept up by the ballot to a certain fixed figure, generally between 60,000 and 80,000, and they thought they would encourage the formation of an immense force of Volunteers. Those Volunteers arrived at this pitch. They clamoured continually for more money, they refused to do the very smallest modicum of training, and they absorbed the entire available manhood of the nation. It was only when the country frankly accepted the view of personal and universal liability for service by raising the Local Militia and compelling everybody to serve in it that they were enabled to raise a sufficient Army to make a respectable appearance on the continent of Europe. It was only when that was done, when the Volunteers practically disappeared in the formation of Local Militia, that we were enabled to produce a sufficient Army to make an effectual diversion in a European conflict.<lb/>
There is one point which has been more than once alluded to. We are told that this is going to interfere with the Army and with the Navy. I wish to echo most emphatically what has fallen from many friends of the movement that our chief object in these proposals is to free the hands of the Regular Army and of the Navy. We all know, and His Majesty's Government have said so over and over again, that such is the state of our military forces that the whole of our Regular Army must be tied to these shores for an indefinite period in the event of a war. I think very possibly a large portion of our Navy will be in the same position. What does that
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0216"/>
<col>425</col>
mean? Imagine a war declared. The Government of the day may be very strong. Well, I have sat a great many years in this House, and my experience is that as Governments get more strong so they get more timorous. The country will practically have no respectable local force for defence. Very possibly political pressure will be brought upon the Government of the day not only to send no Army abroad or any troops abroad, but to keep the Navy within sight of these shores. Every watering place around the coast will be clamouring to have something it can see in the shape of a fleet. The Government may be strong, but it will find it very difficult to resist pressure of that sort, and I cannot help thinking that what you will see will be a sort of wild attempt at stringing over a large stretch of coast little wretched weak squadrons trying to defend the country everywhere and being unable really to defend it anywhere. So strongly is this felt by naval officers that the National Service League includes among its numbers over seventy flag officers of the Navy. I think that is a very strong point.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Leader of the House alluded to the fact that the naval advisers of His Majesty's Government had never asked for compulsory service in any shape or form. I dare say that is the case. I do not know that naval officers in the present state of things are likely to be very free with their advice on any important subject, but every naval officer of any standing has most strongly felt the absolute necessity of compulsory service for the Army in order to free the Navy. It is a matter that admits of no doubt whatever. I can assure the noble Earl that every naval officer I have ever spoken to, unless he happened to be for the moment inside the Admiralty, was even more strongly in favour of a scheme of this description than any soldier I have ever come across.<lb/>
There is a point with regard to the Territorial Army which I think has not been touched upon in this debate, and about which I myself feel very strongly. It is the danger, I think I can say the absolutely certainty, of the embodiment of the Territorial Force being put off until it is too late. I have a memory. I can remember nine years back. There was a war going on in South Africa. The country was in a state of very considerable
<col>426</col>
&#x2014;I will not say panic, because that is a word we are not allowed to use&#x2014;but of very considerable uneasiness with regard to its armed forces and its state of protection in the event of further complications. The Volunteers as they then existed were asked to do a month's training. They refused. I do not blame those men for refusing. They said it was impossible for them to carry out that month's training. His Majesty's Government, a strong Government with a large majority in both Houses of Parliament, with the country thoroughly behind them clamouring to have its military forces put in order, were afraid to insist upon any portion of the force going out and doing a month's training. If the Government under those circumstances were afraid, how will any Government in the future be able to deal with the Territorial Force? Necessarily the same thing will happen. The Territorial embodiment will be considered advisable by the military advisers of the Crown, the Government of the day will send for the commanding officers of the Territorial Force and say, "We consider it necessary to embody you at once." Everyone will immediately begin to make excuse. They will say, "Our men cannot do it, they cannot give up their situations." The result will be that the embodiment of the Territorial Force will be put off to the very last possible moment, and the famous six months training, of which we have heard so much, will under no circumstances take place.<lb/>
The Under-Secretary of State for War also alluded to Mr. Cardwell's scheme. I would like to remind the noble Lord that one of the most fundamental principles of the whole of that scheme was the revival of the ballot for the Militia. It was dropped and it knocked the bottom out of the scheme. When one of the greatest War Ministries we have ever had set to work to reorganise the forces of the Crown one of the first points which he considered absolutely essential was the filling up of the Militia Forces for home defence by compulsory service.<lb/>
The Secretary for Scotland is the only person I have ever come across in any class who says that it is not the duty of an able-bodied man to defend his country. The noble Lord is the only man I have ever heard of who has said that. He practically said that it was not a particular duty
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0217"/>
<col>427</col>
of a man to defend his country. He used the expression "an assumed duty." I will leave the noble Lord on that lofty eminence in a minority of one, except to add one word. The noble Lord says invasion is impossible. Then why does he belong to a Government which keeps up the Territorial Army? Why spend money on a Territorial Army? Why not disband the Territorial Army, divide the money between the Regular Army and the Navy, and so save money which, if he is correct, can only be spent on an unnecessary luxury?<lb/>
Then as to the Navy I quite agree with the sentiment that the Navy is the only thing that, under God's good providence, defends this country. How long is the Navy going to be in a position to defend this country? Only to-day, for all I know to the contrary, an airship may have crossed from Calais to Dover. You may say that is a toy. The first locomotive was a toy, and the first steamship was a toy. It may be a toy now; it may be a toy for six months, for one year, or for five years, but sooner or later it will cease to be a toy; and when dirigible airships are able to cross the seas what is the value of a Navy? That is a point on which I feel very strongly. At any moment your great Dreadnoughts may become, I will not say useless, but their value may be enormously depreciated. The moment that occurs this country ceases to be an island and becomes, for all practical purposes, a Continental nation.<lb/>
There are many of your Lordships who have seen war; there are many who have seen a great deal of war; but there are not many of your Lordships who have seen a Continental war. We all know that war is a most appalling thing. I suppose war is one of the most awful things that can befall a nation, but we in this country know nothing about war. There is hardly an inhabitant of a Continental country who cannot remember, or at any rate whose grandfather cannot tell him of, the time when his country was overrun by a foreign foe. Those people know what war really means. Nobody on the Continent of Europe has to walk more than a certain number of miles to see a frontier, and to see on the other side of the frontier, men in a strange uniform, speaking a different language, and possibly potential enemies of his country. We have not
<col>428</col>
that here, and the people of this country have forgotten to all intents and purposes what war is like. War is a horrible thing even for a victorious army, but for that army it has its compensations in the fact of the glory and success of their cause. To the defeated army war is a much more horrible thing, although they may have the consolation of having done their duty and struggled against impossible odds. To the inhabitants of a country in which war takes place there are no words in our language that can adequately convey the appalling results. The Englishman is the one man in the whole of Europe who cannot defend his hearth and home, his wife and children, against a foreign foe; he is the only male creature in Europe that cannot do it. Not only can he not do it, but, according to the laws of warfare, if he attempts to do it he will be shot down by the foreign foe. It is because I feel so strongly the appalling results of even a temporarily successful raid that I urge most strongly on your Lordships that the moment has come when this country should take up the same burden that lies on every other country in the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00783"><member>VISCOUNT HAMPDEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, being an absolutely convinced believer in the necessity of some form of compulsion for home defence, I feel it my duty to say a few words in support of the principles of this Bill. I regret very much that I cannot follow the lead of the noble Marquess who told us that it would not be either to the credit of this House or of the country to vote for the Bill. I believe that this measure, or some such measure, would be for the good of the country. I wish, first of all, to approach this measure entirely from a military point of view. I think that most of your Lordships will agree with me that from military and naval questions Party element should be, if possible, eliminated. I do not lay any claim to expert opinion, but I have for a certain number of years served in the Regular Army both regimentally and on the Staff, and I have also been in the Volunteers, the Militia, and the Yeomanry, and for a short time in the Australian Horse, and I am now on the Staff of the Territorial Army. Therefore I think I may claim that at any rate I ought to have some military knowledge.<lb/>
The first thing we have to remember is that this problem of national service cannot
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0218"/>
<col>429</col>
be viewed by itself. We must take it in conjunction with all the difficult naval and military problems that are before the nation to-day. The first question we ought to ask ourselves is what are the duties of our sea and land forces. I think the answer is a very simple one. A short time ago we were given an excellent and concise description of our foreign policy. The duty of our land and sea forces is to make it absolutely certain that that policy can be carried out. I do not think that in present circumstances this result could be arrived at. The groundwork of the whole system is that we should be strong at our heart; that the heart of the Empire should be absolutely secure. Without that no schemes of defence are really sound. We hear a great deal in these days of Imperial general staffs and Imperial armies. I believe thoroughly in such things, but we are beginning at the wrong end. It is no good making your arms and your legs strong if the heart is not strong. You must begin at the right spot, and I believe that home defence is the groundwork of the whole thing. I notice that the same argument was used by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary for War, but with the difference that we arrive at exactly opposite conclusions. He thinks that by having a really strong home defence we kill our powers of offence. I think, on the contrary, that by having a really strong home defence we free our Fleets and allow our Expeditionary Force to be sent abroad.<lb/>
There is no question that the first line of defence is our Navy, but I would rather describe the Navy as the first line of Imperial defence than the first line of national defence. I think that the power which would be given to the Navy to be able to strike hard and to strike quickly would be a far greater asset than a mere increase of Dreadnoughts. It would be far better, and the interests of the peace of the world would be further increased by giving this power to our Navy. If other nations realised that we were able to use the instrument of our Navy in such a way the prospect of peace would be much greater. There is only one safe and sound way to insure the security of our homes and that is by personal sacrifice and personal service. I do not believe that is possible under a voluntary system. I understand that the position of noble Lords opposite is that a period of six months is going to be allowed us to train our Home Army on war being
<col>430</col>
declared. Of course that may be a good argument from a political point of view, but from a military point of view it is not an argument at all. It is simply an impossibility. The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, told us we should be taking a great responsibility if we passed this Bill against the opinion of the trusted advisers of His Majesty's Government, and he went on to say that if the Government told him, on the authority of their military advisers, that there was no prospect of meeting the needs of the situation under a voluntary system he would be prepared to vote for the Bill. A short time before he had described the position of affairs in 1900. He said the Expeditionary Force was then out of the country, and he added&#x2014;
<quote>"It would be no indiscretion on my part if I told you that my military advisers informed me that the position in this country was highly dangerous."</quote>
Why should we require any further information from the military advisers? Is the position in this country in the event of war any better to-day than it was ten years ago? The position in 1900 was highly dangerous, and if our Expeditionary Force were away from this country to-day the position would be even worse.<lb/>
The noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, said "Why don't you find out what the opinion of the people is?" Why should the people wish for national service? The leader of neither Party takes it up. Why should they wish to serve if they are not told they ought to serve? We often hear that there is an analogy between sport and war. We have had a very interesting lesson in the victory of the Americans at polo lately. In the friendly rivalry of sport these mistakes can be rectified, as this one no doubt will be rectified. But in the serious business of war a small mistake of this kind means the destruction of the Army. I am very strongly in favour of this system of compulsion, and shall certainly vote for the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00784"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not like to give a silent vote on an occasion like this. We have before us now the alternative of voting for the Second Reading of the Bill or for the Amendment of my noble friend the Duke of Northumberland&#x2014;the alternative of either expressing satisfaction with the present state of
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0219"/>
<col>431</col>
affairs as given by His Majesty's Government&#x2014;because I prefer to put the responsibility on the Government and not on their military advisers&#x2014;or of approving of the Bill brought in by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. I do not admit that in giving this vote for the Second Reading I am supporting all the details of the Bill, because some of them may need altering, but I feel that there is a principle involved in it in which I have the very strongest belief. That principle is that every man is bound to defend his own home.<lb/>
I think it is most essential that this measure should be brought forward now, because I do not think the people of this country realise the position they would be in if the country were invaded. Of course they say that if an invasion came they would all be ready to rise <i>en masse</i> and try to shoot anybody with any wretched gun they happened to have to scare crows with. The people of this country do not realise that that is not allowed in civilised warfare, and that under the laws of the civilised world the civilian who did that would be taken out and shot at his own garden gate. I hope and trust the National Service League will endeavour to make the truth known to every Englishman, and then there will be a very different view taken with regard to the necessity for some measure of this sort.<lb/>
I am very sorry to have to differ from the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, but he will, I know, give me credit for my strong belief in the principles I hold. It is not so much against the principles as against the details of the scheme that the critics carp. One thing which they, and especially the Under-Secretary of State for War, have attacked so much is that under the noble and gallant Earl's scheme of compulsory training there would be a perfectly inadequately trained force in the field. I think that is a condemnation of the training of the Territorial Forces by the Under-Secretary himself, because if, as he says, the four months training advocated in this Bill is not enough, how can he justify the training now allowed to the Territorial Forces? Still more do I feel myself justified in voting for the Bill of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, because, as the Under-Secretary himself said, the Territorial Forces are unable, without six months notice, to meet a foreign invasion. To my mind that does not
<col>432</col>
imply security to this country, and I think the sooner this country realises, as the Under-Secretary says, that the Territorial Forces without this extra training are not able to meet the enemy, the sooner will come the absolute necessity of some Bill like the present one.<lb/>
In saying this I hope it will not be for a moment thought that I am disparaging the work that is done by the Territorial Forces or their zeal. It is my pleasure and my pride to have been connected with the Yeomanry all my life, and I have been glad to see the way in which the Yeomanry has been recognised and the way it has come on. I do not quite agree with what was said by Lord Willoughby de Broke about the Yeomanry. I think an enormous change has come over it. There were, no doubt, a great many individually good men in the Yeomanry in the old days, but the Yeomanry as a whole was in a different position altogether from what it is now. I attribute the change a great deal to the longer Yeomanry training of the last few years. I hold that it is most essential for the training of men that you should have them in camp, where you can get hold of them, keep them thoroughly in hand, and teach them every detail. The men like it, and it is proper that it should be done. I most deeply regret the remarks of the noble Duke about young men of all classes being thrown together, and, although I do not think he meant it, I think it was rather an undeserved slur on the Army and the Yeomanry to say that a large number of recruits could not be brought together without doing harm.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00785"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: If that interpretation is put on my words, which I do not think is wholly justified, I ought to explain. I did not say one word, so far as I know, against the ordinary training that has hitherto been in vogue in the Yeomanry, Militia, and Volunteers, where you divide officers and men and look somewhat to the character of the men you enlist, and where you certainly do not take men entirely away from all their surroundings; I was speaking of a system under which there would be a hotch-potch of all classes and characters, who would be taken right away from their surroundings. You cannot expect that that would have no influence on the morals or conduct of those subjected to it.</membercontribution></p>

<col>433</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00786"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad to hear the noble Duke make that statement, because I am quite sure the last thing he would wish to do would be to disparage the Army. I hope he will not think me unkind for alluding to the matter and giving him the opportunity of denying any such intention. But what I do think with regard to this Bill is that it is absolutely essential that the whole country should realise the duties they have to do. As to what the noble Marquess has said with regard to compulsory powers never having been used, will he allow me to remind him that at the time of the South African war a Bill was brought into this House for making the Ballot Act compulsory, and I think the measure was introduced by the noble Marquess himself. As time went on, however, it was not deemed necessary to press the Bill, unfortunately, in my opinion, because I think that if it had been carried then a great deal of the present trouble would have been avoided, and we should have had in working order an Act which would give a sufficient number of men to defend this country.<lb/>
I do not think that at the present moment we have got, in spite of the zeal of the Territorial Force, sufficient men to repel an invasion. I cannot quite take the optimistic view of the noble Earl on the other side, that invasion is practically impossible. I am afraid nothing is impossible nowadays, and I am sure there would not be this general feeling all over the world if there were not a great deal in it. What I feel very strongly is this. Here we have a Bill recommended to us by the noble and gallant Earl, whose experience of war nobody can rival, and to whom the whole country looks as a great military adviser. We have from him the admission that the present state of defence of this country is not satisfactory. He proposes a remedy, and asks us to read this Bill a second time. Against that we have the political expediency of the present time, and I prefer to trust those who know what war and military defence is rather than the mere question of political expediency. I shall, therefore, have the greatest possible pleasure in giving my support to the Second Reading of the Bill, because I believe it will bring home to every Englishman the absolute necessity of enrolling himself in some force or other, so that whenever the time comes he may be able to defend his country. At any rate, I shall be free from the accusa-
<col>434</col>
tion that I, in my time, did not do something to prevent "Too late" being said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00787"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REDESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that my sympathies are entirely with the noble and gallant Earl who has introduced this Bill. The noble Field-Marshal speaks with an authority which is probably unique, and when he sounds a note of alarm it should not fall upon deaf ears. He spoke weighty words, doubtless with a full sense of the responsibility which rests upon him and which must attach to every utterance of his upon any military subject whatever. The question to my mind is simple. Are we at the present moment in the position of the strong man armed who keepeth his palace and whose goods are at peace? Is there no danger lest a stronger than we should come upon us and overcome us, taking from us the armour in which we trusted, and dividing our spoils?<lb/>
My Lords, the armaments of the whole world now are in such a condition that per, haps we stand in a worse position as regards our Army than we ever did before in the history of the nation. Great nations are arming in every direction, and even the smaller nations are turning their attention to military matters in a way they never did before. Even the countries which were known in the old days as the Danubian principalities have their great armies, and I am told on high authority that even Roumania has an army which, so far as its numbers go, is second to none. What can be the object of all these armaments? It is not for pleasure or amusement, it is not idly, that the countries of the world spend large sums upon these bloated armaments. To us they must be a danger. At the present moment we are happily on terms of friendship with the whole of the rest of the world. We hope that it may long be so. But friendship among nations is apt to be fickle. We had an instance of the suddenness with which war begins in 1870.<lb/>
It is no new matter this alarm of sudden invasion of this country. That great soldier, Lord Wolseley, speaking before a Committee of the House of Commons upwards of thirty years ago, foretold that the wars of the future would be quick in their inception, short in their duration, and woe be to those who were not prepared. The noble Duke in the speech in which he introduced his Amendment, foreshadowed a
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0221"/>
<col>435</col>
state of things in which it might be necessary for all men to take up arms for the defence of the country. He said that if the safety of the country depended upon universal service, that service must be given at whatever cost. It will be too late then, my Lords. We must be prepared beforehand. It is no use beginning to prepare when we are attacked. It will be too late unless, indeed, the country that proposed to attack us should have the considerate courtesy to give us six months notice of its intention.<lb/>
It was my luck some three years ago to see something of what perhaps is now one of the best and most formidable armies in the world. Of course, my opinion of that army was worth nothing, but I was in the company of those who were experts in military matters, and they were absolutely astonished&#x2014;taken aback&#x2014;by the perfection to which the Japanese Army had attained. At a place called Hiroshima a review was held in honour of Prince Arthur, and General Kelly-Kenny, who certainly must be regarded as an authority in such matters, told me he was quite astonished at the steadiness and the precision of the drill of the men he saw there. To my inexperienced eyes they seemed to be veterans. Yet these men had only joined the Colours in the month of December, and we were then in the early days of March. That shows what preparedness can do. Throughout Japan the whole of the schools have a system of physical drill which is probably second to none in the world. The boys, and even the girls, are drilled in such a manner that when the boys join the Regular Forces half their lesson has been learnt. The system which the Japanese have adopted for their army is based upon the German model. Service is compulsory. A man serves for the first three years continuously with the First Line. Then he has four years and four months in the Reserve&#x2014;two periods of service of sixty days each. Then comes the Second Line corresponding to the Landwehr, in which they have two trainings of sixty days. Then come two years and eight months in the Kokumin, which is the Home Defence Army, or Landsturm, completing twenty years service. In the Reserve, which is for making good the war waste, the men perform a service of seven years and four months, which means one training of ninety days and two trainings of sixty days each. They then enter into the Kobi, or Landwehr, for ten years, and finally into the
<col>436</col>
Kokumin for two years and eight months, making twenty years service.<lb/>
It is impossible to conceive an army which has been more scientifically organised or better prepared for war than that of Japan. During the few years which preceded their great war with Russia they were always prepared. Nothing was left to chance. Not only their fighting men but their medical staff, their nurses, their hospital staff, were brought to a pitch of perfection which made them ready to take the field at any moment. Every gun was numbered, with its carriage, ammunition, and transport, and was in an absolute state of readiness. Nothing was left to hazard. Even in such a small matter as lint, the ladies of Japan were engaged for many months in making piles of it for the hospitals. The consequence was that when the Japanese Army took the field it was in a state of preparedness such as probably no Army has previously enjoyed. Could this have been effected by any other means than compulsory service? I venture to think not. The feats which that Army performed are one of the marvels of the world's history.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, what do we who believe, at any rate, in the principle of conscription, ask? It may be extremely difficult, it may not be possible, for you to bring that principle into operation at once, but at any rate you can affirm the principle, which is so simple, so straightforward, so absolutely intelligible, that I cannot imagine any man objecting to it. It is simply the principle that every citizen should be ready, as he should be willing, to bear arms for the defence of his country. It is not sufficient that he should be willing. The most willing men in the world, if not drilled and trained, will simply hamper the action of the Generals. But if you have a system of national service you will have something which I venture to think is more valuable than any voluntary service that can be established by means of this Territorial Army or in any other way. Surely it is better to trust to the whole-trained manhood of the country than to any voluntary system whatever. Nay, more, is it absolutely impossible that these two systems should walk hand in hand? It seems to me that if you have the compulsory system you will have a bank upon which to draw cheques for your Regular Army and for your Territorials. You will have a great
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0222"/>
<col>437</col>
fund of military power in reserve which will make you formidable indeed. We have occupied, and thank heaven we still occupy, a very proud position among nations, but that position was won by the enthusiasm, perhaps I might say even the imprudences, of youth. If we lose that position it will be because we have allowed ourselves to sink into the decrepitude of a slothful old age. I hope that that day is far distant. I do not know whether your Lordships will give a Second Reading to this Bill, but I hope you will. Even if it should never become law, you will have asserted a great national principle. You will have asserted that it is the duty of the man to fight for his country, and that it is the duty of the country to teach the man to fight to the best advantage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00788"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have on this and on previous occasions derived a certain amount of mild enjoyment from observing the attitude taken up by noble Lords on the two Front Benches, first of all with regard to my noble and gallant friend Lord Roberts, and, secondly, with regard to the proposal which he advocates. I have observed that their estimate of my noble and gallant friend varies in the most extraordinary degree. When he is in agreement with the Government he is treated as a sort of military pontiff to doubt whose opinion is akin to blasphemy, but when he disagrees with the views of the Government he is airily dismissed as holding early Victorian notions, and those notions are consigned with other archaic opinions to that lumber-room which is supposed to exist in the political world.<lb/>
What I have observed with regard to the attitude of official politicians to these proposals is that behind the keen discomfort which is felt in having to form an opinion upon questions of this kind there has been equally keen anxiety on the part of both sides to fix responsibility for taking this step upon the other; but on this particular occasion there has been no cause for anxiety at all, because my noble friend has come forward to relieve them from taking any unpleasant action of that kind. In fact it has been quite unnecessary to indulge in that elaborate and solemn stage fight to which we are by this time so well-accustomed, when ex-Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries pound each other for hours together, it being understood that no real damage
<col>438</col>
is to be inflicted. In place of this theatrical combat we have witnessed noble Lords on the two Front Benches falling upon each other's necks. The Leader of the Opposition has been so warm indeed in his commendation of the Government's military policy that I have doubts whether he will ever be able to criticise it in an unfriendly manner in the future. And it is a matter of extreme pain and surprise to me&#x2014;in fact, it has inflicted a greater shock to my belief in human nature than I have ever experienced before&#x2014;that the Duke Of Northumberland should have come to the rescue and built for these embarrassed politicians a bridge by which they can simultaneously retreat. This is a profound shock to me, because I candidly admit that I have the most sincere admiration for my noble friend. I have always looked upon him as a singularly sane politician, and I have endeavoured to imbibe wisdom from his utterances. One thing which is impressed upon me more frequently than anything else is that whenever the two Front Benches are in agreement they are invariably wrong, and it is the duty of every right-minded man to vote against them.<lb/>
A word with regard to my noble friend's Amendment. I understand he rather resents the suggestion that this Amendment represents a vote of confidence in the Government; but, after all, the proof of an Amendment lies in the Division afterwards, and I gather that noble Lords opposite are going to vote with alacrity for the Amendment. How under the circumstances can the noble Duke pretend that it is otherwise than a vote of confidence in the Government? I understand he repudiates the idea of expressing confidence in the Government, but he desires to express confidence in His Majesty's military advisers. In my opinion that comes to exactly the same thing.</membercontribution></p>

advisers. These military advisers, I was about to observe, are a remarkable race of men. Every soldier I am acquainted with and nearly every officer in the Territorial Army is a pronounced adherent of our proposals. With regard to military advisers, it is an extraordinary thing that the Government are always able to obtain the services of gentlemen whose opinion can be quoted in their favour. I do not like to be disrespectful to these advisers, but they remind me in some respects of the class of officials who exist in Turkey and whose business it is to agree with their superiors. They are known as men who say "Yes." Without being disrespectful to members of the Army Council it does seem to me that it is the business of these gentlemen to say "ditto" to the Secretary for War, and they form a kind of human zareba, or fortification, into which the Secretary for War may retire when hardly pressed by his political opponents.<lb/>
In spite of the touching unanimity which has been shown by official politicians on both sides with regard to the beauties of the voluntary system I cannot help thinking that any impartial person who has followed the debate must realise that this most boasted system is almost on its last legs. Only a short time ago its great champion&#x2014;I was going to say that great blusterer&#x2014;the Secretary for War, announced that the nation was never so near conscription as it was last December. What saved the country from relapsing into this horrible conscription which inspires the official Opposition with horror? I am not exaggerating when I say that the collapse of the Territorial Army system was averted by a sensational play, and the remarkable thing is that the play was written by an innocent, simple-minded soldier who desired to advocate compulsory service. With almost superhuman ingenuity this was seized hold of by Lord Esher and the Secretary of State for War and converted into an advertisement of the Territorial Army. The noble Viscount and the Secretary for War sat in the stalls and recruited from the pit and gallery for their Army, with the assistance of anonymous benefactors and of the <i>Daily Mail.</i> I sometimes wonder whether the <i>Daily Mail</i> will not be authorised one of these days to issue a special decoration for the Territorial Forces. It seems to me obvious that it will be necessary to work up this hysteria again in four years time and get people to write sensational
<col>440</col>
plays or the equivalent, discover anonymous persons who will give large sums of money provided the Chancellor of the Exchequer permits their existence in this country, and utilise those means which usually commend themselves to advertisers of patent medicines and to circus proprietors in order to keep your numbers up. It is hoped that by means of these various devices the Territorial Force will amount some day to rather more than 300,000 men, but nobody but a Secretary for War has had the hardihood to maintain that 300,000 men represents what he is pleased to call a nation in arms. That number works out at something between 1/150th and 1/160th part of the population, and I do not think there is a man living with the exception of the Secretary of State for War who will take that fraction as representing a nation in arms. When it comes to the expansion which the right hon. gentleman claims to have obtained the numbers really are not any larger than the figures of a few years ago, and it is really much the same thing as if a man bought a new kind of cheque book and then said he was enormously richer whilst at the same time his balance at the bank remained the same.<lb/>
I am not going to waste your Lordships' time by going over the arguments. I only desire to summarise our objections to the Territorial Army as it exists at present. We consider that it is deficient in numbers and deficient in training. Anybody who suggests that the training of the Territorial Army is deficient, or who ventures to hint that because a Volunteer has been changed into a Territorial that therefore the man has not suddenly assumed all the military virtues, is looked upon as a sort of traitor, unfit to consort with ordinary human beings. One is rather apt to measure standards by oneself. Let me take my own case. Look at me. I am in my person a deplorable object lesson of the failure of the voluntary system, for, although I was for many years an officer in one of the Auxiliary Forces, passed through two special courses at Aldershot, rose to comparatively high rank, and was even reported upon favourably by simple-minded inspecting officers, some of whom I think I recognise here to-night., yet in spite of all this I know perfectly well in my own heart I was in a military sense a fraud. And I venture to make the admission that what influenced me chiefly in leaving the Yeomanry Force was
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0224"/>
<col>441</col>
not so much advancing years as the intuitive knowledge that I was unfit for high command. I cannot help thinking that, notwithstanding the change of name of the forces, there must be a number of people in the same position as I was in that respect.<lb/>
I must say that I agree with what I have heard expressed by some of the speakers to-night that, considering all things, the results we obtain under the voluntary system are quite extraordinary considering that the whole system, the whole theory, is built upon an evident fallacy&#x2014;the fallacy that all that is required to make a really efficient soldier is the amount of time which an ordinary individual can give without personal inconvenience to himself. That is the fallacy, and it is a fallacy which I have no hesitation in saying does not prevail in any country except this. Let me deal with one point, the point which is always dwelt upon as the crowning weakness of the Territorial Force&#x2014;namely, that the serious training for war is not to begin until hostilities have actually been declared. My own view is that it is hardly worth while attaching much importance to this particular point of view, because I am quite convinced that under a voluntary system no Government would ever venture to call out the Territorial Forces as a whole. I will give two reasons for it. In the first place there are a large number of gentlemen belonging to the Party opposite who, if we were involved in hostilities with another Power, would be most distinctly in favour of the other Power as against ourselves, and who would object to any preparation on our part as a kind of blood guiltiness. This is a minor objection. But the unanswerable objection which occurs to me is that under a voluntary system the calm proposal that you should ask a certain number of men to go out for an indefinite period whilst the great mass of the population do nothing at all is absolutely unthinkable, and I do not believe any Government would ever do anything of the kind.<lb/>
One thing has impreessd me very much in this debate&#x2014;I refer to the speeches made by noble Lords upon the Back Benches who are now serving either in the Territorial Force or in the Special Reserve. Those are the men who are honestly doing their best to make your scheme a success,
<col>442</col>
and who come here and tell you in all honesty that they cannot do it without compulsion. Their plain and unvarnished tale carries a great deal more weight with me than do the more elaborate utterances of more distinguished persons. In the course of this debate we have had many culogies pronounced on the voluntary system. The noble Earl the Leader of the House is so fanatical an admirer of the voluntary system that he actually posed this afternoon as the defender of class and privilege. He objected to everybody being treated alike&#x2014;a somewhat curious position for a leading Liberal politician.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00791"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was not objecting to people being treated alike. I said that there were a very large number of people in this country who objected to being treated alike. That is a very different thing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00792"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: The impression made upon me by the noble Earl's speech was that he objected very much to the idea of what he called "riff-raff" being associated with the middle classes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00793"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00794"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl repudiates it, of course I accept his repudiation. We have had an even stronger eulogy from the Under-Secretary of State for War. But the Under-Secretary is a pronounced optimist. I rather think he undertook last year to turn out a first-rate horse artillery battery in a week provided he were given intelligent civilians. We had an almost equally enthusiastic eulogy from the noble Lord, Lord Pentland. For my part I can see no beauty whatever in the voluntary system when it is applied to home defence. What is it, when you look at it sanely and calmly, but a sort of conspiracy on the part of nine men to induce the tenth man to do the duty which they ought to do themselves, and which they probably would be much better for doing.<lb/>
What I detest more than anything else about the voluntary system is the hypocritical, nauseating appeal which is constantly being made to employers of labour to come forward and save the situation. Why should the employer of labour be more liable for the defence of his country than anybody else? That is, I know, the view of the Socialists. The
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0225"/>
<col>443</col>
Socialists are quite logical people. They hold that nobody except a capitalist or an employer of labour has got anything worth protecting, and that therefore capitalists and employers of labour ought to do the fighting. But the Government is not Socialist yet in name whatever it may be in practice, and I should like to know what arguments can be advanced in favour of, say, a colliery proprietor, or a railway director, or anybody of that kind being penalised for the purpose of defending his country rather than, let us say, a stockbroker, or an artist, or a dentist, or anybody you like to think of who employs next to no labour at all.<lb/>
The duty of national defence is not the duty of a particular class. It is the duty of the community, and I do not think it is any argument to say that employers of labour ought to take Governments and public bodies as their examples. The Government if they choose, can make it a condition of labour that their <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> should enter the Territorial Army. The Government have got the taxpayer behind them, and local authorities have got the ratepayer behind them. There is no sacrifice whatever involved in the practice in their case. But when it comes to asking an employer of labour to go and do this work, then you are deliberately asking a man to penalise himself. It is a contemptible practice which prevails only in this country, and I wonder we are not heartily ashamed of it by this time.<lb/>
Two years ago I went on a sort of pilgrimage with my noble friend Lord Ampthill to Switzerland in order to follow the Switzerland man&#x0153;uvres. We were accompanied by a large number of gentlemen, some of whom were Liberal Members of Parliament, some of whom were Labour Members of Parliament, and some of whom were Socialists. Many of them spent their time quite ineffectually in endeavouring to discover some objection to the system of compulsory service prevailing in Switzerland. We inquired into this question and the effect upon employment. According to noble Lords opposite, if a young man in this country is taking four months military training it will create the most fearful havoc in British industries. The conclusion to which we came, after inquiring into the matter, was that there were no objections whatever on the part of either employers or men. As a matter of fact
<col>444</col>
both had been, so to speak, through the mill, both regarded it as a perfectly fair thing, and there was no complaint of any kind. But they said&#x2014;
<quote>"If this were optional, and if one employer were called upon to send out his men in order that somebody else might escape, we should consider that a gross injustice, and it is not a thing we should agree to at all."</quote>
That was one of the lessons which we learned from the pilgrimage. But we learned something else besides. We realised not only the extraordinary patriotism which prevails in Switzerland, but we were able to realise the equally remarkable pride, and, I might almost say, affection which is felt by a free people in a really national force, a feeling which I venture to think does not exist in this country. I must say that, although I am not of a particularly sentimental disposition, when, at the conclusion of those man&#x0153;uvres, I saw thousands of these unassuming-looking men in their unpretending uniforms marching past, it crossed my mind that this, perhaps, in its way, was a finer and a nobler spectacle than the more gorgeous military pageants to which we are accustomed in this country, and an equally uncomfortable thought crossed my mind that if it were ever our fate to have to contend with a Power more or less equal to our own, victory was hardly likely to rest with the country which put its faith in money and machinery rather than depended upon the higher ideals of national sacrifice and personal responsibility.<lb/>
I have only one word to add. I feel some small measure of responsibility for this debate, because it was at my instigation that our proposals were put into this Bill and brought before your Lordships' House; and I would venture to make a very respectful, but, at the same time, earnest, appeal to all who are in favour of this principle, not to be dissuaded from giving their vote in support of it in consequence of what has fallen from the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. We have many times been challenged to put our proposals before you. It has now been done. They are now before you in a concrete shape, and you are asked to vote for the principle. This is not a Party question, but until we are in earnest and until we really show what we want neither Party is going to take up this question. This is a unique opportunity. This is an
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0226"/>
<col>445</col>
opportunity, I venture to say with great submission, on which noble Lords might well decide the question for themselves, and vote in accordance with their convictions. When my noble friends say that the country is not ready for this great change, and that if we pass this Bill it may create a prejudicial feeling in the country, I cannot help feeling that if we are really to gain the esteem of the country we shall be more likely to do it by voting independently upon this great question rather than by waiting for a mandate which may possibly never arrive at all, or which, even if it does arrive, may arrive too late.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00795"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Lord Ampthill said he regarded this Bill as being a reconnaissance in force. It is a reconnaissance in force on the part of those whom we may term the rank and file, or the men in the street; and I do not think that noble Lords sitting on the Front Benches are quite entitled to decide a matter which is really of a non-party character. But there have been very few noble Lords who have really endorsed the Bill as a Bill, though they have approved of the general principle; and we can hardly expect either Front Bench to commit themselves to a Bill which does not meet with their approval or with the general approval of the House. I think the two objects which the noble Lord, Lord Newton, said this Bill proposed to effect were, first, to secure that those who are serving in the Territorial Force, or who would have to serve, should have more efficient training; and, secondly, that there should be a greater supply of men. I quite agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Milner, who said you cannot expect men to continue year after year so zealously engaging in military duties. You cannot expect those who are now in the Territorial Force to give up so much time, and to sacrifice, perhaps, so much of their money, whilst the rest of the population do nothing to secure the defence of the country. As an officer in the Territorial Force I believe that that is very true, and also that the training is undoubtedly insufficient. I do not see how we are to get a longer period of training except by some form of compulsion.<lb/>
There is one point which those who are the advocates of this Bill seem to have lost sight of, and that is the great diffi-
<col>446</col>
culty of enforcing any compulsory system. It means an absolute change in the whole social life of our country. It means that you must put every man under police supervision. Anybody who has resided for any length of time on the Continent recognises the truth of what I say. A man would not be free to wander about this country in the course of his employment. Every time he did so he would have to leave his address. That means a revolution in our social system. Therefore I see great difficulty in enforcing any such principle as is now advocated. Some less stringent process would probably meet with greater success, to start with at all events. Hence I was very much impressed by the speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and was also very glad to hear&#x2014;and I think those who are responsible for this measure may take credit to themselves for getting such a strong pronouncement&#x2014;that he does advocate some form of compulsory training for youths; that there should be some training given to the youth of this country. As being the least complicated system I suggest that no man should be allowed to exercise the franchise without having passed through some compulsory service, of course with the necessary exemptions extended in every country, such as for weakness of health and other reasons.<lb/>
I gladly associate myself with the noble Viscount, Lord Milner, in being a total disbeliever in any idea of invasion at the present time. I think if we really feared that a great powerful Continental nation was strengthening itself with the idea of invading this country, no Government, however little we might think of them, would allow for a moment that Power to be increasing in strength day by day without having taken some step to prevent that growth of strength. But what I am anxious to see is a prevention of the scares and the state of panic that this country is liable to get into. I regard it as vitiating our foreign policy in different parts of the world, and to it is largely due our weakness at the present time and what is going on in Persia. Absolute believer as I am in the strength, both political and military, of the Empire as a whole, I recognise that the people of this country are in a state more or less of scare or panic and will not be assured until they feel their shores are properly defended. The Secretary of State for the Colonies mentioned as a paradox
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0227"/>
<col>447</col>
that we on this side are always declaiming against State intervention in every department of life. We say that the first department in life in which every citizen should be interested is the defence of his country, and although other instances of State interference in the various activities of life are offensive and harmful, nobody can deny that in this case it is absolutely essential for the good and prosperity of this country. In the past it has been said that property has its duties as well as its rights. In these more advanced days surely we can say that democracy also has its duties as well as its rights. We who support this Bill believe that the democracy will be only too anxious, when it is put before them, to accept responsibility for the exercise of their duties in the defence of their country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00796"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I desire to pay my tribute of sincere admiration to the astuteness with which this Bill has been recommended in the speeches of its supporters. I welcome the Bill. We have been waiting for this Bill a long time. The National Service League has been active for years, and it has been very difficult indeed for anybody who desired to criticise the League to realise effectively what the League was formed to advocate. If ever you quoted a speech of one member of the National Service League to another member of the League my experience has been that he invariably repudiated the opinion that that speech expressed. But here for the first time we have a definite proposition made in the Bill. This, I take it, is in future to be regarded as the official propaganda of the National Service League, and as such it will doubtless very often receive examination in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
But I do complain that hardly any advocate of the Bill who has addressed us in the course of this debate told us anything about the Bill at all. The noble Lord, Lord Newton, summarised his highly entertaining and delightful speech in one sentence. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am going to summarise my objections to the Territorial Army."</quote>
The noble Lord's speech was a continual stream of criticism formed upon the Territorial Army. He made no attempt to prove that the proper remedy for the evils which he believes exist in the Territorial Army is to be found in this Bill. I think my noble
<col>448</col>
friend was extremely wise to follow the course he took. Destructive criticism is always far easier than the defence of creation, and nowhere is that seen more often than in connection with the War Office.<lb/>
The noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, evidently recognised from the first that it was desirable that there should not be too close examination of the provisions of this Bill, and he furnished an extremely astute excuse for avoiding that criticism. He said they all recognised that in the present state of affairs, quite apart from the merits of the Bill, it was impossible for it to pass into law, and therefore he suggested that it was desirable that we should discuss the general question and not trouble very much about the details of the scheme now before us. I wish to remind your Lordships as earnestly as I can that it is impossible to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill without approving, not only the principle underlying it, but also the details of the scheme which is to be found in its pages.<lb/>
We are not discussing a general principle such as we have often had to discuss in the course of the last four or five years. We are discussing definite proposals, put forward on the very, highest authority, that deal with evils which noble Lords who support the Bill evidently believe exist in far greater intensity than we believe they exist. But, however that may be, every vote given for the Second Reading of this Bill is a vote not only for the provisions of the Bill, but in favour of the system which the Bill itself sets out. That being so, I think an obligation lay upon the promoters of the Bill to prove to us three things. They should have proved that the country desired this change, that some such change is necessary, and that, some such change being necessary, the provisions in the Bill provide a system which will constitute the best change that could be made under the circumstances.<lb/>
My noble friend Viscount Midleton, at the very beginning of his speech, threw out a challenge. He challenged noble Lords to deal with the first of those questions&#x2014;the question as to whether there is any demand in this country for a Bill of this kind; and your Lordships will have noticed that except for the reference by the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, that challenge, like most of the challenges in the speech of my noble friend, has been absolutely
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0228"/>
<col>449</col>
ignored. Lord Ampthill, if he will permit me to say so, gave the usual reply, "but the country have never been asked." It is true that the country has never been definitely asked in the form of a referendum or of a general election. This question on the whole, perhaps, like the question of invasion, has to be decided on the opinion of experts; that is to say, on the opinion of people who are in closer touch with the constituencies than we are. But there have been slight indications that might help us to judge, and I think noble Lords, if they had liked, could have given us more opportunities of judging. Why do you not give us a few more National Service League by-elections? Why not give us a few more by-elections like Stratford-on-Avon? In Stratford-on-Avon there was a candidate who adopted from beginning to end the programme of the National Service League. It is true it was repudiated by the League, and I am quite ready to argue with noble Lords as to whether that repudiation did not do him more good than harm. The fact remains that there was a by-election fought on the programme of the League.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00797"><member>LORD REDESDALE</member><membercontribution>: The Stratford-on-Avon election was really fought on Tariff Reform.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00798"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I was going to say so, but the fact remains that there was one candidate who had nothing whatever to do with Tariff Reform or Free Trade&#x2014;the candidate who adopted the programme of the National Service League, he obtained five and a-half per cent. of the support of the electorate who went to the poll, although the noble Earl, Lord Roberts, and the noble Viscount, Lord Milner, gave him the benefit of their moral support. I think it would be too much to throw in the face of noble Lords the fact that Captain Kincaid-Smith did not win that election, but not too much to say that if there had been any great 'weight of opinion behind the National Service League, he might have been expected to get more than five and a-half per cent. of the support of the voters who went to the poll. Whether noble Lords dislike that reference or not, the fact remains that my main proposition is established. No attempt whatever has been made in this debate to prove to us conclusively that the country desires some such change as this Bill would bring about.<lb/>
<col>450</col>
The obligation certainly lay upon noble Lords to prove to us that some change is necessary, and here I admit that Lord Newton did keep within the requirements of the debate. Here I may say that these debates illustrate how nothing exceeds the contempt of a person who advocates compulsory service for a person who does not advocate it. Noble Lords who advocate compulsory service claim, of course, a monopoly of patriotism. We are unpatriotic because we oppose it. [A NOBLE LORD: No, no.] I am very glad to hear that contradiction from one quarter of the House, but I did not notice it coming from the headquarters of the League just behind me. It is obvious. We have had scores of these debates in the last four or five years, and I ask your Lordships, Have you ever heard any statement made by an opponent of compulsory service, or conscription, as I prefer to call it, when there has not been an audible growl of dissent from Lord Newton? There has certainly been a continuous series of these audible growls during the present debate. I am not in the least complaining. I have now got well accustomed to these growls, and should miss them if they were absent. But they do illustrate the fact that there has been a cock-sureness, in the course of these discussions, as to the necessity for some change, which I do not think treats us quite fairly because noble Lords who express that cock-sureness do not trouble us as we should like to be troubled with detailed argument.<lb/>
I desire to refer for a moment to one remark that was made by the noble Viscount on the Cross Benches who initiated the discussion this afternoon. I do hold strongly to the view that we must look to the Navy as our first line of home defence. But I do not think it is fair to represent those who hold that view as desiring anything that would have the effect of crippling the Navy by turning it into a coastguard," as the noble Viscount said. I entirely concur that we must do no such thing. So far as I know nobody has ever suggested that we should. But I think the mere fact that those remarks can be made show that noble Lords do not fully realise what we mean when we say that we desire to look to the Navy as our first line of defence.<lb/>
I hesitate to go into this argument very deeply. It is an argument that would be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0229"/>
<col>451</col>
much better expressed by some naval expert, but unfortunately we are not in the position of having any naval experts to take part in these debates. But noble Lords seem to think that the only way of defending the country through the medium of the Navy is to have the Navy in a string, so to speak, right around our coasts. They seem to forget that the Navy is not a single unit but that it is rather a conglomeration of very different units. Nobody expects our battleships to lie in a row around our coasts waiting to be attacked. It is obvious that our line-of-battle Fleet must be expected to go wherever the enemy is, and to search out the enemy's Fleet and to sink it at the very first opportunity. I submit that that in no way minimises their effect upon the problem of home defence, because, even with the battleship Fleet away, occupied, as I assume it should be occupied, with the battleships of the enemy, there is no reason why the duty of dealing with the transports in which an invader might be expected to come should be in any way neglected. That duty might safely be left to the cruisers, torpedo boat destroyers, and submarines told off for that particular purpose. As I have said, nobody expects our battleships to lie in a row around our shores waiting to be attacked. They must go and seek out the enemy's Fleet, and those auxiliaries to which I have alluded can safely be depended upon to deal with an unconvoyed fleet of transports. We had many proofs of this in the recent Russo-Japanese war. A noble Lord said he could not admit that it was a primary duty of the Fleet to defend our shores. I agree with the bald sense in which that statement is made. The primary duty of the Fleet is to maintain the unquestionable command of the sea, and if that unquestionable command of the sea is maintained the subsidiary duties of the Fleet are performed at the same time.<lb/>
Noble Lords who intend to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill must, in order to make their case, believe in the danger of invasion, not merely of a raid, but of serious invasion. It has not yet been explained in the course of the debate how far the scheme in the Bill would provide a system equal to dealing with the danger of a serious invasion. Is it a complete scheme? Has it been carefully thought out in all its aspects, or even in all its military aspects? The noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, asked the question, "What will you do with the
<col>452</col>
passive resister?" and that question was not answered. The noble Earl, Lord Crewe, and the noble Marquess behind me, asked what you are going to do about Ireland, and no answer has been vouchsafed to that question. I hesitate to think what the answer can possibly be. The scheme depends upon the Territorial system, and whoever drafted this Bill seems to have forgotten that the Territorial Army system does not apply to Ireland. It would be absolutely necessary, if you started this system in Ireland, to institute county associations there, and I should like to know from members of the National Service League whom they would find to be members of those associations. I am quite certain they would be extremely stormy bodies, and I should myself, without hesitation, follow the lead already given by my noble friend Lord Newton and carefully abstain from joining any association in the neighbourhood where I live.<lb/>
Has the cost of this scheme been carefully thought out? I do not desire to enter into details as to the question of cost, but I desire to repudiate one suggestion made by the noble Viscount who spoke first this afternoon upon the subject. He said that an argument used by the Under-Secretary of State for War affected only the estimate of the promoters of the Bill, and did not affect the Bill. I desire to repudiate that suggestion. If the argument is good against the estimate it is obviously equally good against the Bill. You cannot dissociate the estimate from the Bill, at least if the estimate is correct. But I do not, as I have said, wish to go into details with regard to this question of cost. I only desire to make one protest against what Lord Ampthill said in regard to the War Office estimate. In comparing the two estimates, those of the War Office and the National Service League, he said one thing which I heard with the very greatest regret. Referring to the officials at the War Office who prepared this estimate the noble Lord said that their brief was to make the estimate as near &#x00A3;20,000,000 as possible.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0002P0I0230"/>
<col>453</col>
official at the War Office who prepares these estimates. I know that Mr. Harris is incapable of cheating in the way the noble Lord has suggested. He is a very high principled, a very able, and a very devoted public servant, and if he were asked to produce an estimate he would produce one which was low or high according as he found the facts warranted, and nothing in the world would induce him even to colour an estimate he was preparing. I think the suggestion that such a thing is possible by any public servant is most unfortunate, and with my special knowledge of the facts of the particular case I thought I should be failing in my duty if I allowed that remark of the noble Lord to pass without my most earnest protest.<lb/>
I was asking questions about this scheme. Is the scheme a complete one? Has it been thought out? My noble friend Lord Midleton asked another question, "Will this scheme endanger recruiting for the Regular Army?" and my noble friend Lord Ampthill again gave what I may call with all respect, the stock answer that once give men a taste of the Army in some form or another and a great many of them will accept it in another form. It is not necessary for me to go into that because it has already been answered by Lord Midleton. The experience of the three years enlistment showed conclusively that if you give men an experience of the Army at home the unfortunate result is that the vast majority of them do not show that alacrity to extend their services and to go abroad as it was hoped they would.<lb/>
I can only see one way in which the danger of doing harm to recruiting for the Regular Army can be avoided. It is quite true that a great many recruits, as many of your Lordships have often complained, used to be got for the Militia by a system roughly described on several occasions as the dep&#x00F4;t press gang&#x2014;that system under which in a dep&#x00F4;t the lot of the Militiaman was made so uncomfortable as compared with the lot of the Line man that a great many of them were encouraged to join the Line with the greatest alacrity. It was a system which in my opinion had a great deal to do with bleeding the Militia to death. It is quite true that under the scheme which the Bill proposes you might extend that depot press gang system and so benefit recruiting for the Line. You could make
<col>454</col>
it very much less pleasant for the conscript under your Bill as compared with the comfort given to the long service soldier who enlists in the Regular Army, and so you could counteract what I believe, especially after the experience we have had of the three years enlistment, would be the great difficulty in getting recruits for the Line as a result of this system. That that could be done where it is desirable that it should be done is, I think, a very moot point, and I should regret very much if any such expedient as that were called for by any system approved by your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I know I may be told that these are questions of detail, and that we have been asked to discuss this matter on the ground of principle. Very well, my Lords, let us discuss it on the ground of principle, and let us give our votes on that ground. What are the principles, for there are more than one, that underlie this Bill? In order to vote for this Bill you have first to accept the principle that invasion is possible in spite of our Navy. Secondly, you have to accept the principle that to meet such an invasion compulsion is necessary. I do not admit either of those two principles; but let us admit them for the sake of argument. If you accept those two principles, you have also to accept a third one, which is that four months training is required for the condition of affairs which the Bill presupposes. Now, as I have said, the Bill presupposes that serious invasion is possible, and I submit to your Lordships that, if that is so, we must be prepared to resist it with troops every bit as efficient as those which would take part in the invasion. This Bill presupposes an invasion by picked troops from the Continent&#x2014;I do not care what country they come from&#x2014;who will have had at least two years service with the colours, and against those picked troops this Bill tells us it is sufficient to put conscript soldiers with four months training. That is the third underlying principle in this Bill, and in order to vote for the Second Reading you have to accept it. Has any soldier ever said that troops who had received four months training would be fit to meet troops who had had two years training? It is not necessary to trouble your Lordships with quotations, but I have quotations from almost every soldier of distinction who has held office in the British Army in the last ten years, and every one of them says that at least a
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0231"/>
<col>455</col>
year, and most of them say two years, is necessary in order to prepare British troops to fight on equal terms with Continental troops.<lb/>
I think the only Member of your Lordships' House intending to vote for this Bill who dealt with this point was the noble and gallant Field-Marshal who is fathering the Bill, and I am bound to say that he treated it extremely gingerly. He explained to us why he had agreed to this four months training. I understood that he agreed to this short period for two reasons&#x2014;first, because he thinks it is best suited to the country; and, secondly, because his connection with the City Imperial Volunteers convinced him that men of intelligence could be made good soldiers in four months. That opinion expressed by the noble and gallant Earl was a revelation to me. I have been looking up lately the evidence which Lord Roberts himself gave before Lord Elgin's Commission, and there I find almost the same words used in order to justify a training of two years, or, in some very special cases, one year. Will the House allow me to read what the noble and gallant Earl said? I quote it <i>in extensor</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"Question 13,160. SIR GEORGE GOLDIE: What would you put as the shortest time in which an Infantry soldier could be really trained under severe discipline?&#x2014;LORD ROBERTS: It depends. In a conscript army like the German Army two years are considered enough. We think it requires three years with the ordinary class of recruit.</quote>
<quote>"Q. And in France it is one year?&#x2014;A. I think those are Volunteers.</quote>
<quote>"In France they have one year to enable them to pass the examination?&#x2014;A. Yes, for educated people. That makes all the difference. If we had conscription or educated troops to deal with one year's training would suffice."</quote>
In reply to Question 13,290, Lord Roberts said&#x2014;
<quote>"If I had a thousand well-educated men of the stamp of the C.I.V.'s I think in one year I could be quite satisfied that they would be thoroughly well trained. If I had the ordinary recruit I should say he wanted two or three years. Education and intelligence make all the difference in the world to my mind."</quote>
Well, my Lords, that opinion I have always accepted as one of the cardinal canons of military training, and I have the gravest difficulty in deciding which to follow&#x2014;the opinion of the noble and gallant Earl as Commander-in-chief, supported by unanimous military opinion, or the opinion of the noble and gallant Earl the advocate of four months training and the father of this
<col>456</col>
Bill. I confess that with the weight of military opinion the other way I feel the very greatest difficulty in believing that anybody, granting the danger of invasion in large force by efficient foreign troops, can maintain that four months training, as proposed under this Bill, is adequate. This, then, is the position in which we find ourselves. As I have said before, we are not now concerned with pious opinions, or with a general discussion. We are concerned with concrete proposals. We have no proof of a desire for them by the public. We have had little or no attempt to prove that the system is necessary. We have proof that the scheme is unthought out and that it provides a system of training almost in the teeth of expert opinion. I think it would be a lamentable thing if your Lordships approved of any scheme on any such subject under such circumstances, and never more lamentable than when that scheme refers to the defence of the nation.</membercontribution></p>

As everyone knows, even Governments have voted in the House of Commons over and over again for the Second Reading of a Bill while carefully dissociating themselves from any approval of a large number of its details. I do not mean to repudiate the details of the Bill now before us. I only mention the matter in the hope that none
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0232"/>
<col>457</col>
of your Lordships who are in favour of the principle of compulsory service will be prevented, by the kind of argument to which I have referred, from giving on the first occasion open to you your approbation to the general principle on which it is founded.<lb/>
The advocates of this Bill have been attended, if I may say so, by some disadvantage in this debate. In the first place, we have had against us the combined authority, I might say at times even the tender embraces, of the two Front Benches. The Bench opposite has had behind it all the departmental knowledge and information always at the disposal of the Government of the day, and on this side, in spite of what the noble Marquess so graciously said early in the evening, there has been the silent pressure of the official whip. Over and over again we have been confronted with the opinion of the military advisers of the Government. I do not desire to speak with the slightest disrespect of that opinion, but I venture to say that there is an increasing and an undesirable tendency in our public life to shelter our selves and to shelter the Government behind the opinion of the military advisers. The responsibility rests not with the military advisers but with the Government, which acts or declines to act on their advice. For my own part, I am not much impressed by the factor of military opinion, because in my own experience it has not been always a consistent, and it is sometimes a malleable, factor. I am not quite certain that its malleability is not sometimes in direct ratio to the opinions of the Government which it serves. Anyhow, as has already been pointed out to-day, it is frequently contradictory in character, and when we are confronted, as we have been over and over again in this debate, with the alleged opinions of the military advisers of the Government, is it not open to us to reply that we have behind us the opinion of a commander who may legitimately be called the military adviser, not of the Government, but of the nation? I do not envy the courage or the optimism of the man&#x2014;I doubt if any such exists in your Lordships' House&#x2014;who can ignore the warnings which have on so many occasions been addressed to us by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, speaking with an authority and experience greater than that of any commander during the last half century of our history, and detached to a degree
<col>458</col>
unparalleled in our public life from the slightest suspicion of personal or Party feeling or prejudice.<lb/>
Although I shall incur the sharp disapproval of the noble Earl who has just spoken, I avow myself an unhesitating advocate of national service. I believe that the case for it is not one that will arise only in the dim and distant future, but that it exists now. Until some such system has been adopted by the people of this country I believe that our national integrity and the safety of our shores cannot be secured. With the tremendous armaments that are now being developed by great Powers, with their navies increasing in a ratio, equal, if not superior, to our own, I say that the integrity of this country cannot be permanently insured under the voluntary system. I cordially accept what the noble Earl opposite described as the honourable platitude that every able-bodied man is bound in the last resort to assist in the defence of his country. But I should like to amend that proposition and to say that every man should regard it as his duty, not in the last resort but in the first resort, and that if he is not prepared to undertake it&#x2014;and in this idle and self-indulgent age, it is too much to expect that the burden, will be voluntarily borne&#x2014;there is no resort but compulsion, and if compulsion is carried sooner or later, as I hope it may be, I cannot for my own part doubt that the nation will reap enormous benefits in every department of public, civic, and social life and action.<lb/>
There is one thing which I think has perhaps been insufficiently recognised in this debate, and that is the great change of opinion that is proceeding with regard to this matter. I think there have been not insignificant symptoms of it in this discussion itself. I do not know how many of your Lordships are going to follow us in the Division Lobby. I hope it will be a goodly muster, but anyhow we cannot forget the fact that last night we had two right reverend Prelates for the first time pronouncing definitely on the side of compulsory military training&#x2014;not in any spirit of military ardour, but with due regard to those necessities of the moral and physical welfare of the people which are specially committed to their charge. But this change in the House itself is nothing to the change which is taking place outside. This question is being debated
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0233"/>
<col>459</col>
and discussed everywhere in this country. I do not venture to say what is the opinion of the man in the street&#x2014;that mysterious and inscrutable phenomenon who is always brought up to support policies and measures which are in need of it; but whatever may be the attitude of the man in the street, the man in the railway carriage, who represents, perhaps, rather a superior grade of society and intelligence, is, if I may judge from my own experience, becoming an increasing convert to these proposals. Several leading organs of the Press are in its favour. Eminent writers and thinkers, strongly tinctured with Radical views, write letters to <i>The Times</i> and announce their conversion. You have Labour Members of Parliament openly expressing their advocacy. Across the seas you observe great democratic communities of our own race voluntarily bending their minds to the idea of compulsory citizen service. Everywhere people are beginning to ask themselves the question, "Why should we be the only great Power in the world to dispense with a system which is found so indispensable by our neighbours?" And still more are they asking the question, "Is our present Army, about which we hear so much, adequate to guarantee the safety and integrity of our homes?"<lb/>
My Lords, another factor has been introduced into the case to which the noble Marquess, with his habitual fairness, alluded to-night. Surely an immense change has been produced in the situation, and an immense impression has been left upon the mind of the people, by the discovery that our naval supremacy, hitherto a matter of such complete reliance, even if it still continues to exist, is no longer unchallenged, and that if measures are not taken to maintain it&#x2014;and there seems a strange reluctance about taking some of those measures&#x2014;it may in no short time slip away from our grasp. When, therefore, we are told, as we have been told over and over again in this debate, that the country is unalterably opposed to these proposals, that they conflict with the liberty-loving instincts and inclinations of the British people, I take leave to doubt that statement altogether. I believe the wish is father to the thought. For my own part I am inclined to believe that there is an enormous reserve of patriotic ardour and a keen sense of national duty amongst our people. I doubt very much if the Under-Secretary would have been in a position
<col>460</col>
last night to offer that beautiful panegyric upon the labours of his chief if Mr. Haldane had not been able to appeal to this patriotism. To my mind the attitude of the people of this country, if one can form an opinion about it at the present moment, is not one of hostility or alarm but one of hesitancy, of expectation, of waiting to see what its leaders will say and do. There is the noble and gallant Earl. He is not afraid to lead, but in the political custom of this country it is from politicians that the lead has to come; and in my view the moment the politicians make up their mind on this matter and give the lead&#x2014;although I do not detect many symptoms of it to-night&#x2014;the country will be ready to follow, and opinion will mature upon the question of national service with a rapidity which you can now hardly conceive.<lb/>
The noble Earl who preceded me very rightly pointed to the fact that the real pivot of this debate is the question of invasion. That question, somewhat ignored yesterday, has very properly come to the front this evening and it is upon the whole question of invasion and our capacity to meet it that our case depends. We have in this country for so long been immune from anything like invasion that the whole thing is unintelligible to us. I have no desire to paint any lurid picture of what invasion might mean, but yet I think when we talk about it your. Lordships ought to realise that supposing our Fleet were disabled or destroyed, and supposing an invading force of any considerable number were to effect a lodgment on our shores, the consequences to this country would be such as we can scarcely imagine or describe. An enemy with his hold upon this capital would be able to exact what indemnity and to impose what conditions he chose, to disable our dockyards and arsenals for years to come, and to cripple the whole future development of our Fleet. Then think, too, in a country of old and ordered civilisation like this what would happen, if the forces of crime and disorder were suddenly unchained. The successful invasion of this country would mean not only the destruction of all our material resources but the crumbling and collapse of society itself. It would mean the utter subversion of the old order of things to which we are accustomed.<lb/>
The question is, of course, Is there any
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0234"/>
<col>461</col>
risk of such a contingency? On this point also public opinion has sensibly advanced. Ten or twelve years ago we were in what may be described as the Dinghy period, the time when the popular belief was that even a boat's crew of the enemy could not be landed on the shores of our country. Then we passed to the period of what I may describe as the petty-raid period, when the idea was that the utmost we might have to meet would be a sharp and sudden incursion of 5,000 or 10,000 men. But we have advanced since then. We now hear statesmen and spokesmen of the Government talking about a contingency in which a force of 70,000 men or more may have to be contemplated, and there are&#x2014;the noble and gallant Earl and other military authorities in this House will correct me if I am wrong &#x2014;great military authorities both in this country and in the intelligence departments of foreign countries who believe that it would be a perfectly easy thing for a particular foreign Power, possessed as it is of great resources in the shape of railways, quays, transports, and other appliances, provided it could only secure uninterrupted command of the sea for seventy-two hours, to land a force of 150,000 soldiers on our shores.<lb/>
Lord Crewe in his speech to-night, without denying this proposition, took consolation from the fact that in 1857, the year of the Mutiny, and in 1900, the year of the Boer war, when this country was relatively helpless and when its Army was engaged in foreign parts, no advantage was taken of this position by our rivals and enemies; and his argument was that if we were thus generously treated before we might hope to be so treated again. I am not certain that in 1900 there were not those who, if they had been able to carry out their desires, might have made such an attempt as that to which the noble Earl alludes; but, whether that be so or not, surely the great difference in the position is this, that on all previous occasions our Navy has held the incontestable command of the sea. That position is at an end, and do you mean to say that on a future occasion, whether you are having a Mutiny in India or a war in South Africa or anywhere else, your enemies, if you have enemies, possessing as they do military forces incomparably superior to your own and a fleet which may even exceed your own, are going in a spirit of false and spurious generosity to abstain
<col>462</col>
from attacking you? Surely the idea is one which cannot be entertained by responsible men.<lb/>
Then I come to the question, If invasion is conceivable and possible in one of these various forms, have we the Army with which to meet it? We have the Regular Army, and not one word shall fall from my lips in disparagement of that branch of the service. I believe at the present moment it touches a higher point of efficiency that at any time during the last twenty years. You have the Special Reserve, about which not a single person in the course of this debate has been found to speak in any language except that of polite contempt. In the third place, you have the Territorial Army. Now, my Lords, I must congratulate the Secretary of State for War upon the manner in which, by efforts on his own part which are beyond praise, he has induced people to accept and applaud that organisation. It is true that most of the noble Lords who have spoken of it qualified their language, and described it as a framework, a skeleton, or a scaffolding, and that, of course, a little modified the eulogy. At the same time the Secretary of State has received a testament from many of your Lordships which must be very gratifying to him.<lb/>
But yesterday the crescendo of enthusiasm reached its climax in the speech of the Under-Secretary for War. A speech more loyal to a chief was never delivered. The noble Lord said that the Territorial Army had struck its roots deep into the heart of the nation; that it was a perfect organisation, which admitted of no modification whatever. As I listened to the ample rhetoric of the Under-Secretary I could not help recalling the well-known passage of Don Quixote, in which that gallant knight asked&#x2014;
<quote>"Dost thou not hear the neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of the drums?"</quote>
to which his faithful squire responded&#x2014;
<quote>"I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep."</quote>
It would be far from my wish to institute so invidious a comparison; but when we hear this stream of undiluted panegyric poured upon the Territorial Army it is necessary to remind the House that of its 270,000 heroes as many as 100,000 are
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0235"/>
<col>463</col>
under twenty years of age, and to ask whether a single independent military critic in this House or in the country will say that that Force, whatever its merits, is adequate in physique, in training, and in numbers for the objects which it may be called upon to perform, or will deny that it is hopelessly unreliable for purposes of serious war. It may be the very finest raw material in the world, but nobody could dream for a moment of calling it a finished product.<lb/>
Then we come to the point which is really the gist of this debate. It is all very well to deride or depreciate the Territorial Army, but the question may fairly be put whether this Bill is likely to provide you with a better, force for the purpose for which it is required. I have been very much astonished that almost all the speakers have thrown very great doubt upon this. There has been a much greater inclination to disparage the Army proposed by the noble and gallant Earl, Lord Roberts, than there has been to analyse or expound the merits of the Territorial Army. But let us look at the point. Surely there can be but one opinion about it. Under your Territorial Army scheme, as I understand, your recruits are supposed to have fifteen days, but as a matter of fact most of them only have seven days training. That is not a training in any serious or practical sense, but is merely recruit drill. It is accompanied by no shooting. It is a sort of holiday performance in uniform. Under this Bill your recruits will have four months in camp under competent officers, receiving rifle instruction throughout that time, and benefiting by practical training. The four months in the first year are to be followed by fifteen days in each of the three succeeding years; so that you will get a total of 165 clays in the period of four years devoted to the business-like training of the soldier. It is quite true that at the end you will not get a finished soldier, but you will get a half or a two-thirds finished soldier&#x2014;at any rate, you will get a very different sort of product from the Territorial Army man who has merely had his seven days training and is supposed to defend his country against the trained soldiers of Germany upon the strength of that contemptible preparation.<lb/>
May I be allowed here to notice the two somewhat curious pictures that have been
<col>464</col>
drawn in the course of this debate of the life that the recruits are expected to lead under this scheme? The Duke of Northumberland drew a really pathetic picture, with a touch of parental anxiety in it, of the youth of this country being drawn at an impressionable age away from their homes, huddled in barracks and canteens&#x2014;why barracks and canteens I have no idea, seeing that the training is to take place in camp&#x2014;losing the virtues that they have imbibed from their fathers and acquiring all sorts of faults and vices in their place. That may be a true picture of the life of a conscript in France or Germany, but it has nothing whatever to do with the life of the recruit under the Bill of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl the Leader of the House gave an extraordinary description of what is to take place in these camps. We learn that the working classes will not like to go into them because the fusion of classes is not popular. I drew the conclusion that what he was going to point out was that the working classes would not like to associate with people like ourselves. Not a bit of it. The working classes would not like this admirable scheme because they would have "to associate with the riff-raff." That is surely a strange doctrine to emanate from that Bench. Then the noble Marquess (Lord Lansdowne) spoke of the 150,000 first-year recruits as though they would be agricultural labourers and artisans, and he spoke of the danger to industry that would ensue if they were taken away in the summer months. Well, the 150,000 men will not all be agricultural labourers, or all artizans, or all riff-raff, or all democrats, but they will be a mixture of all the elements of society. I should hope that the upper and educated classes will be largely represented in the training camps. I can imagine nothing better for all classes than the discipline of the camp, nothing more democratic than that all these persons, the aristocrats, the middle class, the lower class, and even the "riff-raff" should be drawn together to take their training side by side, nothing more patriotic than that this national duty should be undertaken by all instead of being devolved upon the shoulders of a small minority more self-sacrificing or less indolent than their neighbours.<lb/>
The next point is this. We have been told
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0236"/>
<col>465</col>
that this force would be no more ready to take the field than the present Territorial Army. Now we know that the Territorial Army will have to wait for six months before it can take the field at all. It is hoped that its numbers will reach 313,000, but so many will be occupied upon garrison duty and other necessary avocations that it has been calculated that not more than 40,000 or 50,000 would be available to enter the field against the invader. On the other hand, compare with this the scheme of the noble and gallant Earl. Of course the number produced by his scheme would depend largely on the time it had been in operation. The total would increase year by year, but in any case you must get an enormous advantage as regards numbers. The majority of them, or, at any rate, a large number of them, would be drawn from a good class of people. They would be a highly educated and respectable class of men, and above all, they would have had a real and serious military training. Of course it is quite true to say that man for man they would not be fit to set against the professional soldiers of a European army. But what they lacked in individual quality, they would make up in numbers, and, in any case, they would be sooner ready for their work than the soldiers of the Territorial Army could possibly be. Above all this force would set free the Expeditionary Army for service outside the country and the Navy for its operations in any other part of the world.<lb/>
There are only two other arguments which have been used of a general character to which, with your Lordships' permission, I will allude. They have been endorsed by the highest authorities. The first is that if this money is spent on the Home Defence Army the effect must be to reduce the amount available for the Regular Army. But the expenditure on the Army is not a fixed sum, so that if something is added at one end it must be taken off at the other; and there is nothing therefore to prevent the Government from increasing the expenditure upon any one branch of the forces if it finds it necessary to do so. Any Government that attempted to stint or jeopardise the Regular Army with a view to buttressing up the Home Defence Army would speedily be taken to account by the constituencies. For my own part I believe the people of the country would be the last to use any such argument. I think they expect both the Home and the foreign Army
<col>466</col>
to be kept up to a proper state of efficiency; and all the arguments used in this debate about the intolerable burden of &#x00A3;4,000,000 or &#x00A3;8,000,000 a year for a particular branch of the service are arguments which, I believe, would not appeal at all to the constituencies at large. What the people want is to be certain that the country and their homes are safe, and they will not quarrel about four or eight millions, but will be ready to give much more provided they can be assured of security.<lb/>
The second argument is one to which I should not have been disposed to attach very great weight if it had not been used, and seriously used, by the noble Marquess. It is the argument that compulsory service would injure recruiting for the Regular Army. Is that the case? The argument has more than once been employed, but is it anything more than a speculation? Is it possible to pronounce upon the matter so definitely as some noble Lords have been disposed to do? Surely all military experience is to the contrary. When you had the old Militia is it not well-known that men were always being drawn away from the Militia to the Regular Army, and it was one of the complaints made by Militia officers that they could not keep their men because of the rival attractions of the superior branch of the service; and why a man should be driven away from a military career because he has been put through four months compulsory training I cannot for the life of me understand. It would seem to be much more likely that his preliminary experience would arouse the dormant martial instincts that lie hidden in him, and that you would find your Home Defence Army acting as the best recruiting sergeant in the world for your Regular Army.<lb/>
The hour is getting on and I must bring my remarks to a close. The only concluding argument to which I would draw attention is one upon which great stress has been laid, particularly from the Front Opposition Bench, and that is the argument that the introduction of a Bill like this is the business of a responsible Government. It is true that a Bill introducing compulsory military service can only be introduced and passed on the initiative and authority of the Government of the day, and, further, that no Government is likely to take this action unless it is con-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0237"/>
<col>467</col>
vinced that it has the sanction of the country behind it. That we all accept. We introduce this Bill not in the least because we expect it at this moment to be carried into law, not even because we expect it to pass its Second Reading in this House. We know that the attitude of the noble Marquess has rendered that impossible. The present Bill has been introduced as the recognised way of bringing our proposals before the public. So long as we were content with resolutions people said, "You indulge in generalities; let us have concrete proposals." Now that we put them in the form of a Bill everybody says "How very inconvenient! Do you really mean that you are going to ask the House of Lords to pass this Bill, and if they do so are you going to have a conflict with the other House?" We contemplate nothing of the sort. We have introduced our Bill because we think it is the best way of submitting to the public a more detailed scheme than anything we have before put forward. Some day, perhaps, a responsible Government will be willing to take up a measure of this sort. In the meantime it is for irresponsible persons to push it forward. A good deal of spade work will, I daresay, be required on our part, but you may be perfectly certain of one thing, that as soon as the country gives any general indication of a willingness to take up this matter, a responsible Government will be found to take it up also.<lb/>
My Lords, we are not dissatisfied with the reception which has been accorded to</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00804">our Bill in this debate. It is true that many useful and valuable criticisms have been passed upon details of the measure. By those criticisms we shall, I hope, profit in the same degree as I trust the country will benefit by a more clear understanding of the principles which we advocate. For my own part, I believe that whatever be the fate of this immediate Bill, or of its successors, there is no shadow of a doubt that this country will ultimately be driven to the acceptance of some form of compulsory military service. It will be driven to it, if it does not accept it of its own free will&#x2014;and you may be right in thinking that it will be reluctant&#x2014;by the sheer force of necessity, and the necessity will arise because you cannot permanently stand the strain and cost of the effort to keep up your naval supremacy. You cannot expect to do so, viewing the competition you have to face, the resources and the spirit of the countries with whom you have to compete. Your naval supremacy is already wavering. In years to come you will find it has slipped away altogether from your grasp, and when it has gone, then you must have an Army for home defence, and after you have realised that you must have such an Army you will have no alternative but to resort to compulsion.</p>

<title>DIVORCE IN COUNTY COURTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00827"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to ask your Lordships' indulgence while I move a Resolution in these terms&#x2014;
<quote>"That it is expedient that jurisdiction to a limited extent in divorce and matrimonial cases should be conferred upon County Courts, in order that the poorer classes may have their cases of that nature heard and determined in such Courts."</quote>
The County Courts Bill which was introduced by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack last week, for reasons which he explained at the time, did not contain any reference to the subject which forms the basis of this Motion. The Committee appointed to inquire into certain matters of County Court procedure, and over which I presided, had various matters to consider, and, amongst others, the particular matter upon which I am now about to address your Lordships. The other matters with which they dealt have been discussed for a lengthy period, but the particular matter which I propose to place before your Lordships has not had similar consideration.<lb/>
The Report of the Committee deals very fully with the subject, and I propose to refer to one or two points in it when I have placed your Lordships in possession of the facts upon which I base this Motion. The Committee were unanimous, with one exception. This is a subject of very great importance, and I feel the gravity of it and the responsibility of endeavouring to put what I think about it and the facts before your Lordships. I do not think I should have attempted to do so unless I had a long experience of the subject, and unless I had felt myself impelled by years of watching this class of case to come to a conclusion about it which I feel it to be my duty to lay before your Lordships. I wish to make it plain, at the outset, that this Motion does not propose to deal with any alteration in the law. I do not propose to enter into what might be a very controversial subject as to the merits or demerits, the advantages or disadvantages of a particular system of divorce law. My Motion is confined to a matter of procedure, and its object is to bring the reform effected by the Statute of 1857 within the reach of those who at present cannot afford the cost of proceedings in the High Court.<lb/>
The grounds upon which I have thought it desirable to bring forward this Motion are two&#x2014;first, that poor people may be able to assert the rights which they see other
<col>474</col>
people asserting and which they cannot afford to assert themselves; and, second, because the conviction has been forced upon me, by a long experience of this unfortunate class of work, that the present state of affairs is adverse to the best interests of public morality. I do not wish to refer at any length to the state of things before 1857. Everyone is more or less familiar with the history of the causes which led to the passing of that Act. The law before 1857 did not allow of any divorce a <i>vinculo</i>, but only a <i>mens&#x00E2; et thoro</i>, which is in the form of what is termed a judicial separation. For 150 years before that Divorce Acts were passed in Parliament. I have taken the figures as far as I am able to do so at this distance of time, and I find that from 200 to 250 Divorce Acts passed through both Houses in the 150 years that elapsed before the 1857 Act came into force. These were mostly cases in which the petitioners were husbands, but there were some cases in which wives were the petitioners. It is clear that a regular course of procedure was adopted. The Standing Orders of the House pointed out how the procedure had to be carried out, how the proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Courts had to be laid on the Table, how the verdict against a co-respondent had to be produced. The cases went through the Courts if the evidence permitted it, and the Bills went through both Houses and became Acts of Parliament; and thus by an elaborate machinery marriages were dissolved.<lb/>
In moving the Second Reading of the 1857 Bill, Lord Cranworth referred to the procedure, and said that relief was beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest classes. That Bill became law, and has stood, with slight amendments and improvements in procedure, for the last fifty years. It established a central Court in London, and gave certain powers to send cases down to Assizes, but those powers were practically useless. It also contained provisions for the purpose of enabling petitions to be presented to the Judges of Assize in order to obtain decrees of judicial separation and decrees of restitution of conjugal rights. But that was not found practicable in working, and the following year those powers were repealed, and the whole work of this country was left to be dealt with by the central Court in London so far as it related
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0241"/>
<col>475</col>
to matrimonial cases. The Act took away the jurisdiction which existed in the various Consistory Courts.<lb/>
When the Act of 1857 was before Parliament there was a discussion with regard to the proposal for giving the County Courts jurisdiction in these cases. It was felt that the Bill would not reach the poorer classes, but objection was taken to trusting the County Courts as they then stood, and in the end only the central Court was established, because it was not considered that County Courts could be safely trusted with the exercise of this delicate jurisdiction. But now the position has very much changed. The County Courts have had enormous increases to their jurisdiction in all classes of work. In the County Courts Bill at present before your Lordships' House there is a proposal that the County Courts should have unlimited jurisdiction in Common Law cases, subject only to the right of defendants to have their cases removed into the High Court if they so desired. The want of confidence displayed in 1857 has really, I think, come to an end, and there is now such confidence in these Courts that a demand has been set up throughout the country that County Courts should have jurisdiction&#x2014;I am not thinking for the moment of the exact jurisdiction&#x2014;so that poor people could bring their cases before them.<lb/>
The Act of 1857 put the power of bringing matrimonial cases within the reach of persons who had adequate means to come to the High Court, but it did not put that power within the reach of the vast masses of the community. In 1878 an Act was passed which gave magistrates in petty sessions the power, which had not been entrusted to the County Courts in 1857, to make a judicial separation order where a wife had been assaulted in an aggravated form by her husband and had summoned him before the police court. The order which was thus permitted to be made was an order permanently separating the two parties to the case. In 1866 another Act was passed to meet cases in which men had deserted their wives, giving the magistrates power to order the payment to the wife of a weekly sum for her maintenance. But it gave no power to order permanent separation. That was not wanted in cases of desertion. What was wanted was the money. Lastly, in 1895, there came the
<col>476</col>
Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women's) Act, which amalgamated both those Acts, and gave the magistrates power to make a permanent order of separation on five different grounds. Magistrates were empowered to order a permanent separation where there had been cruelty. They had power to order a permanent separation where there has been desertion or neglect to maintain a wife. They had power to order persons to be permanently separated in cases where there had been cruelty and protection was wanted, and also in cases, where protection was not wanted but mere payment was really required&#x2014;that is to say, in cases of desertion, and in cases where a husband had refused to maintain his wife. No powers were given in favour of the husband against the wife. They only dealt with cases put forward by the wife. But they were to be dealt with in petty sessions, although these powers had been refused to the County Courts and although these orders have a life-long effect on the people concerned.<lb/>
In 1896 the subject of giving a local jurisdiction was before the Council of Judges, with a view to reporting to the Lord Chancellor on the question of a demand by Lancashire for local sittings of various kinds; and at that time I considered this subject in order that a report should be made upon it. I wish to read to your Lordships the view I took then, and to state why I have since felt under an obligation to change the view I then expressed. In one paragraph this appears&#x2014;
<quote>"It has hitherto been considered desirable that all divorce cases should be tried before one tribunal sitting permanently in London, and there appear to be very serious considerations weighing against any proposal to extend the trial of these cases to different parts of the country, considerations which seem to preponderate over the advantages to some individuals of lessening expenses to be incurred by them in these cases. Under the existing law of divorce, the Court has to exercise its functions, not merely in the interests of the parties before it, but of society at large, and it is important that the Judges who administer this branch of the law should be thoroughly familiar with it, able to take counsel together when necessary, should preserve uniformity in the exercise of the large discretionary powers conferred on the Court, should be assisted in guarding against collusion by a staff of officials whose experience is of the greatest service to the Court, and should be aided by a Bar familiar with the mode of conducting this peculiar class of work. I think it is highly undesirable to allow these cases to be tried at Assizes."</quote>
I have to withdraw from what I then said,

and the reason for that action I will put before your Lordships. At that time I had not had anything like the experience which I have since been able to gain. I had not&#x2014;no one had then&#x2014;been able to appreciate the effect of the operation of the Act of 1895, which had only been in force a few months. The effect of that Statute and the investigations I have made over a number of years has led me to change the view I expressed in 1896, but only so far as it relates to the poorer classes. I do not change that view in the least with regard to people who can afford to come to the central Court.<lb/>
I find that poverty prevents large numbers of people&#x2014;what those numbers may be it is quite impossible to say&#x2014;from having access to the Court in London. A second point is what I believe to be the very disastrous results produced by the Act of 1895 in some respects. As to the poverty of the people, the Committee over which I presided dealt with that question in the following paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"There is a close analogy between the state of things which still exists and that which existed before 1858. For there is still practically one law for those who can afford to bring a suit in the Divorce Court and another for those who cannot, and the latter embraces a very large portion of the population who cannot afford even the moderate expense of a suit in the present Court. The cost of bringing or defending a suit in London and having the hearing there, renders it quite impossible for many of the poorer classes to get the relief which those better off obtain. The great proportion of the cases are undefended, but proof of the facts before the Judge is necessary; and even in these cases, poor people very frequently cannot find the money to commence and proceed with these suits and bring their witnesses from a distance to London, nor can they find the time or leave their employments for sufficient time, either to file their petitions in London, which practically they have to do themselves unless they have a solicitor, whom many of them are too poor to employ, or to attend a hearing in London. This is especially the case with parties who are at any substantial distance from London. Letters on this subject have been constantly received by the late President of the Court from poor people urging reform in this matter, and protesting against the injustice to them of the present system. On the one side, people often cannot find the means to bring their suits at all, or only after saving up for years to do so. Many instances of this latter class come to the notice of the Court. On the other hand, many persons cannot find the money or time to come up to London to defend themselves. And, further, as the husband usually has to find the means to enable the wife to defend herself or sue him, many cases are stayed because of his inability to do so, a state of things which may last for months or years, or never be overcome, and this even applies to cases where there is really no defence. Without doubt there is a practical
<col>478</col>
denial of justice in this matter to numbers of people, and these are people who belong to ranks in life in which the relief to be obtained under the Divorce Acts is probably more necessary than in ranks above them."</quote>
I can myself vouch for the points made in that paragraph. I have made it my practice for a number of years to inquire of the poorer people who came before me, and whose cases were obviously brought at a very much later period than the dates of the offences, how it was that they were able to bring the suit at all; and I have never experienced a more unpleasant feeling than when these people have told me how they have had to borrow or save the money. People have been before me who have been saving the money for twenty years to get a divorce in a case to which there was no defence at all. I have made inquiries from one of the most experienced Registrars, and he reports to me that the amount of the petitioners' costs in ordinary undefended cases may be taken to vary from &#x00A3;40 to &#x00A3;60. The whole of the costs practically fall upon the husband, who must provide them before he can start at all. And further, he usually has to find the money to enable his wife to conduct her suit. If it were suggested that people might proceed <i>in form&#x00E2; pauperis</i> it might be pointed out that then only the Court fees, from &#x00A3;6 to &#x00A3;8 are saved, so that there is still a great expense.<lb/>
In addition to the question of costs there is this difficulty, that people in this class of life cannot easily find time to come to London, even if they had the money to do it. They are in small occupations, in factories, and in all sorts of small occupations, and to ask masters and mistresses to let them go away presents very serious difficulty especially if they have to be some little time in London. There was one case before me of a woman who, after many years, had saved &#x00A3;20 to enable her to bring a suit. I asked her, "How did that enable you to bring your case on?" The reply was, "The solicitor is helping me and doing it for nothing." In many cases solicitors have behaved most handsomely in this matter. In addition to those broad facts, I received letter after letter when President of the Divorce Court from people complaining bitterly of their inability to bring their cases into Court. My recollection of the substance of one of those letters, which was most pathetic, and only a sample of many I received, was as follows&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0243"/>
<col>479</col>
<quote>"I am a poor workingman earning only 18<i>s</i>. a week. My wife has chosen to go away with another man, and is actually living with him only a short distance from me. I could prove it in a minute, but I cannot go to London to prove my case there, and I am absolutely debarred from the divorce which I am entitled to."</quote>
It is not pleasant for a Judge to receive letters of that kind and to feel that he can do nothing. Again, what are the consequences if a man like that is left without any remedy? I am informed that cases have been met with frequently where people have committed bigamy because they were left without remedy; they have felt justified in marrying again and taking their chance of what would happen.<lb/>
There is another side to this question. Letters have been received from women who have been left by their husbands, with little or nothing&#x2014;in the case of people of the working class&#x2014;to enable the woman to sue. The husband disappears, and goes to America, or Canada, or Australia. She has no remedy at all, for her means will not enable her to trace him. This is one of the points I would like to emphasise as showing the change in the present condition of things as compared with 150 years ago, when people could not move away, but were subject to the influences of their surroundings. Those conditions have disappeared. Now the first thing that happens in these troubles is that the man or the woman, but chiefly the man, is off to America. They can get across for a few pounds. They often make a new home and take up a new wife or husband, as the case may be, and the one who is left behind never hears anything more of them again. Practically speaking, the working classes have almost an insuperable difficulty in bringing their cases properly before the Court. And there is another aspect. I have frequently had letters from persons who cannot afford the money to defend. I have mentioned the case of a man or woman who, by borrowing from friends, has succeeded in getting the money together to launch a suit; but the other side may not have money to come to London, though they could attend in a local Court. This shows what a difficulty there is, if a local jurisdiction to some extent is not given, to meet this grievance, and the object of my Resolution is to meet that grievance.<lb/>
I may say that my successor in office has also been struck with these features of this unfortunate class of business. Is it not this class of person who want relief
<col>480</col>
more than those in the upper circles, who have many amenities, not possessed by the poorer classes, to enable them to bear their difficulties? The causes which lead to divorce are found more among the lower than among the upper classes. The chief is the miserable cause of drink. I believe that if the effects of drink could be abolished altogether the Divorce Court might almost close its doors. There is also the pressure of the struggle for existence upon the lower classes. The bulk of divorces take place after a considerable number of years of marriage, and that is because the pinch of existence is felt more at that time with the result that sometimes weariness, exhaustion, and so forth drive people into dissipation and produce disastrous consequences. The County Courts really exist for these people. The objection may be raised that this proposal would flood all the local County Courts with cases that are not desirable. The proposition in the Report does not go to that extent. It is that the Courts should be at places selected by the Lord Chancellor as suitable. Let us take the great cities of Lancashire and elsewhere, such as Birmingham and Leeds. Why should those people be obliged to come to London? If, as is said, the jurisdiction and work of County Court Judges might be so much extended that the number of Judges would have to be increased, justice should still be done, even if it cost the country something more.<lb/>
I pass from that part of the subject to what I call the serious effects of the Act of 1895. I think that the serious effects produced by that Act could have been little anticipated in 1895. That Act gave the power to order permanent separation for causes which I am satisfied are in many cases trivial. I venture to say with conviction that the effect of those orders is extremely bad. I have known cases in which summonses for desertion have been taken out at the end of a week or month, and permanent orders for separation made between persons who are fairly young, and, who in the natural order of things, have many years of their lives before them. What is the immediate consequence of that? For a time the man will pay. Then he will cease to pay, will cross the sea, and will next be heard of in America. When you get a situation like that how can you possibly do what in former times you might perhaps have done&#x2014;that is, bring people together and induce them to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0244"/>
<col>481</col>
make the best of things? It cannot be clone, because in cases like I have mentioned the man becomes a citizen of another country, and his wife gets no money. That, I think, is frequently the consequence of these orders&#x2014;a consequence which is often most disastrous to the morality of both the parents, and to their children.<lb/>
I think, my Lords, the consequences to a woman living like that may be readily understood. She has nobody to keep her and she cannot marry. The consequences to the man are very much the same, but very often he goes to America or to some other country and sets up a new home altogether. I venture to say that very many of these cases would on investigation be found to be cases in which a divorce would be capable of being obtained if that course were open to the parties suing for a separation order. Let me tell you, if I may, the number of these separation orders granted per annum. The annual average between 1903 and 1907&#x2014;I have not the statistics for 1908 yet&#x2014;is 6,959. I venture to say that if you take this as going on year after year, with an annual average of about 7,000, it must be evident that an enormous number of orders have been made under which people are living apart at the present time.<lb/>
It may be true that in certain cases people return to each other, and, by living together again, put an end to these orders, but I am satisfied that in a vast number of cases they do not do so, because many cases heard before me, in which a suit for divorce has been instituted when means have, after a time, become available for the purpose, have begun with a separation order. It is also probable that if only the means were forthcoming many of these 7,000 cases would be cases in which divorce would be granted if the Court could exercise divorce jurisdiction. I draw this conclusion because I have seen the necessary proof given when sufficient money has been saved to bring an action for divorce after a considerable interval, and also because in the High Court there were 623 divorce cases in which decrees absolute were made in 1907, while there were only twenty-three decrees of judicial separation. That is to say, there are a very small number of decrees of judicial separation in the High Court and a very large proportion of decrees absolute. I think, therefore, the inference may reasonably be
<col>482</col>
drawn that of the large number of separation orders which I have mentioned many would be found to be cases in which, if there were jurisdiction, the matter might be put an end to by a proper decree.<lb/>
For this purpose, my Lords, there should be a proper Court. Magistrates in petty sessions can hardly be considered an adequate or satisfactory tribunal for disposing of cases which require very careful consideration, and which have life-long effect on the people who are affected by the orders made and far-reaching consequences to their children. The means by which we ventured in the Committee's Report to suggest that this evil should be dealt with is by giving jurisdiction to a limited extent to such County Courts as may be approved for the purpose, very much as the Bankruptcy and Admiralty Courts are selected and approved to deal with cases. The limit of jurisdiction is somewhat difficult to fix, but after reflection the Committee came to the conclusion that it might be exercised in cases where the joint income of the parties was less than &#x00A3;150. That would bring relief within the reach of persons to whom the payment of costs amounting to &#x00A3;40 or &#x00A3;50 would be an impossibility.<lb/>
Persons who wished to bring cases would, of course, have to satisfy the learned Judge in the first instance that their incomes were below this amount, and if they did that the jurisdiction of the Court could be exercised. If the learned Judge thought there was any suspicion about the case he might be allowed the power to order it at once to be sifted in London. It is suggested in the Report that in all cases the papers should be examined in London before the case came on. At the present moment no case comes before the Judge of the Division which deals with work without an official of Somerset House going through the papers and certifying that they are in order. Some control by the High Court could easily be exercised. It may be said that this would occupy much of the time of County Court Judges, but I have endeavoured to suggest an answer to that; and I would ask your Lordships to bear in mind the further point that most of these cases would probably be wholly undefended. Let me tell your Lordships how the matter stands in the High Court. In 1907, 631 cases were tried or disposed of in the High Court in
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0245"/>
<col>483</col>
London and of that number 502 were undefended. The latter cases took I suppose on an average some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour each to dispose of. Only 129 of the cases were defended and I think it would probably be found, if the statistics could be examined more closely, that the bulk of even those so-called defended cases were not defended when they came into Court. It is probable that the bulk of cases that might be brought in the local tribunal would be undefended and would be capable of being dealt with very briefly.<lb/>
One other objection has been suggested as militating against these proposals&#x2014;namely, that if the proposals were adopted every local town would have its newspapers full of reports of these unpleasant cases. I do not think that would amount in the end to an adequate objection, because I should go so far as to suggest that the publication of such reports should be entirely prohibited. I should myself have been very glad to see that prohibition extended to the High Court of Justice. I do not mean to suggest the closing of the Court so that those interested in a case should not be able to attend and see that justice is properly administered. But I can see no advantage to be gained by publishing details of these cases, and that is an opinion I have expressed more than once. Of course, the decrees might be published, as is the case in France, where no detailed reports are allowed to appear in the Press of divorce trials.<lb/>
I feel so strongly on this point that I took action in the matter some time ago. I found that the illustrated papers were in the habit of sketching everybody who came into Court and publishing those sketches. My powers enabled me to stop that in the Court, and I was then asked by various persons interested whether they might sketch from memory and so forth, and also sketch outside. Of course I had no power to stop that, but I appealed to the most important of the illustrated papers and asked them to consider whether they thought it was to the advantage of the British public that they should be furnished with these sketches, and have special attention called to these cases. What was the answer? The illustrated papers practically said that they had not considered the matter from that point of view before, but now that they saw it in that light they would
<col>484</col>
give orders to stop the publication of all sketches of the kind. I could not tell your Lordships how grateful I felt that the appeal which I had made to those papers was met in that courteous and responsive way. The result is that to a very large extent, if not entirely, those illustrations have ceased to appear, not as the outcome of any order, but by the voluntary action of the Press when the matter was brought to their attention. Is not that a step in the direction of prohibiting the publication of the details of divorce cases altogether? If that step were fully taken I believe that no harm could arise from the fact that divorce cases were tried in country places as well as in London.<lb/>
I am aware, my Lords, that the proposals I have ventured to put forward in the shape of this Motion will not meet with approval in all quarters, and more particularly in the case of those who on principle are opposed entirely to the complete dissolution of marriage by decrees of divorce. But I would suggest for the consideration of those who take that view that the question now raised is not whether there should be a law of divorce or not. That question, I venture to say, was thrashed out and disposed of fifty years ago. The question we have now to consider is whether a large portion of the community should be left to feel that the remedies given by law are out of their reach while they are within the reach of persons with more means than they have.<lb/>
My motion is based, first, upon the ground that poor people should have adequate opportunities of asserting their rights, which they cannot be said at present to possess. For all practical purposes they are in the same position as they would have been in if the Act of 1857 had contained a clause saying that no divorce should be granted to people with an income of less than, say, &#x00A3;150 a year. Just imagine what would be said if any attempt had been made to introduce such a clause; and yet that is practically the position to-day. Secondly, my motion is based on the ground&#x2014;and I think this is almost the most important ground&#x2014;that unless these people can get the remedies, unless those remedies are brought within their reach, immorality is certain to result. It is to the best interests of public morality that in cases where a right to divorce is given by law, and the necessity for it exists, the injured party should be able to obtain
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0246"/>
<col>485</col>
divorce and not merely an order for Judicial separation.<lb/>
I am glad to think that the fate of this Motion will not depend on any words I use. It must depend on whether the fact I have brought to your notice commend it to your Lordships' favourable consideration or not. It may be that these matters with which I have become familiar are not so familiar to your Lordships, and that you require further inquiry. It may also be that the points I have raised touch upon larger matters which require consideration, and if, at the end of this discussion it is thought that there should be further inquiry, either by a Committee, or, as I would prefer, by a Royal Commission, into the whole subject of the law of divorce and its administration, then the matter might be dealt with in that way without pressing this Resolution to a decision. But in the meantime, with the object of bringing this matter before your Lordships&#x2014;a matter which is of very grave and great importance, and one which I felt it was my duty to ventilate in this House&#x2014;I beg to move the Resolution standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00828">Moved to resolve, That in the opinion of this House, it is expedient that jurisdiction to a limited extent in divorce and matrimonial cases should be conferred upon County Courts in order that the poorer classes may have their cases of that nature heard and determined in such Courts. &#x2014;(<i>Lord Gorell</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00829"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure I am expressing the feeling of every member of your Lordships' House in thanking the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down for the lucidity, moderation, and force with which he has brought before the consideration of the House and the country a matter of supreme and vital importance. We cannot fail to be impressed with the weight legitimately belonging to his prolonged experience, although that experience is&#x2014;I shall return to the point in a moment&#x2014;of one particular sort and has been gained from one particular point of view, and requires, perhaps, the qualification which is to be found in the aspect the question may present when it is looked at from a different standpoint and by those whose experience of the subject is, I will not say equally great, but is derived
<col>486</col>
from another mode of intimacy with the problem.<lb/>
Every one in the House must have been interested in the historical summary and the contemporary picture of facts which the noble and learned Lord has given us. I am certain, too, that every one in the House shares the sympathy which the noble and learned Lord expressed for particular cases which have come to his notice of sorrow, difficulty, and, it may be, of extreme hardship. And yet, with all that, I venture to believe that we should be acting with supreme unwisdom were we to pass the Resolution which he has moved to-night. Quite apart from the great question of principle which is indirectly raised by any discussion of this subject, we should not, I believe, as I shall try in a few minutes to show, gain by the proposal which the noble and learned Lord has made the end which he has so clearly and definitely in view. It is, of course, simply impossible to exaggerate the importance of such questions as these in their direct and indirect bearing upon the home life of great sections of the people of this country.<lb/>
There is a real clangor when a man Who is a past master of some particular branch of knowledge, technical, difficult, perhaps even unpleasant, gives to the House or to the country his views upon it with all the weight that experience entitles those views to, that people may, so to speak, be frightened away and not venture to challenge either his premises or his conclusions. I am going to be rash enough to challenge both the premises on which he has based a good part of his argument, and the conclusion he draws from them; and I am quite sure, alike from the noble Lord's judicial eminence and from what he said at the conclusion of his speech, that he will be the first to wish that we should see to it that, before we come to any conclusion upon this matter, our knowledge of it should be as accurate, as extensive, and as varied in the sources from which it comes as can possibly be contrived.<lb/>
May I clear out of the way two Matters of debate? I was relieved to hear the emphasis laid by the noble and learned Lord upon the fact that he was not to-night dealing with, or asking the House to deal with, the great fundamental questions which concern the existence of divorce laws
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0247"/>
<col>487</col>
or their operation in the country as a whole. The general question of the rightness or wrongness of those laws is one upon which very different opinions exist in the country and in this House. We probably should not agree about the details; possibly we should not agree even about the large and fundamental principles. That matter, however, is not, as Lord Gorell has reminded us, before us to-night. The noble and learned Lord is not asking us to deal with, change, or affect in any way the great principles which are at stake. He has spoken, if I understood him rightly, on the working hypothesis, let us call it, that the country is perfectly clear about its divorce laws. He does not ask us to alter the conditions which are at present a necessary preliminary to the granting of a divorce. He is speaking simply of the administrative process by which, once those conditions are satisfied, divorce can be brought within the reach of a larger number of people than is the case at the present day. I must guard myself by saying that, if the larger question were raised, I should be perfectly ready to deal with it, and that, if we believe harm to be the outcome, on the whole, of divorce laws, we shall watch necessarily with anxiety and even with alarm any administrative extension of their application.<lb/>
One other point. I have, of course, no sort of desire to plead for, or wish to see maintained, a distinction in this or in any other matter between the rights and privileges of the richer and poorer classes. If a thing be right in itself, useful to men, and conducive to the best happiness, then I should entirely agree that it ought, as quickly and as widely as possible, to be made accessible to everybody. But I will try to meet the noble and learned Lord's arguments on his own grounds and on the basis of what he has himself put before us in the extracts which he has read from the clear and elaborate Report for which he is responsible and in the speech to which we have just listened. I need not guard myself again against being supposed to abandon any larger principle that may be raised here.<lb/>
The main part of the argument of the noble and learned Lord was based upon the result which he thinks has followed from the laws which allow, or multiply, the granting of separation orders. This argument, unless I misunderstood him, is in general outline this&#x2014;that per-
<col>488</col>
manent separation orders have become very common under the Act of 1895, and I think also under the subsequent Act of 1902, which allowed drunkenness to be brought in in a special way; that there are nearly 7,000 of such orders given annually in this country; that the operation of these leads to immorality, and that, of necessity, homes must be made unhappy to a far greater degree than would occur if divorce were given instead of separation. The noble and learned Lord and others who have taken up the cause which he has argued to-night say that there are great numbers of illegitimate children&#x2014;shall we say needlessly illegitimate children?&#x2014;brought into the world, under the circumstances he has described, as the outcome of these separation orders,&#x2014;children who need not have that slur upon them if their parents had been able to obtain divorce. Therefore, he says, multiply the facilities for divorce among the poorer classes of the population and some of these evils, at all events, will be alleviated or removed. I should like to meet that first of all by reference to statistics, although I do not want to lay special emphasis on that, and then by reference to the experience of those who are in daily touch with this question, alike in the administration of the law and in tile homes of the people. I must apologise for the roughness and perhaps the paucity of the details or statistics which I can produce on the subject, but, as the House knows, the time available for obtaining them since the noble and learned Lord gave notice of his Motion has not been very long, and at this season of the year all of us are not men of absolute leisure.<lb/>
The argument with regard to separation orders is that from 1895, when they were multiplied, it has been clear that immorality must be increased by the existence of those facilities to a degree that would not have happened if the parties had all been divorced. From that premise we should expect to find two or three things follow. The first is that after 1895 we ought to be able to trace in the statistical returns which give the number of illegitimate births an increase of immorality; next, that there ought to be a larger percentage of illegitimate births found in the places where separation orders were most frequent, and then, I presume, that there ought to be comparatively few applications for separation orders in London and the metropolitan area, where, as the noble and learned Lord has pointed out, the Divorce
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0248"/>
<col>489</col>
Court is accessible. In his Report he specially says that he does not make his proposals apply to London for that reason.<lb/>
Now, as a matter of fact what do we find? In the last thirty years there has been a perfectly steady diminution in the number of illegitimate births, and that diminution has not been in the least affected or retarded by the passing of the particular Acts of 1895 and 1902. There has been no check to the decrease. In his Return the Registrar-General takes 1,000 unmarried women or separated or widowed women&#x2014;women who cannot legitimately have children&#x2014;and he shows the proportion of illegitimate births to the proportion of such women. In 1880 the proportion was 14&#x00B7;1, in 1894 the proportion was 9&#x00B7;9, and in the last Return available, it was 7&#x00B7;8. That reduction has been going on quite steadily. If you take the table in another form it shows that, whereas in 1880 there were 48&#x00B7;3 illegitimates out of every 1,000 babies born, in 1907 there were only 39&#x00B7;4 per 1,000.<lb/>
In the next place, the conclusion from the noble and learned Lord's premise is that illegitimacy should be greatest where separation orders are most frequent, but the very contrary is the case. The largest number of separation orders in proportion to the population are given in Lancashire, the metropolitan area of London, and in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In none of these is the illegitimate rate high. In London it is 6&#x00B7;4 per 1,000. Turning to regions where separation orders are very few, we find that in Anglesey illegitimacy is 12&#x00B7;9 per 1,000 of unmarried women, in Merioneth 12&#x00B7;7, and in Norfolk 12&#x00B7;8, double the proportion which is found in some of the places where separation orders are most frequent.<lb/>
The statistics, I quite admit, cannot with any confidence be relied upon as in themselves proving the matter one way or the other. Many incidental causes may affect them, but if we accept the argument of the noble and learned Lord we ought to find in the statistics what we markedly do not find, that is, evidence in the direction of the consequences he would apprehend. So far from the statistics corresponding with the result which his argument would lead us to expect, they show abundantly that we ought to be very cautious before we accept the noble Lord's conclusions as
<col>490</col>
definitely proved, and they seem to me to show abundantly the need there is for inquiry before any action is taken in the direction he desires.<lb/>
But far more important, far more worthy of weight, is the experience of those who have had to deal practically with this matter. The time allowed has been short, but I have done what I could. I have been in touch in the last few days by means of letters or interviews with some of the police court magistrates who have given the largest number of those separation orders, and, what is in some ways as important, with the chief clerks of the police courts who are in daily touch with the problem. One of these officers has been most kind and considerate. I did not give him the shadow of a hint as to my expectation of what the facts would turn out to be, but he took untold pains; he told me he had seen the warrant officers, the police court missionaries, the relieving officers and other people habitually about the courts who would be in closest touch with the kind of people concerned. Besides that, I have been in communication with some of the clergy who have special knowledge of the poor of our great cities, going in and out among them, helping them with counsel or warning, and whose experience is most likely to be helpful in a matter of this kind.<lb/>
Now, what is the outcome of these inquiries? It is not doubtful. For example, I have had a long conversation with one magistrate of vast experience in two different parts of the poorest districts of London, and he is absolutely clear&#x2014;first, that in very few cases indeed in which applications for separation orders have come before him is adultery even alleged, or so far as can be learned does it exist. He thought ten per cent. at the outside; the chief clerk said that it would not be so many. By far the majority were cases of respectable, hardworking women who were being bullied, ill-treated, and neglected by cruel and drunken husbands.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord said with perfect frankness that he had no detailed information on that subject and what he has urged has been based largely on what he would naturally expect to be the result, and on particular letters which have in individual cases come under his notice
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0249"/>
<col>491</col>
in dealing with Divorce Court cases. I am describing now the experience of those who have to deal practically every day with this question, and the first information they give me is to the effect that, as far as they are able to judge, these are not cases which would be capable of being regarded as justifying divorce had they come before the Divorce Court.<lb/>
What is extremely important evidence is the satisfactory working of the present law whereby separation orders involve the payment by the man of an allowance to the wife. Maintenance orders, amounting to, perhaps, as much as 7s. a week, are very satisfactorily collected even during long terms of years while the man is living away from the woman. A few bolt, but the number of such cases is surprisingly few. If the woman is immoral, if, that is to say, the result which Lord Gorell thinks will follow from a separation order does in fact ensue, she ceases to be qualified to obtain her aliment order, which she forfeits if she can be shown to be tripping.<lb/>
But, my Lords, perhaps the most important of all the evidence which accumulates from different quarters is the very large proportion of cases in which separation orders have been in operation for a little while and then the parties make it up and come together again. Many such cases were brought before my notice this morning. I have statistics from one Court where 150 separation orders have been granted in the last twelve months, and in fully one-half of these the couple are living together again as man and wife, while of these only four have so broken down as to impel them to ask for a new separation order. That seems to be a kind of evidence which it is difficult to get over, and requires us to be very careful before we proceed to the course here recommended, for if divorces had been granted these reconciliations would never have taken place.<lb/>
I turn from the magistrates and magistrates' clerks to the clergy. Some of your Lordships may, perhaps, think that is evidence to which less importance should be attached, but in the short time available I have, without the least attempt to pick particular men, except as to their qualifications and experience, communicated with clergy in London, Portsmouth, Birmingham, and elsewhere in order to find out what is
<col>492</col>
their view after a large and varied experience of the poorest class of the population with whom they are in constant touch, both in pastoral ministration and through relief committees, charity organisation work, and various other agencies of a similar kind. Their answer is practically unanimous that separation does not usually imply unfaithfulness, that the return to one another is quite common, and that maintenance orders on the whole are well paid. In some cases the applications are granted much too easily, but the evidence is most striking that where the magistrates tell the applicant, "Don't take your order to-day; wait a fortnight and see if you cannot make it up again," in many cases they never hear any more of the matter. I venture to say that the contentions in this Report require to be very carefully examined before we can accept them as proved.<lb/>
A very few words on the larger aspect of the question. The noble and learned Lord has told us to-night that one main cause of the mischief is drink. He said that if the curse of drink were abolished the Divorce Court might close its doors. I am not disposed to differ from him on that point, and the utterance is one of extreme importance which will not speedily be forgotten. But how would the proposals in this Report meet that difficulty? He does not propose that divorce should be obtainable on grounds of drunkenness&#x2014;a proposition on which I should have a good deal to say. I do not quite understand, therefore, how the argument bears on the difficulties which the noble Lord desires to see removed. It has been said by many that the sheer pressure of existence, hard times and the cost of bringing up children, leads to divorce, but this is not borne out by statistics. The returns from America correspond to our own in showing how large is the number of divorcees who have no children. According to the table for 1906 nearly forty per cent. of the divorcees in England and Wales had no children, twenty-three per cent. had only one, and only two per cent. had large families. With all respect to the experience of those who use the argument I have referred to, I hold that children are a deterrent to divorce and not a cause.<lb/>
Anyhow, how would this proposal of County Court divorce meet those difficulties I What I believe would happen,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0250"/>
<col>493</col>
if we were to give the wholesale facilities for divorce which are suggested by the Report, is that we would lower the gravity of the popular ideal of the marriage bond. You would encourage pressure to make divorce obtainable for other causes than those for which it may be obtained at present. That I believe to be the main danger that underlies the whole proposal. The noble and learned Lord disclaims that, but that such must be the tendency I think we cannot doubt. Look at what it has been across the Atlantic, where the facilities for divorce have been so increased that now decrees are granted annually in the United States to the number of 72,000. Whereas the increase of population in the last ten years has been twenty per cent., the increase of divorces has been sixty-six per cent. All the best public opinion in America is outspoken on the gravity of the evil, and all attribute it to the wide range of causes for which divorce is granted. That is the risk we incur if we were to go forward in the direction recommended. In America the evil has reached such a point that I notice in a recent newspaper triumphant reference made to a Judge in San Francisco who a few weeks ago heard and decided seven cases of divorce in twenty-eight minutes, and granted the decree in every case.<lb/>
I do not touch upon the question of publicity through reports in the Press. I am in complete sympathy with Lord Gorell as to the mischievous and ever polluting character of those reports; yet we dare not forget that publicity has its gains as well as its disadvantages; there is a wide difference of opinion on the subject. Neither will I touch on the question whether the County Court is the right authority to choose. That is really a question for lawyers and Judges rather than for me; but I say strongly that I know well the contrast of the feelings entertained among the poorer classes towards the County Court and the feelings they entertain towards Courts whose jurisdiction is of a different character. To go before a magistrate is a serious thing but to go before a County Court is almost a humorous thing, and it is not supposed to imply discredit to any one. The point to bear in mind is the mischief that would come about if we placed this grave marriage question within the category of mere petty disputes which come before the County Court.<lb/>
<col>494</col>
But the really important question is this &#x2014;Is any change in this direction needed, and will it help towards maintaining public morality? I am prepared to deal with the question to the best of my power when it is deliberately brought up for consideration and decision, but all the conclusions of my own investigations are to the effect that though separation orders are undoubtedly necessary in a great many cases, they are often granted too easily and too lightly, and that the present system calls for full inquiry and careful attention if we desire to legislate and move in this matter. As for divorce itself, if we believe that on the whole there is no real boon conferred or gain obtained for the community at large, no real healthy security created for the morality of home life among the classes who take advantage of the facilities, we must of necessity look with profound anxiety on any proposal in favour of extending, almost lavishly, these facilities to other classes than those who take advantage of them now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00830"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the noble and learned Lord, Lord Gorell, one question in regard to a matter which I do not clearly understand in the proposals he has made to the House. I probably misunderstood him, and if I have done so he will correct me. In a speech which Lord Gorell made on April 27, 1909, his Lordship was understood to express his desire not merely to increase the facilities for decrees for dissolution of marriage by extending the power of granting such decrees of divorce to County Courts, but also to increase the number of causes for which they could be granted. Was that the case?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00831"><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: I do not recollect any speech of the kind in which I gave public utterance to that view. The only statement I might have made bearing upon that is to be found in the report of the case "Dodd against Dodd," in which I suggested matters worthy of consideration. I do not recollect any speech of the kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00832"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: I am extremely glad to hear that that is the case, and after the statement of Lord Gorell there is nothing more to be said on that point. But however much the noble and learned Lord may wish to confine his proposals to the mere extension of facilities for divorce which are permitted by the existing
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0251"/>
<col>495</col>
law, that is not the way the subject is looked upon by many others. One result of the proposals which Lord Gorell has put before the public has been the attention called to the subject in the Press, and the advocacy of an increased number of causes for which divorce might be granted. There has also been established a Divorce Law Reform Union which very much applauds Lord Gorell's proposals, and it recommends nine additional causes for which divorce ought to be granted. There is, first, wilful desertion, and in his speech the noble and learned Lord alluded over and over again to desertion, persons leaving the country, and the facilities for travelling which enabled them to disappear, and if there was any inference to be drawn from those allusions it was that in cases merely of desertion and nothing more divorce ought to be granted.<lb/>
But it is not merely wilful desertion which this Divorce Law Reform Union are advocating as an additional cause for divorce. They are advocating divorce in cases of insanity, habitual drunkenness, unconquerable aversion, cruelty, incurable disease and penal servitude, and, in a pamphlet written by a Mr. Haynes and published and circulated by the Union, incompatibility of temper is given as a reason why a divorce decree should be granted. I am satisfied that anyone who is the least conversant with the literature which is springing up on this subject will see that the noble and learned Lord's proposals are welcomed as a step in a much wider direction than anything his Lordship himself has contemplated. Therefore these proposals do open a very wide door, and the matter is much too serious to be taken up lightly. It requires to be gone into to the very bottom before we accept legislation which will be looked upon as only a step to something wider, and which will be absolutely deplorable for the morals of the country. The police magistrates in London, since the noble and learned Lord's proposals have been made known, have been advocating that they should have jurisdiction to grant divorces, and also on the grounds which I have mentioned.<lb/>
I should like to bring to your notice what is the experience of persons most conversant with this subject. Take the late President of the Divorce Court, Lord St. Helier. He has left it on record that in regard to divorce we have to consider
<col>496</col>
that the Court has to exercise its functions, not in the interests of the parties before it, but of society at large; and I think it most undesirable that divorce cases should come before the sort of tribunal here advocated. Anyone who is familiar with the proceedings of the Divorce Court is aware that that Court is a perfect sink of collusion and perjury. The intervention of the King's Proctor does, to some extent, reduce the admitted evils of that Court, but if jurisdiction in regard to divorce is going to be extended, even to the limited extent that the noble and learned Lord proposes, over the country, how will it be possible for the King's Proctor to intervene in the hundreds of cases in which he ought to intervene? I cannot imagine anything more destructive of the morality of the country than this extension of the number of Courts which will have jurisdiction in cases of divorce.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord himself is conscious of the evil that would be done by the publication of the proceedings in these cases throughout the country. No one can look with greater disgust than I do upon the reports that we see from time to time in the papers in regard to these proceedings. They are deplorable in themselves and they are deplorable reading; but yet I have come to the conclusion, most unwillingly, that, bad as it is that these reports should be published and read, there is, as the most reverend Primate hinted, a great deal to be said on the other side. There are many persons who would not shrink from divorce in itself, but who do shrink from the publication of their evil deeds before the world; and it would be a very serious thing to get rid of that deterrent.<lb/>
I wish to add a word to what fell from the most reverend Primate in regard to the state of things in America. If you will consult the official statements made about divorces in America you will find that the average duration of marriages terminating by divorce in America is ten years, and that from 1887 to 1907 no fewer than 945,623 divorces took place in that country. That is, one out of every twelve marriages in America is dissolved! President Roosevelt, only a short time back, speaking of American law in regard to this matter, said the divorce law in America was "an appalling curse." There are more divorces in the United States of America than in any
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0252"/>
<col>497</col>
other country in the world, and in an official report, published after extensive investigation, it is stated that divorces are multiplying three times as fast as the population.<lb/>
I do not, as a rule, give credence to stories, but this is a fact which I could prove, and I could give the names if necessary. It occurred in what is thought to be the best society in America, and this is the conversation which was overheard not long ago. One little girl said to another, "You know, we have got a new papa, and I hear that you have got our old one." My Lords, these are horrors. But when one thinks of the wretchedness and the misery that are the result of these proceedings, one does look with the greatest apprehension on any legislation which may have the effect of increasing divorces, and, as a direct result, lowering the view of marriage, the sanctity of the home, and the security of family life. The noble and learned Lord made one statement that certainly seemed to me very extraordinary &#x2014;namely, that if there was no drink, the Divorce Court might close its doors. From the little knowledge I have of the poorer classes, I should certainly not assent to that statement; and I think that if your Lordships, without looking down to the poorer classes, would turn to what we see going on in our own society, you would certainly be the last to say that drink is the cause of the troubles we see about us.<lb/>
I should like to earnestly endorse what fell from the noble and learned Lord at the close of his speech. Our marriage law is in a state of complete confusion. We have one law in Scotland, another law in England, another in Ireland, and another in the Colonies, and you have the whole question of domicile, which is a most difficult one. Persons in England unable to get a divorce by our law, go to America, get domiciled and obtain a divorce and come back here. Then questions arise as to whether those persons are legally divorced in this country. You have the law of divorce on one side, and the conscientious convictions of all kinds of people on the other; and I do suggest to the noble and learned Lord and to the Lord Chancellor whether, not merely in regard to these matters but in regard to the whole marriage law, the time has not come when there should be a Royal Commission to look into the whole subject and to try and bring some order out of the
<col>498</col>
present chaos. If His Majesty's Government would appoint a Royal Commission to look into the whole question, I should hope that the outcome would be some simplification of our marriage laws, and that we might see some end to our present confusion, and might hope to have peace in the future in regard to all these difficult problems. But we shall never have that until something on the lines suggested is done on the responsibility of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00833"><sup>*</sup><member>The LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I sympathise with a great deal that has been said as to the danger and uncertainty which arises from the present mode of procedure with reference to divorce, but this is not the question which has been raised by the noble and learned Lord. The most reverend Primate has given very forcible reasons and evidence, were we discussing this afternoon the question of the desirability or non-desirability of separation orders. That, however, is not the question brought before the House by the Motion. The most reverend Primate said, very truly, that this was not the time or place to go into the great question of principle involved in any discussion of the divorce law. I agree. The question of whether it is right or wrong to have a divorce law, or a system which allows of divorce, is not raised by this Motion.<lb/>
The present divorce law is the law of the land, and every one of the King's subjects is entitled to have access to the advantages or disadvantages conferred by that law. The noble and learned Lord has laid before us that which has been a matter of notoriety for many years, that practically the law of divorce as at present administered is a law entirely for the benefit of the wealthy classes. The poor man or woman is deprived of its benefit. The defect in the system which has grown up, and which, in my judgment, is getting worse and worse, is that the expense, the delay and the difficulty of getting cases heard in the Divorce Court are at present insurmountable to the poor, and under the present administration the largest class of the community are deprived from getting the advantages of the law. Where adultery has been committed&#x2014;and it is a curse to any circle or family where it is committed&#x2014;we know that the poorer classes are shut out from having the relief which the law of the land provides. The
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0253"/>
<col>499</col>
only question before the House is one of administrative process, and not of a principle. I ask you to dismiss from the question whether divorce be right or wrong. The divorce law exists, but you shut out one class, the class which has not the money to obtain divorce. Can any noble Lord maintain that it is a right principle in this country? Why should one class of His Majesty's subjects be deprived of this remedy? Why should they be shut out from a remedy by the cost? From what I have heard, the costs are not a matter of two figures only; they generally run into three, and sometimes, in a disputed case, into four figures. It is impossible for a poor man or woman to have any remedy under the present state of affairs. The noble and learned Lord is not asking the House to commit itself to an extension of, or to give reasons for, divorce, but to consider whether the present mode of administration of the law can be improved.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Viscount opposite as to the evils of the American system. It is a public scandal, and any approach to introducing it here we should all oppose. If a man earning eighteen shillings a week has an unfaithful wife who is a curse to his home, let him have the relief which a wealthy man can get without any difficulty. That is the evil the noble and learned Lord has asked us to deal with. I should have thought it was one of the very first principles of justice. For the recovery of civil debts we give the poor a simple Court, and we give them a system which, by prudence, will enable them to get justice readily and cheaply. Why not apply this to this greater curse and evil? I ask your Lordships to put on one side the general question of the divorce law. We might sit here almost for a week arguing that question, and no one would be convinced. Now that we have rescued ourselves from the state of things which existed before 1857 and which the noble and learned Lord described, we ought to do something on the lines of this Motion.<lb/>
I would recall the well-known observations of Mr. Justice Maule in 1845. A poor man was brought before him charged with bigamy, which he had committed under circumstances described in similar cases by the noble and learned Lord. Mr. Justice Maule told the man the procedure he ought to have taken. He ought
<col>500</col>
to have brought a civil action for damages; then he should have gone to the Ecclesiastical Court and obtained a divorce a <i>mens&#x00E2; et thoro</i>; and finally, having spent a large sum of money in taking these preliminary steps, he should have gone to Parliament for a private Act to have the divorce made full and complete. The expense might amount to five or six hundred, or, perhaps, a thousand pounds. The prisoner said he was a poor man, but he must understand that the law was the same for the poor as for the rich. That was the state of things which existed then, and now we find that the remedy which the Legislature gave is incomplete. I do not say I should agree with all that the noble and learned Lord proposes. He only asks us at the moment to approve of an inquiry being held. I understand that the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, would not object to that. Whether or not it should take the form of a Royal Commission, I will not say, but I think the time has arrived when the matter should be looked into. This is a crying evil in the administration of justice in this country, and it is the duty of both Houses of Parliament to find a remedy if they can, and one which will work satisfactorily.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00834"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount opposite has misunderstood the Resolution moved. I should be very glad of an inquiry, but the matters spoken of by the noble Viscount show, I think, that he has omitted to read the Resolution. Apart from a great many other circumstances to which I shall have to refer, nothing could be more inexpedient than passing without inquiry a Motion like the one before the House. The old story of the difference between rich and poor is applicable to every kind of litigation. And when the noble Lord tells us that the divorce law is the law of the land, I would point out that that law, when it was passed, was said to be guarded by the peculiarity of the Court to which it was confided, and a great many of the difficulties which might arise in the ordinary course would not apply. With reference to the noble and learned Lord's experience, he was a party, I understand, to the statement which he has read, I think, with great candour. But I wish to point out that when he says he has since changed his mind, he has done so in a great measure by reference to what he considers to be the effect of the orders under the Act of 1895. I hope I do not misunderstand him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00836"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, but will he allow me to call his attention to what the statement was? This is the statement of which the noble and learned Lord approved and which was adopted by the Committee of the Council of Judges&#x2014;
<quote>"It has hitherto been considered desirable that all divorce cases should be tried before one tribunal sitting permanently in London, and there appear to be very serious considerations weighing against any proposal to extend the trial of these cases to different parts of the country, considerations which seem to preponderate over the advantage to some individuals of lessening expenses to be incurred by them in these cases. Under the existing law of divorce, the Court has to exercise its functions, not merely in the interest of the parties before it, but of society at large, and it is important that the Judges who administer this branch of the law should be thoroughly familiar with it, able to take counsel together when necessary, should preserve uniformity in the exercise of the large discretionary powers conferred on the Court, should be assisted in guarding against collusion by a staff of officials whose experience is of the greatest service to the Court, and should be aided by a Bar familiar with the mode of conducting this peculiar class of work. I think it is highly undesirable to allow these cases to be tried at the Assizes."</quote>
Now I have read that very deliberately again in order to ask the noble and learned Lord as to which of the very important allegations suggested in that statement he desires, as the result of experience, to alter or qualify. His experience of the facts which came before him appears to me to throw no light upon that. Are any of those advantages which are peculiar in the Central Court to be found in the County Court? There is the question of having a Bar familiar with the practice of the Court and a large staff belonging to the Court peculiarly acquainted with the necessities of inquiry into collusion and so on. Is it suggested that a large staff of that character is to be supplied to every County Court to which you are to give jurisdiction? Not one of those propositions seems to me to be met by the experiences the noble and learned Lord has had. I am unable to follow the reasoning which suggests that his experience has led him to change his mind.<lb/>
One of the reasons why I should refuse to vote for a Resolution such as this is that you do not know to what extent you are expected to go. If I had a concrete Bill before me, I could understand what was
<col>502</col>
intended; but this Resolution says that you are to alter a law in this most important respect, and that one of the securities in giving the original jurisdiction is to be taken away. You are not to have a central Court, you are not to have a familiar Bar, you are not to have a whole staff of persons engaged in administering this particular form of justice. The difficulty I have in dealing with the question is that until I have a Bill before me I do not quite know where we are. Does the noble and learned Lord suggest that a County Court may grant a divorce where a person has disappeared&#x2014;that there is to be no question of misconduct in itself? That would be a very serious alteration of the law, and I do not quite understand from the noble and learned Lord what he means in that respect. As to the picture he has painted of the poor woman deserted by her husband, the County Court would have no jurisdiction unless there had been a matrimonial offence, and the picture that he paints of the deserted wife remains. Does he suggest that, without giving notice to a man who has disappeared, the wife should be able to sue him for divorce in a County Court and obtain a decree? I do not think he would suggest that. A great deal of what my noble and learned friend has told us on the subject, although very pathetic no doubt, is quite outside the question. I do not wish to discuss the More general question when the matter before us is a Resolution which, under any circumstances, I think your Lordships should not adopt.<lb/>
When it is suggested that divorce should be extended, we have a right to look at what has been the effect of that divorce which has been permitted since fifty years ago. Will anybody say that it has not seriously injured the purity of family life? And when we are asked to extend it, and to make it a more familiar and common thing, I cannot forbear saying what I believe to be solemnly true, that it has inflicted most serious injury upon the purity of family life in this country. That may be a subject for inquiry, but certainly to frame a Resolution without inquiry in the first instance seems to be a very serious and rash undertaking. The remedy, such as it is, of proceedings <i>in form&#x00E2; pauperis</i> exists there as well as elsewhere. With reference to the very old story of Mr. Justice Maule and the observations with which we have been regaled to-night, we have heard the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0255"/>
<col>503</col>
story a great many times before. Mr. Gladstone once said it was true that an application was made <i>in form&#x00E2; pauperis</i> where a divorce was procured by an Act of Parliament. But what is intended here is that you should go out of your way to alter the present law, give the power of divorce without restrictions, and make it so cheap and so common that it may be one of the ordinary incidents of human life. With reference to one question raised by the noble and learned Lord, I may say that my experience has not been very favourable to the attempt to suppress the publication of proceedings in the Divorce Court. I brought in a Bill on the subject in this House, and, I have no doubt wisely, the House refused to read it a second time. The view was, and I have no doubt that was in the minds of the most reverend Primate and the noble Viscount, that the publication of proceedings in the Divorce Court is to some extent a deterrent.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord was good enough to tell us some of the places where he proposed that these Courts should be established, but he has not told us in what way you are going to distinguish the litigants. I can well understand, with such a procedure as he speaks of, that persons who desired to escape the publicity of the Courts in London would have recourse to the County Courts in a convenient place, without much scruple about claiming the privileges of poverty. That is one of the modes in which I think this would be a mischievous proposal. To my mind the great objection to this House committing itself to such a proposition as this is that the facts upon which it is proposed to base such a change in the law should be framed as to procedure simply on the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, based upon certain experiences he has had. As to his accuracy, as far as he himself is concerned I have no doubt, and I hope he will not think I am doubting him; but in reality they are based on conjectures of a much wider character than he is capable of giving personal knowledge of, and I think those matters ought to be tested before such a change as this is brought about. I hope your Lordships will not assent to the Resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00837"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell has had his first experience of the difficulties which always
<col>504</col>
arise when anyone attempts anything in the direction of reform, but I hope he will not be discouraged by the reception which in some quarters his proposal has met with. The proposal, I venture to think, has been completely misunderstood. It is not a question as to whether any good has resulted from the Separation Act. No doubt some good has resulted. It is not a question whether any alteration ought to be made in the law either of marriage or of divorce. I should be very careful, I hope, at any time not to suggest an alteration in the law of marriage or divorce without inquiry and full consideration, and should then proceed step by step, taking only one step at a time, knowing the difficulties before me.<lb/>
Nor is this a question as to whether divorce is a good thing. Ever since we emerged from the Middle Ages, divorce has been accepted in principle hundreds of times by both Houses of Parliament. There have been private Acts passed up to 1858, by the score, at all events, and I believe by the hundred. That was done by Parliament, but whether done by Act of Parliament or by a Court of law is immaterial so far as the general acceptance of the principle is concerned. At the present time we constantly have cases of Divorce Acts being proposed from Ireland. There have been some this year, and ever since I have been on the. Woolsack we have had some private Acts for divorce from Ireland. Nobody ever says a word against them, not because any one who knows the subject desires to see divorce or fails to see a great deal of evil in it, but because by consent of Parliament it has been held that the evil is more than counterbalanced by the advantages. I do not want to go back upon that subject.<lb/>
An Act was passed under which if a man has &#x00A3;100 he can get a divorce, if he has &#x00A3;50 perhaps he can get a divorce, but if he has less than that he has to submit to the injury and ruin which you allow other people to resent and remove. I cannot understand on what principle of policy or fair play you can defend that. I grant that we must have regard to the principle that in our tribunals there is a third party constantly present&#x2014;namely, the public interest; but I cannot see how we can justify saying that if a man has &#x00A3;100 he shall have his remedy, but if he has not &#x00A3;100 or &#x00A3;50 he shall not. The fact is that the poorer the people are the harder are the consequences of matrimonial mis-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0256"/>
<col>505</col>
conduct. When a man has children and no one to look after them, and is obliged to bring up those children in destitution, in a miserable hovel, he suffers more than a man in affluent circumstances, who has the misfortune to encounter sorrow of that kind.<lb/>
I heartily agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell in every word that he has said. I think he is right in his proposal, and for my part I shall always support that view. As to the County Court as the tribunal to which it is proposed to give a limited jurisdiction, it is true, as Lord Halsbury has said, that we do not define the limit in the Resolution. It is always the criticism on a general Resolution. If you bring in a Bill many will say, "I would vote for the principle, but I cannot approve the details." It is proposed that a limited jurisdiction should be given to selected County Court Judges. My noble friend said that the Lord Chancellor for the time being should have power to appoint places in which this jurisdiction should be exercised. There is such power in cases of bankruptcy and other cases; and I undertake to say, deep as is the respect which I have for the Judges of the High Court, that you will find County Court Judges who are quite as capable of conducting these cases and watching the public interest as are the Judges of the High Court. What we want is a straightforward, able, experienced man who will be able to do justice. Justice is not at all difficult to do when once you know the facts.<lb/>
I want to express my concurrence with my noble and learned friend in another matter, which, perhaps, is not particularly relevant to this debate. He said that there ought to be an end to the publication of proceedings in the Divorce Court. I thoroughly and heartily agree with him, and I was a member of a deputation which waited upon the noble Earl when he was Lord Chancellor to urge upon him such a reform. Publish the names of the parties if you like, and publish the decrees, and let the disgrace be the punishment of the guilty party, and let everybody know whether people have been divorced. But it seems to me very strange that anybody should think that there should be any compensation for the mass of dirty stuff which you see constantly published in some newspapers which are a disgrace to journalism. In my opinion people are not nearly free enough in their criticism of the
<col>506</col>
Press. The Press is uncommonly free and I hope will always remain free to criticise your Lordships' House. They are welcome to criticise me as much as they like; but I intend to take the liberty of criticising the Press, and I say it is a disgrace to journalism that some of these things should be published in the newspapers as they are. It does nothing but harm, especially to young people.<lb/>
My noble friend in bringing forward this Motion indicated&#x2014;and I think he was quite right&#x2014;that if inquiry into this subject were desired he would not resist it. That is the view of the noble and learned Earl and of Lord Halifax. I do not think we ought to resist any suggestion for inquiry. Nobody would desire to thrust legislation touching this grave matter upon either House of Parliament. I shall certainly bring all that has been said before my colleagues, and I believe and hope that they will take a favourable view of the suggestion as to an inquiry. The terms of the reference would not be very easy to draw; probably there must be some limit. But if that would meet the views of your Lordships, perhaps my noble and learned friend may not think it necessary to divide the House upon this Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00838"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the concluding words of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack have afforded me great relief. The noble and learned Lord began his observations by saying that he feared the position was being misunderstood by the House. The matter is so full of difficulty that I was fully prepared to find that on many points I might be uninformed; but what I do think I understand clearly is that the noble and learned Lord on the Cross Benches by his Motion asks me to commit myself to the view that jurisdiction to a limited extent in divorce and matrimonial cases should be conferred upon County Courts. I am very glad that I am not to be invited this evening to pronounce a hurried opinion on such a point. When the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack the other evening introduced a Bill dealing with County Courts&#x2014;a Bill, I think, founded to some extent upon the Report of Lord Gorell's Committee&#x2014;he omitted from that Bill proposals dealing with this very question, no doubt because he felt that it was not altogether expedient to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0257"/>
<col>507</col>
load his Bill with so difficult and embarrassing a question.<lb/>
I am not going to recapitulate the arguments, but the main arguments upon which the noble and learned Lord rests his case do appeal very forcibly to me. He tells us, in effect, that the law in this country with regard to divorce is in such a condition that the relief which is easily, or comparatively easily, accessible to the wealthier classes is practically denied to those whose means do not permit them to seek such relief. I think it is stated in the Report of his Committee that, even in undefended cases, the trouble and time necessary were such that poor people were debarred from seeking the relief which they required. It is, however, impossible to listen to the debate without feeling that, strong as that argument undoubtedly is, there are other arguments to be considered. What kind of tribunal are you going to set up if you are going to give these unrestricted facilities for divorce? What would be the effect of our action, not only upon the parties concerned, but upon society as a whole? These are matters which require to be considered, and surely if we are to weigh these different considerations the only way of doing it is to adopt the suggestion of My noble friend, Viscount Halifax, and to appoint a Committee or Commission to deal with the matter. I understood the noble and learned Lord himself to be agreeable to that course, and the noble Viscount opposite, Lord Wolverhampton, I think addressed the House under the impression that that was what we were being asked to do, which is not quite the case. The noble and learned Lord ended his speech by saying that justice is not difficult to do when you know the facts. My Lords, let us have an inquiry and endeavour to ascertain the facts.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MERCANTILE MARINE&#x2014;EYE-SIGHT TESTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00841"><member>LORD MUSICERRY</member> rose to move for a Return showing the colour-vision tests adopted by France, Germany, and the United States for their merchant services. The noble Lord said: My Lords, when I last brought the subject of tests for colour-vision before your Lordships I was informed that I had made no case for an inquiry into the reliability of these tests. Since then I have been informed that the Holmgren wool test, which is the test adopted by the Board of Trade, has been discarded by nearly all other nations as absolutely unreliable. This test was recommended by the Committee appointed by the Royal Society as far back as 1891, and in all probability at the time it was the best that could be thought of, but experience has shown that it is not satisfactory.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00842">The noble Lord who opposed me on the last occasion said he knew that in my opinion the Board of Trade never could do anything right. I must demur to that statement. I know they can, and occasionally the Board of Trade do what is right, and I would always be the first to give them credit when they introduce any practical and useful reform. But I would ask your Lordships, Do you think that referring the very technical question of colour-vision tests to the late Advisory Committee, a body composed of shipowners, underwriters and others, none of whom could have been regarded as experts in this matter of colour-vision, can be considered a wise or practical move on the part of the Board of Trade? I submit that not only did I on the last occasion make a good case for the inquiry into this matter for which I asked, but the noble Lord's own speech showed the necessity for such an inquiry; and to prove my contention I will refer to a paragraph in the Report of the Committee on Colour-Vision to which both he and I alluded, and on which Report the Board of Trade have been acting during all these years. On page 19 of the Report of this Committee are the following words&#x2014;
<quote>"Cases have been brought before the Committee's notice where a candidate who has failed at first has passed at a subsequent examination. If the test for colour-blindness was fair to a candidate and perfectly efficient, such a re-examination would be unnecessary and passing upon re-examination would be impossible."</quote>
I claim that I showed your Lordships on
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0258"/>
<col>509</col>
the 30th of last month, and that the noble Lord in his speech also showed your Lordships, that, according to these words in the Report of the Colour-Vision Committee, the present tests are neither fair to the candidate nor perfectly efficient, for the noble Lord himself told you that twenty-seven candidates were passed on re-examination.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00843">In the course of his reply the noble Lord representing the Board of Trade alluded to Sir William Abney as being recognised as the greatest living authority on this matter of colour-vision tests. Dr. EdridgeGreen, who, I believe, has devoted all his life to the study and investigation of colour-vision, states that he brought three colour-blind persons to Sir William Abney, who tested them with the official wool test and declared that their sight was all right. Now if in the hands of one who is such a great authority on this subject the official test could be so unreliable, what is likely to happen when the same tests are being used by the Board of Trade examiners, who certainly can in no way claim to be experts in the matter of colour-vision? Is it not possible that many candidates are rejected whose colour-vision is perfect, and, on the other hand, some candidates may be passed by them whose colour-vision is defective? Therefore if the Board of Trade are so solicitous on this matter for the safe navigation of our merchant ships, would it not be well if we were to ascertain what the other nations have done in this respect so as to try and find some really reliable test?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00844">I should like to offer one suggestion, and I am sure the noble Lord opposite will consider it a most fair and reasonable one, and I hope he will put it before the President. It is that the Board of Trade should issue a notice calling the attention of parents who are thinking of sending their sons to sea to the advisability of having their eyesight, both for form and colour-vision, carefully tested first, so as to avoid the possibility of these young men, after having served for four or five years, finding that owing to defective colour-vision they can no longer pursue their profession or hope to attain certificated rank, and therefore that the best years of their life have been wasted and that they must seek out some other profession to earn their livelihood. I am sure the noble Lord will regard this suggestion as only fair and just.</p>

With regard to what the noble Lord has said as to the twenty-seven candidates who passed on re-examination, I would like to point out that those were twenty-seven candidates out of 24,000 candidates examined during the four years, and that, I think, is rather a testimonial to the care with which those tests were carried out than otherwise. The noble Lord calls attention to the Holmgren wool test. There, again, the Board. of Trade are of opinion that those tests have proved satisfactory during the many years in which they have been in use&#x2014;since 1894; and during those years an average of 6,000 persons have been examined every year.

<title>MILK AND DAIRIES (SCOTLAND)<lb/> BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00851" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00852">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00853"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will probably not desire that I should make any lengthy observations on the Second Reading of this Bill, more especially as it is pre-eminently a Committee Bill rather than a Bill in which any matter of far-reaching principle is raised. It is, in the first place, a consolidating Bill, and, in the second place, it carries the existing legislation in some respects a stage further.<lb/>
The existing law in Scotland, as your Lordships are probably aware, is to be found in Sections 60 and 61 of the Public Health Act, 1897, in Sections 83 and following of the Burgh Police Act, 1903, in the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1885, and subsequent amending Orders, made under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, in the Cattlesheds in Burghs Act, 1866, and in various provisions in local Acts obtained by the larger burghs. The last two heads are not touched by the present Bill, but the other enactments are consolidated by the Bill and some of their provisions carried further. The sections of the Burgh Police Act deal chiefly with the supply of milk from cows suffering from tuberculosis, and give burghs certain powers as against rural areas of supply. The sections in the Public Health Act deal generally with cases of infectious disease traced to a milk supply. These provisions are generally re-enacted, and some new provisions are added to ensure the healthy condition of dairy <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> and others engaged in handling milk. It may be mentioned that amid the restrictions on milk supply there is no provision in the Bill for the slaughter of diseased animals; that is dealt with by the recently-issued Order of the Board of Agriculture, which, as your Lordships know, applies to Scotland as well as to England.<lb/>
Another part of the Bill re-enacts, with amendments, the provisions of the Dairies Order of 1885. The main changes made are as follow. For the registration of dairymen is substituted the licensing of the premises used by them. It is now made mandatory, and not optional, for local authorities&#x2014;that is to say, district committees&#x2014;to make
<col>512</col>
by-laws for various purposes connected with the conditions under which dairies and milk shops are kept. The central public health authority&#x2014;the Local Government Board&#x2014;is empowered to make general regulations regarding the treatment and transit of milk intended for public consumption. For the occasional inspection of dairies upon complaint arising is substituted a regular inspection, and the appointment of a veterinary inspector is made possible by all local authorities and obligatory if the Local Government Board require it.<lb/>
The only other part of the Bill now requiring to be referred to consists of several clauses inserted to make the enforcement of the law regarding milk supplies more effective. Thus, the Local Government Board has conferred upon it for this purpose the power which it has under the Public Health Act of going to the High Court to get a compulsitor placed upon a local authority neglecting its duty with regard to milk supplies; and, similarly, the local authority of an area importing milk may appeal to the Board to put this machinery in motion against the local authority of an area from which it imports milk, if the latter is neglecting its duty under the Act. Perhaps I should also mention that by-laws regarding the structure, lighting, ventilation, &amp;c., of dairies are not to be applicable to dairies where the dairymen themselves sell milk in small quantities only, to persons in their employment, or to neighbours.<lb/>
Those are the principal points in this Bill, and I feel sure your Lordships will be in entire sympathy with its object, which is to protect the milk supply principally of the great urban communities. In so doing the Bill seeks to avoid imposing on the rural areas from which the milk comes any conditions which are likely to be too onerous for those rural districts. I trust your Lordships will be good enough to give the Bill a Second Reading. I am aware, from representations I have already received, both orally and written, that there are many points of interest, many points which require elucidation, and many points possibly which require further examination by those responsible for the Bill; and I can assure your Lordships that I shall be very happy, on behalf of the Government, to give the fullest consideration to any points which may arise.</membercontribution></p>

<col>513</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00854">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Pentland</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00855"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of offering any opposition to the Motion for the Second Reading, and with regard to the Bill as a whole I do not think that I have any grave objections to offer to its provisions so far as they relate to the matter of milk. As the noble Lord has said, this Bill is, perhaps, more a Bill for Committee. There are a good many points which will have to be raised in Committee, and probably that will be the more convenient opportunity for dilating on several of the matters in the Bill at greater length. But there are one or two points which seem to me not very clear, and on which I should like some information.<lb/>
In the first place, I think that some explanation ought to be given of the word "dairy," because as the definition stands now it is at least doubtful to what dairies it is intended to apply&#x2014;whether the Bill is limited solely to dairies from which milk is sold, or whether it includes private dairies. And in the same way with regard to the word "dairyman." The definition of "dairyman" as it stands includes a cowkeeper. I do not know whether that is intended to include every person who keeps cows; if so, it is very evident that the quantity of inspection under the Act will be almost without limit.<lb/>
Taking the points which were dealt with by the noble Lord, I see that there is a proposal that the Local Government Board should make general Orders. When we come to Committee I will suggest that those Orders ought to be laid on the Table of both Houses; but, in passing, I may say that one reason why I personally think this Bill worthy of approval is that it abstains for the most part from giving absolute powers to the Department. That has been the general tendency in the legislation which is proposed to us, and I believe it is to be found in the corresponding Bill which is not in this House. But I am glad to say that I do not see more than one occasion on which that objection can be taken to this Bill.<lb/>
If the noble Lord will look at Subsection (2) of Clause 13 he will see that power is given to a man to sell a tuber-
<col>514</col>
culous cow; and all he has to do when I parting with that valuable animal is to&#x2014;
<quote>"give notice of such disposal to the medical officer of health of the district in which the dairy is situated, specifying the destination of the animal and stating the name and address of the person to whom it is consigned."</quote>
If the noble Lord will look at the Order, on which I shall have to say a word in a moment, he will find that a man is there prohibited, very properly I think, from parting with these animals. They have first of all to be examined, and then, if found infected with tuberculosis, have to be slaughtered. That seems to me inconsistent with the subsection to which I have just referred. I think the mode of dealing with the urban authority intruding upon the rural authority is in accordance with the regulation which prevails at the present time, and I am glad that the noble Lord has preserved it; it has worked very well so far as I am aware, and it is the sensible way of dealing with what is confessedly one of the greatest difficulties with regard to milk traffic.<lb/>
There is another point I should like to bring to the noble Lord's notice. While laying down stringent conditions with regard to the examination and inspection of milk, butter, cheese, and so on, in Scotland, there is nothing in the Bill which imposes any similar restrictions or special inspection with regard to these articles coming from abroad. I have been informed that butter is very nearly as dangerous as milk. A great deal of butter does come from abroad, and it is very desirable that the same sort of inspection should be applied to foreign butter as is applied to Scottish butter. That is, I think, all on this point that it is necessary for me to trouble your Lordships with at this stage. I shall no doubt put down some Amendments for Committee, and then I shall, perhaps, speak at rather greater length.<lb/>
But there is one point to which I wish to call the attention of the House, and that is Clause 25, by which all expenses incurred by the local authority for the purposes of this Bill are to be chargeable on the public health general assessment. That introduces a very large and important subject. The way in which rates are being piled up is really getting beyond human endurance. I do not say that any Government is free from just accusation on this subject, but I
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0261"/>
<col>515</col>
believe the present Government has sinned in this particular direction more than any Government that ever existed. Take the additions which are actually being put on at this moment. You have a large expenditure being placed on the ratepayers for medical examination of children; then there is the expense for the staffing of schools; and an enormous expenditure is going to be entailed upon the ratepayers by the Housing and Town Planning Bill&#x2014;really the most formidable of all. But in this matter of milk, which really cannot be said to affect the ratepayers solely, and, indeed, is not so important to the ratepayers as it is to the general public, you are going to impose not one burden but two. An Order, dated May 25, has recently been issued by the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;this Order, of course, they have power to enforce by Statute&#x2014;which is going to impose upon the ratepayers the whole of the expense of compensating persons who have tuberculous cows that are slaughtered. Dr Nathan Raw, who, I believe, is a great authority on this question, speaking the other day, said he understood there were between 200,000 and 300,000 tuberculous cows in this country. The proposal in that Order is that within a comparatively short time those cows are to be slaughtered and the expense is to fall upon the rates.<lb/>
The Board of Agriculture are well aware of the heavy burden they are going to impose on the ratepayers, and, very wisely, do not attempt to conceal it. In the letter which covers the Order it is stated that they are well aware that the initial expense must be very heavy. They say that they made the Order only after very careful consideration of the liabilities thrown on local authorities, but they add that they believe public opinion is favourable to the adoption of concerted measures, and so on. I believe they are quite correct in that. But just think what the expense will be. I do not know whether the President of the Board of Agriculture has formed any estimate of the expense, but if all these cows are to be slaughtered within the next two or three years the rate will have to be reckoned, not in pence, but almost in shillings. We cannot, as I have said, touch this Order, and the enormous expense of carrying it out falls upon the ratepayers.<lb/>
Then we come to this Bill. It becomes a question, when this enormous expense is going to be thrown on the ratepayers,
<col>516</col>
whether we are justified in going further and placing upon them the expenditure for veterinary officials and other expenses incurred under this Bill. I hope that when we reach the next stage of the Bill the noble Lord will be in a position to tell us that a portion, at all events&#x2014;a considerable portion it ought to be&#x2014;of this expenditure will be met by the State. As I have said, this question of milk is not one which affects the ratepayers solely, or, indeed, principally. It affects the whole country, and it is therefore not fair, as it seems to me, to impose the burden upon a limited class. I do not ask the noble Lord to give me any reply now, but I hope that at the next stage of the Bill he will be in a position to make some reassuring statement to the House; and if he does not do so we must reserve to ourselves full liberty as to what future action we may deem it necessary to take in the interests of the ratepayers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00856"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to take any part in the discussion on this Bill, except to ask the noble Earl a question arising out of the last part of his speech. I have certainly no desire to dispute the statement that heavy burdens fall upon the ratepayers, and that where possible in certain cases we should all be glad to see them relieved from general public sources. But it is with regard to the particular question of the number of cows which would have to be slaughtered under the proposed conditions that I desire to ask him a question. The noble Earl mentioned the number as something between 200,000 and 300,000 that would have to be slaughtered.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00858"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: What I wanted to ask the noble Earl was whether these were cows that were tuberculous simply to the extent of reacting to the tuberculin test, or whether they were cows which come under the definition of cows that ought to be slaughtered&#x2014;namely, cows which actually have tuberculosis of the udder or are so emaciated by tuberculosis as to give milk that is contaminated. I confess I cannot believe that the number of those cows reaches anything approaching 200,000.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00859"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: As I have said, the statement I made is not my own but that of an eminent doctor. I think those of your Lordships who are acquainted with the country must be well aware that there is a great deal of tuberculosis in cows, and that the more highly bred the herds are the larger, unfortunately, is the amount of tuberculosis. I cannot vouch for this number of 200,000. All I can say is that I have seen an enormous number of tuberculous cows myself, and I expect other noble Lords have had a similar experience. Every one connected with agriculture is well aware that this disease is very widely prevalent indeed, and I think a deputation from the Central Chamber of Agriculture waited upon a Minister to-day with reference to that very matter. I am afraid that if the noble Earl thinks the amount of tuberculosis is small he will find that he is greatly mistaken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00860"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not at all dispute that, but my point was that a distinction should be drawn between cows which are technically tuberculous because they react to the test, and cows which ought to be destroyed forthwith because they give tuberculous milk.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00869"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> moved to amend Clause 1, which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"From and after the passing of this Act it shall not be lawful to land or sell in the United Kingdom any fish caught by the methods of fishing known as beam trawling and otter trawling within prohibited areas as defined in this Act and fish so caught within such areas shall be added to the table of prohibitions and restrictions contained in section forty-two of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876 and upon being brought to land in the United Kingdom shall be dealt with as goods imported and brought into the United Kingdom contrary to the said prohibitions and restrictions,"</quote>
by adding, at the end, the following proviso&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that nothing in this Act shall operate to impose liability to any other penalties under the Customs Consolidation Act 1876 in respect of the importation of prohibited goods."</quote>
The Amendment was necessary because, as he believed, certain clauses of the Customs Consolidation Act which were not referred to in the Bill would come into operation in a manner not contemplated by those who were answerable for the Bill. The effect of Clause 1 of the Bill was to add fish to the list of prohibitions and restrictions under section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act. Under that section the fish could simply be confiscated; but if their Lordships turned to Clause 172 of the same Act they would see it was there laid down that if any vessel or boat should be used in the importation, landing, carriage or so forth of any prohibited goods, which would now include fish, in certain circumstances the owners might be liable to a penalty involving the forfeiture of a boat not exceeding the value of &#x00A3;500. He could not believe it was the intention of noble Lords to subject boats which carried fish to that penalty, and therefore he had put down the Amendment, which he believed would remove all doubt on the subject.</p>

I may say frankly there is no intention whatever of putting into force the further sections to which the noble Duke has drawn attention. But we are following in this case a precedent that has been adopted in the case of other articles which have been added to the prohibitions of the Customs Consolidation Act. Numerous articles have from time to time been added, and I think the last case was that of prison-made goods. The Scottish Office have in this matter acted in close consultation with the Customs authorities, and it is with their entire concurrence and approval that the Department have taken the course they have done in this Bill.<lb/>
The Department consider that the exclusion which the noble Duke desires might weaken the executive powers of the Customs officers when they wish to board and detain vessels carrying not only illegally-trawled catches, as they would in this case, but in the case of the other articles to which I have alluded. They therefore concurred with the Scottish Office in desiring that the Bill should stand as it does. I may again repeat my assurance that it is not intended that the clause to which objection is taken shall be put into force against the vessels in question. It is literally and precisely sufficient for the Department's purpose that the first section should be put into force; but, after consultation, the Customs authorities desired that we should follow the precedent repeatedly adopted in other cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00872"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said it was rather a late hour to enter into an argument on such a small point, but he did not know whether the remarks of the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland were satisfactory to the Committee. It seemed a strange proceeding to keep up these tremendous powers of forfeiting a boat up to the value of &#x00A3;500 merely for the reason that they had some fish on board which they ought not to have when it was never intended that the powers should be exercised. Surely it was a very slovenly way of legislating to have huge powers in operation in the sense of their being part of a Statute which they had not the smallest intention of putting into force. The case of prison-made goods, quoted by the Secretary for Scotland, did not seem to him quite to the point. The
<col>520</col>
inclusion of fish was not a question of Customs at all. Fish had nothing to do with taxation, and it seemed to him that the Customs ought not to have any voice in the matter. If they were going to put these unhappy trawlers under the Bill in the way proposed they should at least put them in the position of knowing what they were liable to. All they had to trust to at present was a verbal expression of an intention &#x2014;a perfectly genuine intention, no doubt&#x2014;that these powers should not be put in force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00873"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may be allowed to supplement what I have said, I should like to point out to the noble Duke that the intentions will be more than verbally expressed. The Customs will act in this matter on the initiative of the Fishery Board, and will act, therefore, on instructions given by that Board. The noble Duke has alluded to prison-made goods, and he asked why the Customs should have anything to do with the matter at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00874"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I meant with fish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00875"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I agree. The Customs, I may say, are our only machinery for preventing the landing of any goods we do not wish to have landed. That is the reason why the Customs are employed in this case. The danger of the objectionable sections being put into operation is still further lessened by this consideration, that the sections have never hitherto been put into operation against non-dutiable goods, and in that category both prison-made goods and fish would fall. It would be entirely a breach of precedent if the Customs authorities were to put into force these objectionable sections against trawled fish. I think I can safely assure your Lordships that there is not the least possibility that there would be any breach of the practice which has hitherto been followed by the Customs in all such matters. I would, therefore, on behalf of my own Department, but not less on behalf of the Customs, who desire that there should be no breach of their practice in this matter, ask your Lordships to consider what I have said on the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00876"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> could not see the object of putting in these sections, but suggested to the noble Duke that he should leave his Amendment over until the Report stage. In the mean time there would be an oppor-

<col>521</col>
tunity for further consideration of the subject, and perhaps when the Bill was again before the House the discussion might take place at a little earlier period of the evening.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00877"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether my noble friend wishes to press the point, but I would remind him that it is one of those minor points on which, as a rule, we defer to the wishes of the Department. I confess I think that if the noble Lord opposite wishes to make his laws and regulations easily intelligible to these fishermen it would seem better to deal with the whole question in the Bill than to have one half of the regulations in an Act of Parliament and another half Departmental regulations. It should not be difficult to make it clear that people who contravene the provisions of the Act would be liable to have their fish forfeited but not their vessel. What will happen now is that they will have to scan the Bill, which will tell them that their fish will be forfeited, and then they will have to look in the Departmental regulations to find that their vessel will not be forfeited also.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00878"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said he would withdraw his Amendment at this juncture, and bring it up again on the Report stage.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00881">Clause 2:</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00882"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> asked if the Secretary for Scotland held that in the event of a foreign fishing boat carrying fish caught in the Moray Firth to a foreign port and discharging that fish into a vessel which brought it to England, the fish would come within the prohibition of the Bill, or was the Bill only to provide for the case of fish being transferred from one trawler to another as was not uncommon in the North Sea. If it was the latter the Bill was intelligible, but if it was intended to apply to the case of a trawler taking fish to a foreign port where it was put on board a vessel in the ordinary course of trade, say a boat from Ostend to London, he thought they would be carrying the Bill to a very dangerous extent. It would mean
<col>522</col>
giving a very dangerous power to the Scottish Fishery Board. At present all he wanted to know was, what was the exact intention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00883"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the exact intention is that if a trawler is sent in the Moray Firth for two months that trawler shall not be allowed to land and sell its fish in this country. I should think the Bill covers both the cases which the noble Lord mentioned; but the second case which he puts is not thought to be a practicable procedure. If the fish is landed in Ostend, we will say, and sold, so far as the original trawler is concerned it is done with. It is certainly meant to cover the first case which the noble Lord put.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00884"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> said it certainly did that, but what he wanted to know was whether it covered the second one, because it was a dangerous power to give the Scottish Fishery Board. Take the case of a Belgian trawler. It caught fish in the Moray Firth and conveyed them to its port of origin&#x2014;namely, Ostend&#x2014;and at Ostend the fish were put on board another vessel for the purpose of being taken to England in the ordinary course of trade. Would it be in the power of the Fishery Board to notify the Customs that that particular vessel was not to be allowed to land her fish?</p>

<title>CROFTING PARISHES (SCOTLAND) BILL.<lb/> [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00936" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00937">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00938"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill was before your Lordships last year, and it has been reprinted in exactly the same form in which it went down to another place. The Bill claims to be an attempt to tackle the main difficulties which exist in questions of Highland land at the present day. It attempts to face and redress the disabilities and anomalies under which crofters in the crofting parishes are labouring to-day. It attempts to give the possibility of increasing existing holdings, and also, which is more important, to make possible the formation of new holdings. The Bill also attempts to simplify the existing administration, and to give a possibility for the inauguration of new enterprises which might be done under what is now the Congested Districts Board.<lb/>
I may say that this Bill has been constructed with the advice of both those who own the land and those who occupy it, and that it takes into full consideration those points of importance which act as natural limitations to any scheme for increasing small holdings in the Highland area. I refer to the question of wintering, the question of employment, and the question of rates. It is very easy for anyone to tilt at deer forests as they exist to-day, to tilt at those questions of sporting interests which are only the pleasures of the rich, and fail to recognise the benefits these bring to the people who dwell in the Highlands, and how absolutely and vitally they are mixed up in the life of the majority of the small holders there.<lb/>
The question of employment, one must admit, is the first question one has to look to in facing the crofter problem. We have in the Highlands practically no industries which go on the year through, and the crofter holdings are so small that they do not of themselves support the inhabitants. Therefore for the men to live they have to make their work outside what they raise on the croft. I take directly out of the Bill of the Secretary for Scotland the proposed money grant for the encouragement of afforestation and for development on the lines of co-operation. I believe that
<col>530</col>
afforestation, whether it is undertaken by a central board or under the Scottish Office, will be in the future the only line on which we can ever hope to bring more men into the valleys, and under this Bill it is suggested that the grant indicated in Lord Pentland's Bill should be spent in the crofting parish areas.<lb/>
The next matter of importance in regarding the crofter question is that of wintering. The majority of your Lordships, no doubt, see the Highlands in the summer time when the grass grows to the tops of the hills, when the cattle are turned out day and night, and when the whole country looks prosperous. I do not expect the majority of your Lordships have seen those upland districts in the winter time, when the whole of the villages are shut off for days and even weeks from the railways and low ground, when the whole of the cattle stock has to be housed, and when the old ewe stock is all that is able to brave the elements, and that only on the lower slopes of the hills. I suppose fewer of you have seen those conditions in the springtime&#x2014;in April&#x2014;when in England or in the south country the grass has already made its appearance. In this part of Scotland they have to wait sometimes three and even four weeks before a head of cattle can win a scanty living outside. It is in relation to this question of wintering, and, therefore, the amount of arable ground taken in connection with hinterland, that the crofter question must be studied. It is impossible to break up farms where the amount of arable land is small if you have no keep to offer for beasts during the winter months. The big sheep farmers require a great deal of capital in order that the sheep may be removed from these mountain lands for wintering, sometimes a distance of 200 miles. If you turn some of these farms into crofter holdings, it cannot be expected that the crofters who would take the place of the large farmers would have the necessary capital either to purchase suitable sheep stock or winter it when bought.<lb/>
The third point we have to consider in looking at any extension of small holdings in the Highland area is the question of rates. This is no doubt a vexed question throughout the country, but in the Highlands it strikes with particular force. Where the owners' and occupiers' rates run, as they do in some of the poorer parishes, from 17s. 6d. up to 19s. in the &#x00A3;&#x2014;14s. being, comparatively speaking, a common
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0269"/>
<col>531</col>
occurrence&#x2014;the question of what rates have to be paid and the narrow margin between absolutely being able to carry on at all or not comes out with striking force. Any increase of poor population must increase the rates. Not only are there the questions of schools and poor rates, but there is the further consideration, that as the crofter does not pay any rates on his dwelling-house but only on his land he is only rated on a portion of the holding, and therefore the more farms split up the greater the contraction of revenue-producing subjects.<lb/>
We see in this country considerable anxiety expressed when the Budget proposes an increase of 6d. in the &#x00A3;. I can assure you that any hasty legislation in Scotland which might reduce the number of paying interests, such as sheep farms and sporting values, might lead in certain parishes to an increase in the rates, calculated by shillings not sixpences in the pound. It must not be forgotten that in many parishes in the Highland area sixty per cent. of the rates are paid by sporting interests and sheep farmers. I bring these points forward to show that the crofter question can be only approached with care, foresight, and considerable local knowledge. I do not for a moment pretend that we alone have got in this Bill this knowledge, but I do contend that these facts have been carefully kept before us in framing the Bill, and we have gone as far as anyone can reasonably expect in an endeavour to face the difficulties which exist and the grievances which the crofters have, which we certainly wish to reduce if we possibly can.<lb/>
The Bill does not require much description. The points which have been already mentioned here I need hardly go over again. In the Bill certain disabilities under which the crofters labour have been removed. We have practically permitted the whole of leaseholders to come under the scope of the Crofters Act, 1886. We have given them power to hire their houses out for summer lodgings or practically any other work they wish, and we have given them clauses by which they should come under the provisions regarding compensation for game. We have put no further duties upon these crofters except that where they hire their houses out for summer visitors they can be rated on their houses, and that they should be bound to make
<col>532</col>
the necessary sanitary arrangements, provided the landlord gets no payment for such houses.<lb/>
Then we have given facilities for an increase of existing holdings. The only real difference that lies between our proposals and the Government's proposals is this, that we make it a perfectly fair Bill and that proper compensation is paid, not only for the part of the holding taken but also for the surplus land. As to the question of new holdings, the main idea in this Bill is taken from Lord Camperdown's Bill which he has already introduced in your Lordships' House, the only difference being that the executive authority instead of being the county council is in this Bill the Crofters Commission. The Crofters Commission has for a number of years administered affairs in the Highlands. It is a well-known executive body, and we consider it is a body which ought to be able to take up this work satisfactorily. The Crofters Commission, in readjusting rents, have really ludicrously little work to do at the present time. I have not the figures for this year, but in previous years I do not think the difference of rents adjusted amounted to more than &#x00A3;100 in the whole year's work.<lb/>
We further take up the question of amalgamating the Congested Districts Board and the Crofters Commission in one board. At the present time in another place there is considerable criticism of the action of the Congested Districts Board. I do not wish to enter into that here, but I do desire to point out that anyone who has wished to divide land among crofters has had his difficulty considerably increased by having to deal with two boards rather than with one authority; and I feel certain that putting these two boards together would mean more effective work. Then the Congested Districts Board being handed over, there would be one member added for the purpose of taking up forestal matters. I think that all of us who have read the Report of the Forestry Commission lately published would be satisfied that it is, at all events, a question which is well worthy of study in the Highlands. I do not for a moment wish to subscribe to the whole of the findings of that Committee; but even if only a very small fraction of the figures they have given is correct as regards area of ground that can be planted, and if the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0270"/>
<col>533</col>
return from forest land is only half what they say it might eventually be, you will see there are great prospects for forestry work on the low-value land of which the majority of the crofter parishes consist.<lb/>
As I say, this is a Bill which does not very much differ, except in form, from what the wishes of the Government appear to be on the subject of crofter reform. I think we can claim that if we have not a certain number of the representatives of the crofters in another place entirely on our side, at all events by the legislation which they have put forward they wish to work on parallel, if not very similar, lines. The question of removing the anomalies of the existing 1886 Act, the question of creating economic holdings, and the question of expansion of the areas at present held by crofters&#x2014;these are the three essential ideas we wish to get forward, and these, I submit, are brought out in this Bill. Whether the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland will see his way to support the Bill I have not the least idea. I can only say that if he does not support this measure the only reason can be that he is so wedded to proposals which have been twice refused by this House that he still puts forward his own scheme, which, from what we have seen, is not likely to pass, and refuses a scheme which, having passed this House once, I think we may confidently expect may pass this House again.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00940"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in a little difficulty this afternoon, and I daresay some of your Lordships are in the same difficulty, for there are upon the business Paper of the House two Bills, one in the name of Lord Camperdown and the other in the name of the noble Lord who has just sat down, both dealing with the problem of amending crofter legislation for Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00941"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No; my Bill deals with small holdings, not crofts.</membercontribution></p>

<col>534</col>
of Scotland. I am at a loss to know, therefore, to use what is a colloquial phrase, on which leg those who are opposed to the Government policy mean to stand on this matter. I should like, if I may, to be allowed to make a few observations on the general subject before I deal with the provisions of the Bill which the noble Lord has laid before your Lordships. I am grateful to him for this opportunity of making such observations, and I am grateful to your Lordships for being willing again to consider what is, in the opinion of the Government, not only an important but a pressing question.<lb/>
We all know the high esteem in which Lord Lovat is held in the Highlands, and it is a profound regret to me&#x2014;I say so perfectly sincerely&#x2014;that I find myself in opposition to him on this occasion; for I am in no doubt whatever as to his public-spirited intentions in this matter, and I would greatly have preferred finding myself in agreement with him. Your Lordships, too, many of you, have great knowledge and practical experience of the management of land to which I can lay no claim whatever. But it has been my duty, holding the office which I have the honour to hold, to study and endeavour to master this question, and having lived in Scotland all my life, I am not altogether unacquainted, though I do not pretend to dogmatise about it, with the conditions of the subject.<lb/>
I cannot help believing that we start from different sets of facts in this matter, or there could not be such great differences. I should like, with your Lordships' permission, to endeavour to try and remove some of these differences in order to place your Lordships in possession of the standpoint or the view of the Government in this matter. There are several what I may without offence term misconceptions. I do not attribute all or any of them to your Lordships or to any particular persons. They are possibly not shared by your Lordships, but, unhappily, they have been emphasised and deepened during this controversy, which has lasted something like three years, and they do obscure a true understanding of this question. I remember last year that when Lord Lovat introduced this Bill in your Lordships' House&#x2014;and he has alluded to that consideration again to day&#x2014;he expressed the view that the work of the Crofters Commission had
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0271"/>
<col>535</col>
practically come to an end. He said that it cost &#x00A3;5,000 a year, that the amount of fair rents fixed by it was very small, and that it was evident that its work was approaching an end. Last year, of course, there were special causes for the small output of work of the Crofters Commission; and when I speak of last year I mean the work which was reported last year&#x2014;namely, the work of the previous year. The Chairman of the Commission, who has since died, was then suffering from an illness which had continued a longtime, and the work of the Commission was hindered by the fact that his presence was required for hearing appeals. I think the results will be somewhat different this year. I do not, however, pretend to say that there is not some force in the criticism of the noble Lord. In time the work of the Commission in fixing rents must be limited, especially if no new holdings are being created; but if the powers of the Crofters Act were extended, as we deem they should be and as we have endeavoured to extend them, the work in respect of fixing rents for new holdings and in respect of fixing rents for enlargement of existing holdings would develop and continue.<lb/>
I must remind your Lordships of a still more important consideration, and it is this. The Crofters Commission is an integral part of the crofter system, and I am sure no one who knows the Highlands will deny consideration to the view that the crofter system is a guarantee, which we could not lightly dispense with, for the peace, the well-being, and the prosperity of the Highlands. The first observation then which I would venture to make is that the Crofters Commission and the crofter system are established facts in Scotland, and it is impossible to discuss this question of crofters, and of crofts or small holdings, call them what you will, without recognising that fact. Another misconception&#x2014;I believe it to be a misconception&#x2014;is the identification of the crofter system with the system of the Irish Land Act, 1881, and such legislation. I am not sure that that criticism is, even if it were admitted, so powerful as it might seem at first sight. That Irish legislation, after all, recognised and applied throughout Ireland the conditions of tenure which characterised the most prosperous, the most energetic, and the most enterprising portion of the farming community
<col>536</col>
in Ireland; but there are wide differences, my Lords, between the crofter system and the system to which I have alluded in Ireland. There are differences in the form of the tribunal, in the procedure, in the cost, in the absence of an appeal from the decision of the tribunal, and also, on the other hand, in the form of tenure, notably by the absence from the Scottish tenure of all free sale. I would make this further observation, whatever your opinion may be of the comparison to which I have alluded, that it is quite undeniable that the Scottish system has not led to the same results as have been apparent in Ireland.<lb/>
If I may briefly recognise another misconception, Lewis and Barra are not typical of the whole of the Highlands of Scotland. The noble Lord alluded to them last year and said that squatting was going on and that affairs were going from bad to worse. It is the case there. There is the further characteristic that in Barra and Lewis, alone of all the rural parishes in Scotland almost, the population is increasing. Lewis and Barra are not typical even of the Outer Islands, far less of the Highlands of Scotland or of the crofting counties in the Highlands.<lb/>
I come now, if I may, to two proposals upon which the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition in this House based last year his fatal opposition to the Government Bill. He described the crofter system as a failure. He used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"We have denied from the first that the crofter legislation has been on the whole of a successful nature even in those areas where it has been applied."</quote>
And he repeated that statement in even stronger terms on the 6th of this month in the discussion on Lord Camperdown's Bill, when he stated that the crofter system had actually led to a most disastrous state of things in Scotland. The noble Marquess said&#x2014; <quote>"We have it in the evidence from numerous sources that the crofter system has led to agriculture more miserable and to conditions of existence more squalid and wretched than any other system with which we are familiar in these islands,"</quote>
thus actually attributing to the existence of the crofter system the worsening, the further degradation, of Highland conditions now as compared with the year 1886 when the crofter system was established.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0272"/>
<col>537</col>
Now I am quite willing, and I am sure anybody who knows the conditions must be quite willing, to admit that in the farm stock of the crofters, in the methods of cultivation, in the marketing, in the system of farming generally, there is much room for improvement in the crofter area. But I should be grateful to be enlightened as to what foundation there is for the statement&#x2014;and I take the more moderate of the two statements&#x2014;that the crofter legislation has not been a success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00943"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: This Bill is founded on the Crofters Act, and therefore the question whether the crofter legislation is a success or not is beside the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00944"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am quite aware that it is the intention of the noble Lord to develop and extend the crofter system, but my belief&#x2014;and I think I shall be able to make it good to your Lordships&#x2014;is that this Bill has precisely the reverse effect, and I am anxious, therefore, to give your Lordships some testimony to rebut the very powerful authority of the noble Marquess who has expressed an opinion condemnatory of the crofter system. I am very loath to detain your Lordships or to speak at greater length than you would wish, and I will make my observations as brief as possible; but I would remind your Lordships that this condemnation of the crofter system was based very largely&#x2014;I do not presume to say wholly&#x2014;on the Report of what the noble Marquess called the Douglas Commission. The Douglas Commission was a party of gentlemen who early last year or the year before, I forget which, travelled through the Highlands for, I think, something like a fortnight or three weeks. Most of the members of that party were already committed&#x2014;publicly committed&#x2014;as opposed to the Government Bill dealing with this question. We are all well aware in Scotland of the circumstances under which they travelled through the Highlands, and I cannot believe that if the noble Marquess were fully acquainted with those circumstances he would attach such overwhelming importance to their evidence, bearing in mind that the time which they devoted to the purpose could not possibly avail them to make a real examination of the circumstances. I cannot believe that their evidence should be so overwhelming as to negative all the documents that have been laid before
<col>538</col>
Parliament since the year 1886, when the Crofters Commission was established.<lb/>
If the Crofters Commission is thought to be interested in praising its own work, let me refer your Lordships to the Deer Forest Commission, which reported on the whole of the Highlands of Scotland, after two years work, in the year 1895. Their words are&#x2014;
<quote>"We deem it right to place on record the result of our observations as to the effect of the Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886. Our inspection of land throughout the counties mentioned brought us into intimate proximity with many crofting townships, as well as with the individual holdings of many crofters, and, accordingly, we derived materials for judgment from a very large portion of the crofting area&#x2014;</quote>
I may interpolate that this was a unanimously signed Report and that the Commission contained members representing all political parties&#x2014;
<quote>"Our opinion is that, speaking generally, the Act has had a beneficial effect, and particularly in the following directions. In the first place, the fixing of a fair rent has to a large extent removed from the minds of crofters the sense of hardship arising from the belief that they were made to pay rent on their own improvements, or otherwise made to pay at an excessive rate for soil of a poor quality. In the second place, the combination of a fair rent with statutory security of tenure has not only taken away or allayed causes of discontent, but has imparted a new spirit to crofters, and imbued them with fresh energy. The abiding sense produced that the permanent improvements which a crofter makes upon his holding will, if he complies with certain reasonable statutory conditions, accrue either to himself or to his family successor, will not be taxable by the landlord in the form of increased rent, and, moreover, will have a money value under a claim for compensation or renunciation of tenancy or removal from his holding, has led to vigorous efforts towards improvement by crofters in many quarters. For instance, we found that more attention is being paid to cultivation, to rotation of crops, to reclamation of outruns, to fencing, and to the formation or repair of township roads; but most conspicuous of all effects perceptible is that upon buildings, including both dwelling-houses and steadings."</quote>
And so the Report goes on. The real truth is&#x2014;at any rate, it is the view of the Government founded on a fairly careful examination of the facts&#x2014;that not only is the Crofters Commission and the Crofters Act largely responsible for the peace and order which now reign throughout the Highlands, but the security for rents thereby given has been an advantage to proprietors. We know that great improvements have been made in the housing of the crofters, something like &#x00A3;160,000&#x2014;that is a moderate
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0273"/>
<col>539</col>
estimate &#x2014;having been expended on the improvement of their houses. Many of them have risen from crofters to be farmers of large farms, and many of their sons have entered the various professions. Two men were pointed out to me recently when I visited a well known University as of the most promising of their class, and they came from small crofts. The noble Lord smiles. I quite agree that it is a domestic feature, but it bears out what the Report says, that there has been instilled in the crofter population a desire for self-improvement and an ambition which is worthy of all praise.<lb/>
Let me, if I may, say a word on the distinction which the noble Earl is frequently fond of drawing between a crofter and a small holder. The noble Marquess expressed great surprise the other day when I ventured to say in this House that when they are working under the same conditions there is no essential difference between a crofter and a small holder. I will endeavour to explain what I meant. The noble Marquess takes a different view. Speaking in your Lordships' House on March 11, 1908, the noble Marquess said&#x2014;
<quote>"We conceive that there is au essential distinction between crofters and farmers who are not crofters&#x2026;What was essential in a crofter was that he should have a hereditary and prescriptive tenure, and that he, and not his landlord, should have been in the habit of making the improvements on his holdings.&#x2026; The crofter is the man who <i>de facto</i> has already established a proprietary right upon the farm."</quote>
I am not concerned to question the historical ground upon which the advocacy of the Crofters Act was based by the late Lord Kinross in the House of Commons. That consideration was emphasised by the late Lord Salisbury in your Lordships' House. But I wish to point out, and to emphasise, some further facts which I think are incontestable.<lb/>
In the first place, may I remind your Lordships that there is not one word in the Crofters Act itself about hereditary tenure&#x2014;not one word. The definition of a crofter in that Act runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Any person who at the passing of this Act is tenant of a holding from year to year, who resides on a holding, the annual rent of which is under &#x00A3;30, situated in a crofting parish."</quote>
The early words are "any person," so that as the Act came into force in June, 1886, any person who at that time was the
<col>540</col>
tenant of a holding in a crofting parish became admitted to the benefits of that Act. There were numerous cases of men admitted to the benefits of the Act who had no hereditary claim whatever. Then let me instance another class of persons who have been admitted to the Act. There are numerous instances of persons who have secured entry to holdings since 1886 and who have been accepted by Highland proprietors as crofters. I admit that if the proprietors had taken objection these crofters could never have acquired statutory rights, but by the goodwill of the proprietors there have been numerous cases of crofters who have obtained statutory rights, particularly, I believe, on the Sutherland estates and other estates. Further, there are numerous tenants who have been established as crofters and given the statutory crofter tenure by the operations of the Congested Districts Board co-operating with proprietors. All these classes are statutory crofters whatever may have been the ground upon which this legislation was advocated. Both in 1886 and since that year there have been numerous classes of men admitted to this crofter tenure who, so far as hereditary claim is concerned, are indistinguishable from any other farmers in Scotland.<lb/>
A share in common pasture is often considered as the indispensable characteristic of a crofter holding, but that is not the case. There are many districts, especially on the West Coast, in which common pasture is the rule, but there are numbers of places, especially on the East Coast, where there is no share whatever in common pasture, and, therefore, in that respect also, there is no difference between the crofter in individual occupancy of a small arable farm and the man over the fence who has no statutory rights, who is also in individual occupancy of his farm, and who is called a farmer. The arable land in the Highlands, as the noble Lord knows, is of small extent in proportion to the grazing, and it would not be practicable, owing to the quality and character of the land, to assign a share in common grazing to crofters. All up the East Coast common grazings are exceedingly rare.<lb/>
If your Lordships will allow me, I would like to give the facts which will bear out the statements I have ventured to make. In 1888 the Commissioners held sittings at Beauly and heard applications from
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0274"/>
<col>541</col>
the parishes of Kirkhill, Kiltarlity, and Kilmorack, and fixed fair rents for 148 holdings there. They extended to 1,522 acres arable and 1,358 acres outrun, and the fair rents were fixed at &#x00A3;830 5s. 6d. One of the tenants was interested to the extent of one-half in a common pasture of ninety-one acres. All the rest were tenants of crofts held in individual occupancy, and without any common pasture. Taking next the county of Ross and Cromarty, the Commissioners held sittings in Dingwall in 1888 and heard applications from fifteen estates in the neighbourhood and in the district commonly known as the Black Isle. Fair rents were fixed for 139 holdings. Twelve of these, along with four others, included an interest in a common pasture of 227 acres; all the rest were holdings possessed in individual occupancy and without common pasture. I have figures here of five out of the seven crofting counties, which show that in numerous cases these crofters have no common pasture but are the owners and occupiers of individual farms just as ordinary farmers.<lb/>
These holdings are numerous. The hereditary theory did not enter into the matter, and there are these classes of tenants to be found in every one of the crofter counties. At any rate in five I have the evidence before me at this moment. The importance of it is not that it is known to the Government, but that it is known throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. It has helped to mould public opinion on this question there, and it is unquestionably the fact that the system has a firm hold on public opinion in Scotland. It not only has a firm hold, but it is regarded there as a Scottish development, the fruit of Scottish circumstances and Scottish experience, and in that as having brought great benefits to Scotland and especially to the Highlands. In hundreds and hundreds of cases&#x2014;and this is the statement which I should like to submit to the noble Marquess&#x2014;at least in five of the crofting counties, the conditions under which the statutory crofter works and farms his holding are indistinguishable from those of the ordinary farmer, large or small, except in two particulars&#x2014;the statutory crofter makes his own improvements and has fixity of tenure. Obviously this has two bearings. It has a bearing on the subject matter of the noble Lord's Bill, and has a wider bearing on legislation for the whole of Scotland. If I may be
<col>542</col>
allowed, I will make some observations in this light on the noble Lord's Bill. This Bill&#x2014;I say so simply as a fact, and not to give any offence&#x2014;is the second edition of the noble Lord's proposals. He proposed certain Amendments last year which transformed the character of his Bill, the object of these Amendments being, if I mistake him not, to set up machinery to provide new holdings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00945"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00946"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: And I thank the noble Lord for doing us the courtesy of adopting I think about twelve clauses of the Government Bill. To those clauses, therefore, I need make no allusion. The original proposal of this House in Lord Camperdown's Bill was that new holdings should be created all over Scotland, including the crofter area, through the county councils. The Bill now before us proposes that the powers provided in Lord Camperdown's Bill for the county councils should be given in the crofting districts to the Crofters Commission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00947"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: For crofts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00948"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That is the practical effect of the proposal. The authority has been changed, but the scheme remains the same, and I note there is no provision in the Bill for giving to these new holdings the crofting tenure. It offers instead a system for which I venture to say there is no evidence whatever of a demand, and, so far as purchase goes, they are not likely, I think, to take advantage of it on any terms. On the other hand, the crofter tenure which is proposed by the Government is simple, easily worked, cheap, well-known, and popular.<lb/>
The next observation I would make upon the noble Lord's Bill is this. He alluded to the Bill as strengthening the position of the Crofters Commission. He adopts the Crofters Commission for certain purposes, but he really deprives it of the character which it has hitherto borne. He described it to-day as an administrative body. It has certain very small and limited administrative functions, but I believe that if the antithesis is to be raised it is far more correct to describe the Crofters Commission as a judicial body than an administrative body. It is in that respect
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0275"/>
<col>543</col>
that the noble Lord's proposals damage the Crofters Commission because he seeks to impose upon that Commission, which hitherto has been regarded as a judicial body, and which, as a judicial body, is subject to no appeal to a higher Court, duties of an administrative character which would greatly prejudice its position as a judicial authority.<lb/>
The noble Lord introduces the system of an individual valuer to take the place of the Crofters Commission in valuing these new holdings. I am not going to argue that question. It has been argued before in your Lordships' House. The comparative advantages of an individual private valuer and valuation by a statutory body have been argued here by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack; but I would ask whether it is a wise proposal to take from the Highlands the services of a tribunal in which they have confidence, whose decisions I do not think have ever been the subject of any pronounced or general attack, which has done its work to the satisfaction generally of both tenants and proprietors&#x2014;is it, I ask, a practical and wise proposal to take from the Highlands that tried and experienced, and, I would say, impartial, tribunal, and substitute for it the services of individual valuers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00949"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Is the noble Lord talking of the Congested Districts Board or of the Commission?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00950"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I understand they are amalgamated in Lord Lovat's Bill. That is precisely the operation to which I take great exception, and I cannot see where the advantages of the single valuer come in. Has the practice of employing valuers to value the interests in sheep farms been so very successful that we should abandon a tried system in order to adopt it? I am, therefore, by the facts obliged to take exception also to this proposal. There are two other clauses in the Bill to which I take objection. Clause 2 is one of the clauses adopted from the Government Bill in regard to auxiliary occupation. The noble Lord alluded to it in his opening remarks, but subsection (4), which was not in the Government Bill and is meant to provide that all crofters in future shall pay a rate on all improvements other than agricultural improvements, I cannot consider an improvement in this Bill. The
<col>544</col>
rating system of the country may be good or bad. It may or it may not deserve amendment. It is not likely to make a Bill of this kind acceptable to the crofters when they are aware that by this provision the Bill imposes a new liability and a new burden upon them. Clause 3 does the same thing in regard to all existing crofters as well as new holders&#x2014;imposes a rate for sanitary improvements.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00951"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: That is in your Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00952"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: But the noble Lord will find that in the Government Bill it is limited to new holdings. It is not a new burden placed upon those with whom the State has already made its bargain. Then I would like to say a word in regard to the compulsory powers of this Bill. Your Lordships are aware that, rightly or wrongly, one of the great difficulties in the opinion of the crofting counties is that there is no power in the Crofters Act for the creation of new holdings. It is that which has checked the development of population in these counties. The noble Lord provides compulsory powers, but there are no compulsory powers in this Bill to provide crofters with the tenure of the Crofters Act; and so far as I understand the Bill&#x2014;I hope I am not misunderstanding it&#x2014;the adoption of the Lands Clauses Acts as the machinery for carrying out the compulsory provisions of the Act completely nullifies the benefit which no doubt it is intended to confer. That procedure would be an absolute bar to any such extensions as are contemplated.<lb/>
The demands of the crofting population are very well known. They have asked for new holdings, they have asked for a raising of the limit to &#x00A3;50, they have asked for the extension of the Crofters Act to leaseholders, and they have asked for the extension of the Crofters Act to new areas. All these are to be found, not in the noble Lord's Bill, but in the proposals of the Government. And I hope it is not out of place for me to say that these reforms are not newly proposed by the present Government; many of them were proposed by the Government of the year 1894 and 1895, and it is not likely, in my opinion, after the publicity which has been given, after the official support which has been given, to such proposals, that the crofter community will consider the proposals of the noble Lord sufficient to meet their needs. In regard to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0276"/>
<col>545</col>
leaseholders, I quite believe that the noble Lord is under the impression that leaseholders will be freely admitted to the benefits of the Crofters Act. Will he allow me just to make this observation on that point? His first clause enacts that all those at present in the crofting area and having a holding the annual rent of which does not, and did not, at the passing of the Act of 1886, exceed &#x00A3;30, are to receive the benefits of the Crofters Act. Observe how this boon is limited. In the first place, the benefits of the Crofters Act are only extended to persons who or whose predecessors in the same family have continuously resided on the holdings as tenants since the passing of the Act of 1886. Secondly, only such crofter is admitted who or whose predecessor in the same family shall have at his own cost erected, constructed, or made the buildings and permanent improvements, without receiving compensation from the landlord. Again, every crofter to be admitted must apply to be registered under the Act, and a further exclusion is made to the effect that no person will be entitled to the benefits of the Act who or whose predecessor was before 1886 but has since then ceased to be a statutory crofter under the Act of 1886. I can assure the noble Lord that his exclusions go very far indeed to reduce the benefits which his clause if it were less limited would confer on those concerned. Therefore, I am obliged, with regret, to take objection on these grounds to the noble Lord's Bill.<lb/>
The Bill does not admit any substantial number of leaseholders, and it increases the rates of existing crofters in two directions. Nowhere are compulsory powers given for the establishment of new holdings with the tenure of the Crofters Act, and I do not believe that crofters side by side with statutory crofters will accept any tenure less favourable than that. The Bill also destroys the judicial character of the Crofters Commission. I trust your Lordships may not be under the impression that there is any considerable body of support, or any support whatever, in my humble judgment, among the supporters of the Government for any such proposal as this. Those who think that really only deceive themselves. There has been intense disappointment at the rejection by your Lordships' House of the Government's proposals, and the absence of, and the blank negative given to, legislation on this subject must affect different minds in different ways. Some men seek
<col>546</col>
other outlets of hope that reform might be obtained. But it is quite contrary to the fact that there has been any desire to substitute so partial a Bill as this for the proposals of the Government, and I feel quite sure that if the real effect of the provisions of this Bill were known it would be summarily rejected as a solution of the problem which is before us.<lb/>
I do not attempt on this occasion&#x2014;though I would gladly do so&#x2014;to discuss the bearing of what I have ventured to say about the definition of crofter and the absence of distinction, except those I have mentioned, between a crofter and small farmer, and the bearing that has on the question as it affects the whole of Scotland. Setting that branch of the subject altogether aside, I will only say again that I regret profoundly to differ from the noble Lord, but I feel sure that this is a wholly inadequate proposal. It is hopeless to consider it as meeting the problem. It strikes a blow&#x2014;I have no doubt unintentionally&#x2014;which would be profoundly resented throughout Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00953"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord commenced his observations by saying he was grateful to Lord Lovat for having given him this opportunity of dealing with this matter. I hope that my noble friend did not expect very much in the way of gratitude, because exactly the same remark was made to me two or three days ago on a similar Bill, and the conclusion to which the noble Lord finally came was that he was obliged to differ from me totally, as he has been obliged to-day to differ from my noble friend behind me.<lb/>
Having commenced his speech in this manner, the noble Lord went on to give us a long disquisition upon a variety of phases and interests in the crofter question. He spoke without very great respect of the Douglas Commission, for one thing. The noble Lord probably knows that Mr. Douglas was a Member sitting on the same side as himself, and that he and Mr. Munro Ferguson, who is also a friend of the noble Lord, were the moving persons in the Commission. He went on to speak of the Deer Forest Commission, and then got into the generalities of the crofter question. All that part of his speech was rendered quite unnecessary by a remark of Lord Lovat's to the effect that this Bill is founded, not on any part of the crofter
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0277"/>
<col>547</col>
question, but on the Crofters Act, and was intended as an attempt to deal with difficulties under which the crofters consider they labour in the present state of the law.<lb/>
I will not imitate the noble Lord, but will go at once to the Bill. With regard to some of the details of it, I think that probably Lord Lovat himself will be the best person to reply to the points raised. In the first place, the noble Lord said that the Crofters Commission was necessary for the Highlands. Of course it is; nobody questions it. The proposal of the noble Lord is to amalgamate the Congested Districts Board with the Crofters Commission. The other way would have produced the same result. The intention of the Bill is that instead of two Boards, which at the present time confessedly have not sufficient business to occupy them, there should be one Board which should discharge in the Highlands the functions now discharged by both. The noble Lord said that the Crofters Commission is a judicial body. But does not the Crofters Commission fix rents? Does not the Commission say what land is to be taken, and so on? If those are not administrative functions, I do not know what administrative functions are; and at the present time there is no reason, so far as I can see, why the Crofters Commission, especially if enlarged as my noble friend proposes, should not be able to discharge the duties of both.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord fell foul of the single valuer. I was particularly surprised to hear him do that. I must say the differences between the noble Lord and the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture always do excite my admiration. I will tell your Lordships why I think those differences exist. I believe the noble Lord is very jealous of Lord Carrington, and that he has a great desire to set up an agricultural snuggery of his own in Scotland, and for that reason when the Agricultural Holdings Bill was before this House I observed that not one single bit of assistance was given to Lord Carrington from the Scottish Office. I more than once asked Lord Carrington why he had got no information from the Scottish Office, and he was able to give me no answer. The reason clearly was that the Scottish Office was not particularly anxious to give him any assistance. The noble Lord sneered at Lord Carrington for having
<col>548</col>
got into a mess about the valuation of sheep. Yes, he did. I told him at the time that he would get into a mess and he accepted an Amendment from me which would have prevented it; but when the Bill went back to the House of Commons the English Solicitor-General said my Amendment was unnecessary, and for that reason Lord Carrington gave it up, and the Scottish Law Officers in the other House appear never to have taken the matter into their consideration. I do not think it is very wise of my noble friend to bring before us these domestic differences which appear to exist between his Office and the Board of Agriculture. And let me say that I feel quite certain I am expressing the opinion of every Scotsman present when I say that I hope the Board of Agriculture will continue to have authority in Scotland, and that we shall not have any half-equipped Department with the noble Lord as the head of it. What is the objection to the single valuer? The Government are always saying, Let us do what is cheapest; it may possibly be not the best, but it is the cheapest, and cheapness is what you have to look to. From this point of view I do not understand why the single valuer is objected to in this case.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord says the crofting tenure is not given by this Bill. I know that it is the intention of my noble friend to give the crofting tenure, and no doubt if he has not done so, he will do it. Clause 37 of this Bill provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"This Act may be cited as the Crofting Parishes (Scotland) Act 1909 and so far as it relates to crofters holdings shall be construed with the Crofters Acts and may be cited with those Acts as the Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Acts 1880 to 1909."</quote>
I should have thought that that would have meant that those Acts were incorporated; but, if not, I am sure that my noble friend at a later stage of the Bill will take the opportunity of doing so.<lb/>
I have not yet heard any reasons given for objecting to the creation of new holdings. I suppose the noble Lord will not say that Lord Lovat is not making a new and a very great change in the law by proposing to create new crofts. Up to the present time the law has been that you could not make new crofts. The noble Lord by this Bill proposes to give that power. It is really useless to argue with the noble Lord
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0278"/>
<col>549</col>
the Secretary for Scotland, because he never can get one thing out of his mind&#x2014;that a croft is a small holding and a small holding is a croft. We have tried to impart to him at all events that amount of agricultural information, and it seems to me quite useless to say it over again. Does the noble Lord mean to tell me that he and those Members who represent the crofting districts are agreed about this matter? He may possibly remember that eighteen crofter Members in May of last year presented a memorial to the Prime Minister protesting against the noble Lord&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00954"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is entirely mistaken in his reading of these events. No Government could possibly have had a more loyal body of supporters than the Government had for, I think, a period of more than two sessions, and there is not one of those Members to whom the noble Earl alludes who would not far greater prefer the Government Bill to any other Bill, or to any portion of any other Bill, that has yet been proposed for dealing with this matter. If it were possible to save any portion of our proposals on right lines an offer should have been made; but your Lordships made it clear to us that that was impossible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00955"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is the first Minister I ever knew who seemed to take a pleasure in having a memorial presented advising a course different from that which he was proposing. It is quite true that they say they agree with the Government Bill, but they add that the Government Bill is impossible. Let me read an extract from the memorial&#x2014;
<quote>"The rejection by the House of Lords of the Government Bill has convinced us that until grave constitutional issues have been decided land legislation cannot be secured upon these lines. While there is general agreement as to the end to be attained, there is profound divergence of opinion as to method. Conservative Peers, though rejecting the Government Bill, have introduced measures, inadequate, indeed, but admitting the necessity for action, and admitting willingness to go some way to meet us. The moment, then, is opportune for a serious attempt to find common ground and by judicial compromise to pass a really satisfactory measure."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00956"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl has any proposals for a compromise or wishes to give, any indication how far he is willing to go to meet the Government, I can say for the Government that we shall be perfectly willing to consider those proposals.</membercontribution></p>
<col>550</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00957"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: We are not now considering a compromise but Lord Lovat's Bill, and what I was reading to your Lordships was a statement made by the crofter Members who the noble Lord considers are in agreement with him. Finally, they advised that there should be a compromise. They said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Government should, at any rate, consent to a conference consisting of Members of both Parties in both Houses."</quote>
I presume that that was put before the noble Lord, and that, as usual, he was obdurate, and declined to make the slightest change in his proposals. I am quite convinced of this, that if we had only the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to deal with we should very soon come to an arrangement; but, judging from my previous experience of the Secretary for Scotland, I do not think it is likely that any compromise will be arrived at with him. This House is very desirous of settling this question, and by the Bill which was called my Bill and by this Bill we have put forward very serious proposals going a long way in the direction of the Government.<lb/>
The noble Lord is always having correspondence with someone, and the last letter he seems to have written appears to have been to Mr. Weir. In an endeavour to smooth Mr. Weir down, the Secretary for Scotland wrote a letter to the hon. Member in which, after mentioning the Government Bill, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The House of Lords rejected this measure, and the Opposition in that House have further plainly indicated that they will not sanction any extension of the Crofters Holdings Act which will satisfy the needs of the country."</quote>
Now, my Lords, is that a fair statement? Your Lordships heard what the Lord Chancellor said of my Bill the other day. The noble Lord's Bill to-night, for the first time, creates new holdings and makes it possible to create new crofts, and he says he is perfectly prepared to give crofter tenure if it is not already given in the Bill. The noble Lord, in his letter to Mr. Weir, proceeded to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Government mean to persist in their endeavour to obtain small holdings legislation for Scotland."</quote>
Well, how do they propose to persist? The noble Lord, when taking leave of his constituents, wrote them a very affecting letter, in which he stated the grief it gave him to leave the House of Commons,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0279"/>
<col>551</col>
and he added that the only thing which could have induced him to do so was to further administrative legislation in this House. Well, we have been waiting all these months. Last year I brought in a Bill, and I was attacked for not waiting for the Government. This year I waited for the Government until I was tired of waiting and was driven at last to bring in my Bill. I wish the noble Lord would bring in the Government Bill. If he would do so, I can promise him that we would endeavour to extract a great deal of information about its origin. But do not let him write in letters that this House has declared that it will do nothing. It has done nothing of the kind.<lb/>
I have observed that when the noble Lord is in a difficulty he endeavours to put it off on to somebody else. All the trouble in Vatersay was occasioned by Lady Cathcart, you know. And now that he cannot provide legislation to satisfy his crofter friends, that is the fault of the House of Lords. In his letter to his late constituents the noble Lord asked for a continuance of the staunch support he had hitherto received&#x2014;
<quote>"in order that the forces of Liberalism and progress may overcome obstacles presented to reform in this and other directions by the predominance of the Opposition in the House of Lords."</quote>
That is all very well on the platform, but it does not produce any effect in this House, and I do not think it has produced any effect on Mr. Weir judging from the reply he has made; nor do I think it has produced much effect on any of the crofter Members. I am glad to hear that the noble Lord is on such excellent terms with them. I hope it may long continue.<lb/>
The great difference between this Bill and the Government Bill is this, that this Bill says that when land is required it may be hired compulsorily, but it must be hired by the Commission, and, therefore, the Commission will intervene between the crofter and the unwilling owner. Of course, where the owner is willing the arrangement will be made privately. But the plan of the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland is this, that the central body &#x2014;in his case a land Court&#x2014;is to fix the rent for an unwilling individual who believes the scheme is wrong and not likely to succeed, and then the noble Lord pursues the general practice of leaving that individual
<col>552</col>
to look after himself. That is the radical difference between these two proposals, and I cannot help thinking that the proposal which my noble friend Lord Lovat has put in, and which has succeeded so well in England, is the right course for us to take in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00958"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Secretary for Scotland has treated the House this evening to a somewhat remarkable and unusual performance. He rose to reply to my noble friend Lord Lovat, who had moved the Second Reading of his Bill in a speech of moderate length and full of appropriate arguments; but the noble Lord opposite, before he began to address himself to the case made by Lord Lovat, spoke for something like three-quarters of an hour by the clock, not in reply to Lord Lovat, but in reply to a speech I had made in this House twelve months ago. I am almost inclined to demand reciprocity of treatment, and to say that if the noble Lord will allow me an interval of twelve months, I shall be perfectly ready to deal with his arguments. But I am going to try and say a word in reply on the spur of the moment.<lb/>
The noble Lord took great exception to certain observations I had made as to the condition of the Scottish crofters. I am not convinced by what the noble Lord has said that my description was an inaccurate one, although it is quite possible that it does not apply to all crofters. I quoted the observations of the Douglas Commission. The noble Lord said that the Douglas Commission only spent a fortnight in its voyage of discovery, but I think in a fortnight you can manage to see a good deal of the condition of the people through whose districts you are travelling. Why, in Ireland we are used to having farms valued by gentlemen who spend a couple of hours upon the land and are then prepared to fix the rent which it is to pay during the next fifteen years with mathematical precision.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord stated that the condition of affairs in Barra was not typical of the whole of the crofting areas. Very likely not; but we have heard a great many details in this House as to the kind of agriculture to be found in those areas, and the kind of conduct to which, no doubt under the pressure of dire necessity, the dwellers in those areas occasionally
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0280"/>
<col>553</col>
resort. But I am inclined to oppose to the roseate description of the Secretary for Scotland a description given of the crofting areas by another and not less distinguished Scotsman. When in 1907 we were debating the Scottish Small Holdings Bill my noble friend Lord Rosebery, a Scotsman whom all Scotsmen will claim as a very distinguished and competent representative of that country, gave to your Lordships a sketch of the crofting system as he was aware of it. May I read an extract from his speech? Lord Rosebery said&#x2014;
<quote>"What is the crofting system? Is it the survival of the fittest? Is it the highest form of agriculture known to Scotland that we are asked to adopt? Some of your Lordships travelling in the Highlands may have seen thin, sparsely cultivated strips of land, sometimes with a cottage built by the savings of children abroad, by lonely lakes, or by the shores of the sea, or on barren moors. There live men who would rather die than leave their native land, struggling against nature, and trying to secure a precarious crop in a climate totally unsuitable for it, on soil wholly unadapted for it. Rather than leave or migrate they persevere in cultivating that ungrateful soil. All honour to them for it; I respect them for it. But I do not think that is a condition of things that we ought to work and legislate to transfer to the magnificent and fertile fields of the Lothians and the Lowlands of Scotland. I cannot imagine any responsible Minister who knows what a crofter is and what a croft is coining down deliberately to this House and proposing to apply that system to the Lowlands of Scotland. I should have been less surprised had the Secretary for War, in producing his Bill for the Territorial Forces, decided that his new Army should be provided with bows and arrows for defensive purposes. What you are attempting to do by introducing the crofting system is to supersede the highest farming known to great Britain, and perhaps to the world, by the most backward system in these Islands."</quote>
That is a pretty strong piece of Scottish testimony as to the results of the crofting system.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord took great exception to my attempting to establish a distinction between a croft and a farm and a crofter and a small tenant. The noble Lord told us that all crofters were not hereditary crofters. Very likely not. But I still maintain, and I shall continue to maintain, that the origin of the crofter system is hereditary and customary as distinguished from contractual tenure. No doubt other small occupiers have been admitted to crofts who were not hereditary crofters, but that was because they were found in the crofting areas where it was the custom of the country, and very naturally their tenure was made to assimilate to the tenure of those who lived in that neighbourhood.
<col>554</col>
The noble Lord was, I think, possessed with an idea that I had some desire to undermine and demolish the crofting system where it already exists. I do not think I have ever said anything suggestive of that idea. What I have said is that although I am entirely in favour of recognising the crofting system where you have it already, and of making the position of these poor people as tolerable as you can make it, I am entirely opposed to attempts to extend that system to other parts of Scotland in supersession of the system to which we are accustomed, and under which Scottish agriculture has so greatly prospered. The noble Lord told us that the system which he contemplated was not the same as the Irish system. It is true there is a difference. I think the system which finds favour with the noble Lord does not admit free sale. The other two F's do find a place in the plan.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00959"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I was contrasting the existing crofting system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00960"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I object altogether to give the three F's, or any of the F's, in parts of the country where they do not exist already. That is my point; and I say that for this reason, that I believe that agriculture in the United Kingdom has upon the whole succeeded as well as it has, and that agriculturists have been able to overcome the immense difficulties with which they had to contend during the period we refer to as the bad times, because we had a system under which landlord and tenant were able to combine their forces and show a firm front against the trials which both then had to undergo. What is it we want in order that agriculture in these islands shall be successful? We want the application of capital to the land, and under the present system as we know it in Great Britain the landlord has every inducement to put his captial into the land. It is very often computed that of the joint capital contributed by owner and occupier something like four-fifths is contributed by the owner. If you introduce fixity of tenure and fair rents fixed by a Court, do you believe for a moment that landlords will go on pouring capital into the land? Of course they will not. Then, who, is going to find the capital? Does the noble Lord think that these miserably small tenants are in a position to find large sums of capital to put into their holdings? Of course they are not. You are in this dilemma&#x2014;either the capital will not be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0281"/>
<col>555</col>
forthcoming at all, or&#x2014;and this is what I expect is at the back of these proposals&#x2014;you will have to extract it out of the pockets of the taxpayers or the ratepayers of this country. Therefore, I say again, by all means let us deal as tenderly as possible with these crofters wherever they exist; let us, if you like, enlarge their holdings; let us create new crofts if they are necessary within the crofting areas; but do not let us &#x2014;it seems tome it would be madness to do it &#x2014;gratuitously substitute that system for the system which we know in those parts of Scotland which are outside the limits of the crofting areas.<lb/>
The Bill of my noble friend, Lord Lovat, is the complement of the Bill proposed by my noble friend, Lord Camperdown. Lord Camperdown deals with holdings outside the crofting areas, and my noble friend, Lord Lovat, like my noble friend Lord Camperdown, recognises that distinction which, to the end of my days, I shall believe does exist between the man who is a crofter and the man who is not a crofter. Lord Lovat's proposals seem to me, so far as I am able to follow them, to be conceived in a very liberal spirit. So far from undermining the position of the Crofters Commission, he preserves its powers and adds to its numbers. I am quite prepared to vote for his Bill, although I do not pretend to a knowledge of its minute details. But when the noble Lord twits us with trying to stand upon two legs, and not knowing upon which leg to stand, I say we shall stand firmly on the two legs and be well supported by them. I believe, on the other hand, that the noble Lord, with his one-legged proposal, is in a rickety position, and I therefore prefer the two-legged proposal of my noble friends to the one-legged proposal of the noble Lord opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00961"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have on several occasions taken part in debates on this subject, and when the Government's Bill was thrown out by your Lordships I anticipated that it would reappear over and over again in other forms, and the present Bill and that of Lord Camperdown are the fulfilment of that anticipation. I anticipated that because your Lordships, I am certain, are aware that there is a real necessity for some system by which small holdings or crofts, or whatever you please to call them, shall be increased in
<col>556</col>
number. I believe every Scotsman would say that. We all deplore the increase of emigration and the depletion of the country districts at the present time. Scotland is suffering from the want of the equivalent of that which this House and the other House have already in this Parliament done for England.<lb/>
The two subjects dealt with in the crofting Bill of Lord Lovat and in the other Bill relating to the Lowlands which has been introduced by Lord Camperdown are inextricably mixed up one with the other. They cannot be separated, and you cannot separate them in debate. Witness, for example, the speech we have just heard from the noble Marquess. It was completely relevant, but it did largely deal with the Lowland aspect of the question. May I say a word or two in reference to that? As to the crofter part of this Bill, my noble friend Lord Pentland has already dealt with that, and has pointed out the difficulties the Government entertain on the subject; but as to the other side, we have had quoted again the speech of Lord Rosebery, which was the commencement of the opposition with regard to this policy. We are told that what we mean to do is to extend the crofter system to the Lowlands. What do we mean by the crofting system? Do we mean that we want to extend to the Lowlands the lonely shores and the barren moors? Of course not.<lb/>
What they want in the Lowlands&#x2014;I do not care what you call it&#x2014;is fixity of tenure, and what they want also is fair rent. I was rather surprised to hear the noble Marquess object to fixity of tenure and fair rent, since those two principles are embodied in Lord Camperdown's Bill applying to the Lowlands, which was heartily supported by the noble Marquess. I do not know whether he has realised that the noble Earl has brought in, and that your Lordships have, on the invitation of Lord Camperdown, twice carried the Second Reading of, a Bill containing fixity of tenure and fair rent to be established by a single valuer in the Lowlands of Scotland. If the noble Marquess really thinks that the result of such a thing as that is to prevent landlords putting their money into land, then I am afraid he has unconsciously been an aider and abettor in a disastrous step.<lb/>
What is the difference between us in regard to the Lowland aspect of the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0282"/>
<col>557</col>
question? Really and truly if your Lordships will give the matter your impartial consideration you will see that the difference lies in a nutshell. It is this. According to the English Bill the rates and taxes are to be drawn upon, the rates primarily, whereas according to the Scottish Bill the rates were not to be called upon at all. There is a general if not a universal feeling in Scotland that that part of our revenues which consists of grants from the Exchequer should be applied to this purpose. The employment or non-employment of the county council one way or the other follows as a corollary when once you have determined that fact. That is the whole difference between us. The Scottish people do not want the rates to be involved, and therefore they say, "Give us part on our taxes." The county councils, therefore, do not come in. Why should they? Your Lordships will excuse me, I know, for speaking quite plainly and frankly. If a proposal had been brought in for Scotland by a Conservative Government dealing with the Lowlands, and the amount of difference between us was what I have indicated, would your Lordships have thrown out the Bill? I feel it is a great pity it was done.<lb/>
An appeal was made to me by my noble friend Lord Camperdown, and I must disclaim virtues which I do not possess. I certainly disclaim the comparison he made, which would be overjust to me and unjust to my noble friend. But let me say that I am not the person to appeal to in these circumstances. The noble Marquess himself has Scottish blood, to which we, of course, attribute his success and his great talents. Would he think me impertinent if I appealed from Lord Lansdowne to Lord Nairne, the last of his dignities, and asked him to consider whether there ought not to be a real effort on his part&#x2014;on the part of the noble Marquess, who will not deny that he is responsible for having thrown out the Government's Bill&#x2014;to deal with this question, because although rapier thrusts in debate are very entertaining, is there not something rather sad in the fact that in Scotland no progress has been made?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00962"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should certainly not have intervened in this debate had it not been for one or two remarks made by the noble and learned Lord who has just spoken. It does seem to me that the cardinal objections we
<col>558</col>
have always held to the Government's proposals, as we know them, have not yet been driven home to his mind. What we have always objected to was the extension of the crofter tenure outside the crofter districts. It was clearly understood in 1886, when crofter legislation was first initiated, that it was on account of the hereditary nature of that tenure.<lb/>
The Report of Lord Napier's Commission was distinctly confined to recommending certain legislation for crofters who were hereditary crofters. Unfortunately, the Government of that day, instead of taking that as the distinction whether a man was a crofter or not a crofter, took a financial limit&#x2014;&#x00A3;30 of rent&#x2014;and if a man in certain crofting counties was a holder under &#x00A3;30 he was treated as a crofter, and from time to time there has been agitation to get that extension put beyond the crofting areas. The border line is difficult to draw. I will take the county of Forfarshire. The noble Lord will find that in the hill districts there are those who are absolutely indistinguishable from the crofters in the Highlands. But even in the same parishes there are people who are small holders, and it is the cardinal point with us on this side of the House that the crofter tenure as such shall not be extended to those who are not crofters in the strict sense of the term.<lb/>
I only wish there was a chance of accepting the suggestion made by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack just now, to enter into discussion as to whether we cannot invent a system of small holdings with fixity of tenure and fair rents. None of us have ever objected to that, but what we have objected to is that, as distinguished from the English system, there is no buffer between the landlord and the small holder to make sure that if the man, not selected by the landlord, should fail, the loss of that failure should not fall on the landlord. I do not think it is fair that the landlord's capital should be risked by the failure of a tenant whom he has not had the responsibility of choosing. So far as I am concerned, if you give us anything like the English terms, whether you do it by means of the county council or a body responsible to the Treasury, we shall be satisfied. If you are going to take compulsorily from the landlord land which is not now under crofter tenure, you are bound to give him that amount of security which is given under the English Act.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0283"/>
<col>559</col>
It is idle to attempt to blur the difference between what is strictly crofting tenure and what is small holding tenure. The vice of the original proposals which were put before Parliament was this, that that distinction was not sufficiently borne in mind. That has been the root of all the evil. I do not wish to discuss the matter further, because, after all, it is more germane to Lord Camperdown's Bill than to the Bill now before the House; but if we could get rid of the idea that it is reasonable to extend crofting tenure outside the crofting area, we should have made a great advance towards the settlement of this question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00963"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say one or two words in reply. I think the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland attacked details rather than any question of principle in the Bill. The points he raised were eminently Committee points rather than Second Reading points, and I fail to see, from anything he said, where the great divergence between us arises. He referred, first of all, to what he described as the disadvantage of turning the Crofter Commission and the Congested Districts Board into one body. The judicial work of the Crofters Commission has practically ceased. There may be a slight revival under the new chairman, but during the past ten years there have been no great number of applications. In some years the actual reductions of rent amounted to &#x00A3;20 or &#x00A3;30 over the whole of Scotland. I believe I am correct in stating that in one year, about three or four years ago, with the exception of the cases of a Radical Peer and an American millionaire, the reductions on revalued rents were under a &#x00A3;10 note. Therefore, if the judicial work of the Crofters Commission has been very much reduced and they are now doing executive work, why not amalgamate the two boards? The crofter Members in their Bill bring in this very suggestion. As to the objection to the single valuer, I think the noble Lord based that on the idea that sheep valuation was always done by a single valuer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00964"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I alluded to sheep valuation as an instance where there was no statutory valuation afforded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00965"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: But in the case of sheep valuation there is always an arbitrator appointed by both sides, and they appoint an oversman. The question of the rating
<col>560</col>
of crofter houses that are used for letting purposes in the summer is one which I do not consider of any great importance. Then one of the noble Lord's objections was that we retained the limitation of &#x00A3;30 instead of &#x00A3;50, as in his Bill. That is really a trifling matter. If you look at the Board of Agriculture returns, you will find that in the crofting parishes there are a very small number of holdings indeed between &#x00A3;30 and &#x00A3;50. Is it contended that any sensible Scotsman would wish to come under the Crofters Act in order to get a few pounds reduction in his rent when he would lose the right to have his improvements done for him? Crofters do their own improvements, but the &#x00A3;30 to &#x00A3;50 holder in Scotland, as a rule, has his improvements done for him. Therefore, there is not much in this point.<lb/>
The noble Lord went on to say that there is in the crofting parishes a unanimous wish that the area should be extended. All I can say is that I have no personal knowledge of it. What the crofters want is legislation for themselves. Then on the question of leases. The clauses to which the noble Lord objected were put forward by the landed interest, and they were put forward because certain crofters voluntarily contracted out of the Crofters Act in order to get the whole of their buildings done for them. I hold that it was unfair that men who contracted out of the Act should be allowed to go back, and it was for that reason that this lease clause was framed. Then there was the attempt to charge this side of the House with definite opposition to the Crofters Act. I protest against that. This Bill is based entirely on the Crofters Act. My object is to make it an extension of the Crofters Act, and not to undermine that Act. The noble Lord said that under my Bill these persons would not hold under the Crofters Act. I think Clause 37, which was read by my noble friend Lord Camperdown, will cover that point. The noble Lord insists on his contention that there is a great desire on the part of crofters to remain under the Act. Now, what the crofter wants is fixity of tenure. He does not care anything about the Act. The majority of applications now are not to hold under the fixed rent of the Crofters Commission. They would sooner hold direct from the landlord, because they know that they have then a much better chance of having their buildings and improvements made for them. If it is desired that this should be brought out more fully
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0284"/>
<col>561</col>
I shall be glad to have that point, with adequate safeguards, introduced into the Bill.<lb/>
In conclusion, I honestly believe there is a great demand for this legislation in the Highlands. I believe that the situation there is in many respects more serious than is generally supposed. The people who remain on the crofts are not the young men. The young men are emigrating to America and Australia at a quicker pace than has been the case during the last twenty years. I believe this is owing to the fact that there is not a living on the crofts already in existence, and I am of opinion that further development should be made, not so much in the creation of new holdings, but in the creation of economic holdings, at the same time taking advantage of legislation on the subject of a grant for the development of forestal work and the development of co-operation. I would gladly welcome the assistance of the Lord Chancellor, in coming to an agreement for legislative action on the lines indicated.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00968" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00969">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00970"><member>THE EARL OF CHICHESTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the object of this Bill is to regulate and organise the profession of accountant by setting up a register and by ordering that persons who are not on the register should not offer themselves as, or take any name or title which may appear to imply that they are, professional accountants, and should not hold themselves out to the public as ready to undertake for pay the business of a professional accountant. The machinery set up by the Bill is a Registration Committee consisting of fifteen members, nine of whom would be appointed by the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and
<col>562</col>
six by the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors. The registrar of the committee would be the secretary of the Institute for the time being. Power is asked for under the Bill for the committee to make rules and regulations in regard to registration, for the holding of examinations, and generally for the execution of the business of the Bill. This body would possess disciplinary powers, but these powers are limited by Clause 13, under which, in cases where a name is struck off the register or where there is a refusal to register, an appeal to the High Court is allowed.<lb/>
Before going further into the Bill I should like to say a few words about the position of the profession, and the duties which professional accountants may be called upon at any moment to perform. At the head of this profession there are the two great societies I have named. The Institute of Chartered Accountants was given its Charter in 1880, and it has no fewer than 4,000 members. Between seventy and eighty per cent. of those members have not only passed three examinations in order to become members but have also served under articles, the small percentage that remains having become members of the Institute on incorporation. The Society of Public Accountants and Auditors was incorporated five years later&#x2014;namely, in 1885&#x2014;and the Board of Trade then granted them a licence to omit the word "Limited" after their name. They have now a membership of well over 2,000, and also in their case there is a very stringent set of three examinations; and not only are articled clerks of five years service allowed to enter for their examinations, but also ordinary paid clerks, thereby allowing a class of men to enter the profession who might not be able to afford the considerable expense of articles.<lb/>
These two institutions not only examine candidates before admitting them, but also exercise discipline over their members. But at present this discipline is almost entirely discounted by the fact that anyone may offer himself to the public as a public accountant. A man who is dismissed from one of these great societies through unprofessional or dishonourable conduct may to-morrow offer himself as a public accountant. In addition to the societies to which I have referred and those accountants of a free-lance character, a series of other societies has sprung up in recent years. The great difference
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0285"/>
<col>563</col>
between these young societies and the two great institutions of which I have spoken is this, that whereas these great institutions are courted by people who wish to become members, the newer societies, on the other hand, have to use considerable ingenuity and enterprise in obtaining members. This, of course, must lead one to wonder whether the qualifications that members of these companies are supposed to have are not, in fact, waived, and I am sorry to say that I have come to the conclusion that in a great many cases they are undoubtedly waived, with the probable exception of the entrance fee.<lb/>
There is, therefore, very little guarantee to the public that the members of these societies are qualified accountants in any sense of the term. On the other hand, though we say these things about them as a body, the members would, of course, if they were able to prove that they possessed a proper qualification as accountants at the time of the passing of this Bill, be eligible for registration. That is provided for in Clause 4. A professional accountant may, under the Companies Act, be appointed liquidator of a public company. He may also be appointed a trustee in bankruptcy; but by far the commonest, though not the least important, of his duties is the auditing of public accounts. All of these duties require not only men of great professional knowledge, but also men who have seen practical work done by having been clerks or articled clerks in accountants' offices. Moreover, it is necessary that these duties should be done by men of great integrity and force of character, for what can be more responsible than the work of auditing the accounts of a public company? The auditor is appointed by the shareholders, to whom he is directly responsible, and he may very often, in the best managed concerns, come into conflict with the management of the company.<lb/>
Under the Companies Consolidation Act of 1908 the duties and responsibilities of auditors have been very much increased. They not only now have to show in their report that the books of the company agree with the balance sheet presented, but they have to state whether or not they have obtained all the information and explanations they have required, and it is expressly stated that every auditor of a company shall have a right of access at all times to
<col>564</col>
the books of the company and shall be entitled to require from the directors and officers such information as may be necessary for the performance of his duties. There is no doubt that these extra responsibilities have been responded to by the profession, and no one can have been in the City ten years, as I have been, without knowing something of the esteem in which the profession is held by all in the City, and the weight which the public attach to their services. I think it can hardly be doubted that they have earned the right to set their house in order.<lb/>
Clause 4 of the Bill enumerates the persons entitled to be registered under this Bill. They are&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. All persons who are now members of the Institute or Society or who from time to time shall become members either of the Institute or of the Society and shall give notice in writing to the Professional Accountants' Register Committee by this Act constituted (hereinafter called the committee') of their intention to practise in England or Wales:</li>
<li>2. Any person who (although not a member of the Institute or of the Society) shall within six months from the passing of this Act give notice in writing to the committee and within twelve months from the passing of this Act prove to the satisfaction of the committee that he was in practice as a professional accountant in England or Wales at the passing of this Act subject nevertheless to the provisions of the section of this Act whereof the marginal note is 'Power to refuse registration in certain cases':</li>
<li>3. Any person who is now or shall hereafter become a member of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh or of the Institute of Accountants and Actuaries in Glasgow or of the Society of Accountants in Aberdeen or of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland and who shall give notice in writing to the committee of his intention to practise as a professional accountant in England or Wales:</li>
<li>4. Any person who is now or shall hereafter become a member of any institute or society of professional accountants incorporated or duly constituted under the laws of any British colony or dependency (including India) or of any territory administered under royal charter or under the laws of the United States of America membership of which is considered from time to time by the committee in their absolute discretion having regard to all the circumstances to be a proper qualification and who shall give notice in writing to the committee of his intention to practise as a professional accountant in England or Wales.</li></ol>
Clause 5 entitles to registration any person not being entitled under Clause 4 who can satisfy the committee that he has passed an examination and has served under articles to a professional accountant practising in England or Wales, such accountant being either registered or
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0286"/>
<col>565</col>
entitled to be registered under the Bill. Provision is made in Clause 17 for the admission of women to membership, and consequently women will be given equal rights with men under the Bill. It does not appear that the profession of accountancy would be particularly attractive to members of the opposite sex, but there are female accountants who are now doing this work, and it has been represented to us that it would be a pity to close the door to any channel which might give occupation to them in future.<lb/>
This question of registration is no new one. As is stated in the Memorandum prefixed to the Bill, several other learned professions have found it necessary, for the discipline and regulation of those professions, to organise and register. But a much nearer analogy is to be drawn from what has been done of late years in the Colonies. For instance, in the Transvaal in 1904 an Ordinance to provide for registration of accountants was assented to by Lord Milner. I believe that last year the Premier of New Zealand piloted through the Legislature a Bill of much the same character, and I understand that at the present time there is in Natal a Bill before the Legislature to provide for the registration of public accountants. Indeed, I think on all hands the principle of registration is admitted. I have not heard a single argument against it. But it would be foolish to conceal the fact that objections have been raised in detail, and if your Lordships will allow me I should like to refer to some of them, though I submit that none of them are Second Reading objections.<lb/>
In the first place, it is pointed out that under Clause 4, subsection (2)&#x2014;which I have read&#x2014;a number of people would be admitted to registration whose qualifications as public accountants might be somewhat doubtful. I have nothing to say to that. That is absolutely true, but it is impossible to make a reform without paying for it, and that is the price we have to pay for the reform proposed in the Bill; and, after all, the objection is a passing one and will disappear in time. Then we have two objections from the great Scottish and Irish societies. I am not quite clear upon this, but I believe the Irish society signified that they were satisfied with what was said in reply to their objections. I am afraid, however,
<col>566</col>
that that is not so in the case of the Scottish societies. It is rather unfortunate for this Bill that it should come up on a day when Scotland seems to be up in arms. These, I think, are the three objections they make most of. First, they say, We agree with registration, but why not include the whole of the United Kingdom? Our answer is that we believe it to be unworkable. We feel that there would be great inconvenience in getting members together from, say, Aberdeen, Dublin, and Edinburgh, and there is also the fact that the law of the three countries varies so greatly, and that makes another difficulty. But if in Committee it is urged that a Part II and a Part III should be added to the Bill, setting up a register for Scotland and one for Ireland, we should only be too glad to agree. We wish to meet these societies in every possible way.<lb/>
Another objection is that under the Bill Scottish accountants would not be able to hold audits in London of branch banks, and so on, without registration. Nothing is further from the intention of the promoters of this Bill, and we say there is nothing in the Bill which makes that view possible, but if any form of words would make it clearer, we should be only too glad to accept them. I admit that the clause is very badly drafted, and I believe a new clause has already been drawn up which, I hope, will put the matter right. Then, of course, there will be opposition from the limited companies to which I have referred. In the public interest we cannot admit that those small limited companies which have been registered in the last four years and give no guarantee to the public of any <i>status</i> whatever should be represented; but, as I have said, if any of their members prove qualification they will be eligible for registration.<lb/>
In conclusion I ask your Lordships to believe, as I sincerely believe, that this Bill has not been put before you with any desire to set up a selfish monopoly. The only motive which has actuated the promoters is a desire to elevate the profession and the standard of professional skill and integrity. To do that would be in the public interest, and it is for that reason that we hope your Lordships will be good enough to give a Second Reading to this Bill and send it to a Joint Committee of both Houses before whom the whole matter can be thrashed out.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-00971">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Chichester</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00972"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member>, who had given notice, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move that the Bill be read a second time this day six months, said: My Lords, I will not follow the noble Lord who has moved the Second Reading by making a long statement, but will try and put my objections to the Bill as shortly as I can. The noble Earl has truly described to your Lordships the two English associations, but we have three bodies in Scotland who all act under Royal Charters dating back to the middle of the last century. Their Charters are world-wide, and the members go to any part of the United Kingdom where their profession may call them and undertake public auditing. Your Lordships will understand that it is a great convenience to those of their clients, such as banks and insurance companies, having branches in different parts of the United Kingdom, that they should be able to audit the books at the several branches. That is their right under their present Charters, and that is what we wish to see continued.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00973">Scottish accountants object to the reduction of their powers implied in the provision of the Bill which entitles them to registration only if they give notice of their intention to practise in England or Wales. There is no definition of the word "practice," and that is an important omission. That, however, is a question for Committee. Our main objection to this Bill is that it decreases the powers we now possess under our Charters and makes England and Wales practically a close corporation for Scottish accountants, who will not be able to follow up their business except under very arduous conditions which we do not think it is fair to put upon them. The City of London is not merely the Capital of England, it is the Capital of the United Kingdom, and the centre to which all business gravitates, and Scottish accountants should be able as at present to do audit work here. Scottish accountants may be required to attend private Committees in your Lordships' House or attend to business at the Scottish Office or the Local Government Board, but they would be debarred unless they submitted to these onerous conditions. Then under the rules of the committee appointed by these English societies there
<col>568</col>
would be a power to reject or refuse to register them at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00974">Further, we would be prevented under this Bill, if we did come to London, from using the letters which we consider are letters of distinction in our profession. Whether we register in England or not we should be debarred from using those letters unless they were first approved of by this committee. These are really very serious objections. We take exception to the penal clauses as being harsh and unfair. The noble Earl who moved the Second Reading suggested that in Committee clauses might be moved on behalf of Scotland, but I would remind the House that the title of the Bill is&#x2014;
<quote>"An Act to provide for the Registration of Professional Accountants in England and Wales; and for other relative purposes."</quote>
The title of the Bill would have to be changed and the Bill itself entirely redrafted if the societies in Scotland and Ireland were to be included. In these circumstances I suggest that the Bill ought to be either withdrawn or rejected, and a new Bill introduced to apply to the United Kingdom. If it is desired to have three registers there is no objection; but if it is necessary to have the Bill at all it should be one Bill for the United Kingdom, giving the bodies of chartered accountants in each of the three countries the powers they have now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00975">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out the word 'now,' and to add at the end of the Motion the words 'this day six months.'"&#x2014;<i>Lord Saltoun</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00976"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who moved the Second Reading of this Bill obviously felt that the measure presented substantial difficulties, and he has placed a Motion on the Paper that in the event of the Bill being read a second time it should be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. I think that a wise course. It is manifest that a Bill dealing with such wide interests has not the slightest chance of passing into law this session. It is also obvious that a Bill dealing with a great profession could not be satisfactory which ignored the case of Scotland and Ireland, and in my opinion the Bill should be redrafted so as to include all members of this profession practising in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0288"/>
<col>569</col>
In Ireland we have a very powerful body of accountants, composed of gentlemen of the highest capacity, acting under a Royal Charter. In Scotland, as Lord Saltoun has said, there are three well-known societies, and it is clear that a Bill dealing with this great profession must include the case of Ireland and Scotland. There are other claims also to be considered. I am not prepared to say offhand that persons who are not chartered accountants, but who are able to do valuable accountancy work, and are, in fact, professional accountants in the more general sense, should be penalised if they are not on the register and fined to the tune of &#x00A3;20 while they are earning their bread fairly and honestly.<lb/>
Moreover, whereas in any other Bill I have ever heard of the body exercising such powers is made amenable to some public authority, here the registration authority is purely self-appointed and can make rules unchecked and unfettered. They may put charges on Scottish and Irish members which would be resented as grossly unfair, and yet there is no appeal to any public authority such as the Board of Trade. It is manifest that the noble Earl in charge of the Bill recognises the difficulties and sees the need of copious redrafting in order to meet the most important of the objections that have been raised. I hope, therefore, that he will be satisfied for this session with the discussion that has taken place and that he will reframe the Bill and introduce it again next session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00977"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, under this Bill at present there is no reciprocity whatever. An English accountant can carry on his profession in Ireland, he can audit the books of an Irish branch of an English business, but a Scotsman or an Irishman cannot do the same in regard to English branches of businesses conducted by their clients, and there are many businesses in Scotland and Ireland which have branches in England. Clause 18 of the Bill provides that a person not registered shall not exercise any function prescribed by law as having to be exercised by a professional accountant. It is not at all that he shall not be a professional accountant, but that he shall not do the business of a professional accountant. That is absolutely intolerable and could not be allowed to pass. The noble Earl the more he studies this will see that he never can bring in a working Bill
<col>570</col>
which will give the necessary reciprocity without dividing it into three Parts, one setting up a register for England, another setting up a register for Scotland, and the other setting up a register for Ireland, and then giving the registered accountant power to pursue his profession in any of the three countries he may choose. That is the only solution. I doubt whether the suggested Parts II and III could be added to a Bill the title of which is, "To provide for the Registration of Professional Accountants in England and Wales." The noble Earl gains nothing by sending a truncated measure like this to a Committee, and it cannot lead to a satisfactory arrangement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00978"><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl in charge of the Bill said that from what he had heard he believed the accountants in Ireland were satisfied. I had a communication from them two days ago and they were by no means satisfied. I do not know, therefore, what ground the noble Earl had for his statement. No communication has reached me or my noble friend on the Front Bench to that effect, and the objections on the part of Ireland are similar to those stated by Lord Saltoun and the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down&#x2014;namely, the absolute want of reciprocity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00979"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl said at the conclusion of his remarks that he did not wish to be selfish. I must say that I do not remember ever having before read such a selfish measure. It means that English accountants are to set up an institution of their own. They are to be empowered to practise in Scotland and Ireland, but Scottish and Irish accountants are not to practise in England. That is pure unadulterated selfishness. The committee set up by the Bill can constitute themselves into a close trust and say to accountants that if they do not join they will suffer all sorts of pains and penalties. I wish to protest most strongly against the Bill, and if my noble friend Lord Saltoun goes to a Division I shall support him in the Lobby.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00980"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: As my noble friend Lord Clonbrock referred to me, I ought to say that I believe the noble Earl who introduced the Bill met the Irish view with great courtesy, and I am informed that the Irish representatives, although very strongly determined that they would get
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0289"/>
<col>571</col>
justice, thought that the idea of a separate Irish register was not an unreasonable one, and they decided to fall in with that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00981"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there has been considerable criticism of the details of my noble friend's Bill, but I do not think that anyone who has spoken has denied that this measure is a very important one and that it deals with a very important matter. That is certainly the opinion of the Department which I represent. The profession of accountancy is becoming yearly of increasing importance with the growth of the system of carrying on business by means of public companies, and it is certainly thought at the Board of Trade that it would probably be to the public advantage that those who carry on the very responsible duties of public accountants should be organised and should be regulated in the same way as the great professions of the law and of medicine are regulated, and with the object of securing that end it is probably desirable that some such machinery should be set up as is provided by this Bill. Up to that point I think I may say that my noble friend has made out a very strong <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case in favour of his Bill. But, of course, in allowing the creation of a close corporation of this kind it is necessary to take the utmost possible pains to prevent injustice being done to any individual or class of persons, and certainly neither I nor my noble friend behind me the Secretary for Scotland would be found consenting to any injustice being done to our fellow-countrymen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00982"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: What about Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00983"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: I am sure Ireland would be looked after, too. The suggestion I have to make on behalf of the Government is that the Bill should be read a second time on the understanding that it is to be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, where full inquiry can be held and where any persons who are aggrieved can have an opportunity of appearing and making their grievances known. On those grounds we should support my noble friend's Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-00984"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not intend, at this important hour of the evening, to detain your Lordships for more than a moment or two, but the noble Lord who has just sat down used
<col>572</col>
words to the effect that no one contested the principle of this Bill. I think the reason why the principle of the Bill was not contested was that the discussion was overlaid by that friendly international jealousy with which we are familiar in debates in both Houses of Parliament. The noble Lord opposite has come in contact with the sentiment with which I am very familiar&#x2014;the great local patriotism of the two sister kingdoms. That has occupied your Lordships' time this evening. I longed to say all the time my noble friends were speaking that that is not the only objection to the Bill. When the Second Reading of a Bill is moved, the first thing to make out, in my judgment, is that there is a grievance or an evil to be remedied for which the measure is necessary. As far as I could make out from the noble Earl's speech, he never touched on that at all, but simply spoke of the provisions of the Bill. He told us there were similar provisions in the legislation of other countries; he told us he would accept Amendments; but he did not tell us there was any grievance to be remedied. Until that is explained to your Lordships I cannot assent to the Second Reading of the Bill. It seems to me that these close corporations are only justifiable if there is great good to be performed or a great evil to be remedied, and those things have to be made out first of all. This is the old medieval system; it is the old guild system coming back again. It is no doubt necessary in the medical profession, but it has to be shown to be necessary in the case of professional accountants; and until it is I must rank myself with my noble friend who moved the rejection of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

But I leave that point. I have only risen to say a word as to the attitude of the Government. The attitude of the Government is of a benevolent description. It is what the Foreign Office would call "cool and correct," and we think that the reference of the Bill to a Joint Committee of both Houses a reasonable proposal. The whole question would have to be postponed for twelve months, and I do respectfully suggest that it is not unreasonable to ask the House to agree to the Second Reading on the understanding that there should be an inquiry into the subject.</membercontribution></p>

We have the greatest respect for the great societies in the sister countries, and wish always to live on reciprocal terms with them. But after all, this is our Bill. We want to regulate ourselves, to set up a register for ourselves, and to organise the profession in London, and it is because we were thinking of this that your Lordships have discovered that it would not be easy to set up a register in this Bill for Ireland and Scotland.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01002"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary for Scotland whether he will state how many fishing vessels under foreign flags were reported to the Scottish Fishery Board in the year 1908 as trawling within the area of sea prohibited by by-laws made under the Herring Fishery Act of 1889, and whether he can state what countries these vessels purported to belong to; whether he will inform the House what are the orders now given by the Scottish Fishery Board to the commanders of their cruisers with reference to the detention or search of trawlers under foreign flags fishing in the areas prohibited under the by-laws of that Department beyond the three-mile limit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01003"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in reply to the noble Lord I have to say that the only area closed by by-law which is frequented by trawlers sailing under a foreign flag is the Moray Firth.

My noble friend will perhaps not expect me to indicate the precise scope of the Fishery Board's confidential instructions; but the ordinary practice is not to search or detain trawlers found fishing under a foreign flag in the prohibited areas outside the three-mile limit.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ALIENS IN THE MERCANTILE MARINE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01035"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>:My Lords, I rise to call attention to the number of aliens serving in British ships, and to the national danger they would present in time of war; to ask whether any precautions have been adopted, and, if so, of what nature, in preventing alien masters or officers of British merchant ships from obtaining confidential information from British naval authorities in war-time; and to move "That in the opinion of this House it is inimical to the interests of the Empire that aliens should be permitted to command or officer British ships."<lb/>
When last I introduced this question the noble Lord who opposed me remarked that it was a very favourite question of mine; he mentioned the number of times I had brought it forward, and added that on no occasion had I been successful. If I may say so, this want of success was due, not, I feel, to any want of sympathy on the part of your Lordships, but to that
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0294"/>
<col>581</col>
stubborn opposition of the Board of Trade with which I am almost invariably faced. I am convinced that there is not one amongst your Lordships who does not, at least, agree with the abstract principle that no alien, especially when certain <i>quasi</i>-magisterial capacities are vested in him, should be allowed to command or officer a British merchant ship.<lb/>
The noble Lord who represents the Board of Trade dwelt on my pertinacity in bringing forward this subject and on the vain efforts I have made. But, speaking in all humility, I would venture to submit that I have not been quite as unsuccessful as he appears to think. In the Bills which I had the honour to submit for your Lordships' consideration there was one important section framed with the object of preventing aliens from obtaining pilotage certificates for British waters. These Bills were rejected, aliens were still privileged in regard to British pilotage certificates, and, similarly, aliens still supplant Britishers in commanding and officering British ships. But the curious feature about it is that only a little later the Government themselves adopted&#x2014;or, shall I say, appropriated? &#x2014;my provision as to alien pilots. An exactly similar section was introduced into the Merchant Shipping Bill of 1906, and the clause limiting the granting of pilotage certificates for British waters to British subjects was carried unanimously. I have not the remotest wish to claim any personal credit for this, but I must at least submit that, in view of what has transpired, the Bill which I introduced was worthy of much more consideration than it then received.<lb/>
Having themselves abolished alien pilots, I am now anxious that the Government should go a little further and deal in an equally decisive way with what is a far greater national evil. We may forbid aliens obtaining British pilotage certificates but we cannot, in the slightest degree, prevent them from making themselves familiar with everything concerning the shoals and shallows of our coasts and the lights and various navigational safeguards. But where it is a case of an alien commanding or officering a British merchant ship, then I do most earnestly contend that he is a menace to the interests of the Empire and a grave danger to the State.<lb/>
It is hardly necessary for me to point out to your Lordships that it is on our
<col>582</col>
merchant service that this country primarily depends. For what reason I am totally unable to fathom, agriculture is very frequently described as our premier industry, but the products of the agriculture in this country would not suffice to keep us alive for two months. It is upon our merchant service and upon the food and other supplies which it brings into this country with such unfailing efficiency and regularity that we are absolutely dependent. Cut these supplies off &#x2014;and it is not a process of such very great difficulty&#x2014;and we would be starved into submission in no time. Your Lordships will probably agree with me that it is our merchant service which is mainly responsible for the vastness and paramountey of our Empire, and the noble Earl who represents the Colonial Office would, were he in his place, possibly agree with me that the wonderful development of British possessions abroad is due more than anything else to the work of British merchant ships, which are the lines of our trade communications throughout the world.<lb/>
The source of our present Royal Navy was, as everybody knows, the merchant service. Merchant captains and officers have frequently rendered great national service to their country. Without our merchant service the war in South Africa could never have been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Even the latest and one of the very finest achievements in the field of exploration has been performed by a merchant shipmaster, Lieutenant Shackleton, formerly an officer in the Union-Castle Line, and now holding a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. I merely mention these matters to illustrate of what immense importance our merchant service really is, and yet, extraordinary to say, it is the one service which Parliament and the public seem to treat the least seriously. When first I introduced this subject of alien captains, officers, and pilots, it was only necessary to say that my proposals would tamper with the principles of Free Trade to make my case hopeless. I notice that allusion to Free Trade has, of late, been carefully avoided, presumably because otherwise it would greatly strengthen my case in the eyes of some of the noble Lords on this side of the House. How letting aliens supplant our own countrymen in our merchant ships can be considered part of the principles of Free
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0295"/>
<col>583</col>
Trade is a mystery to me. If it is a part of Free Trade principles, then to be logical Free Traders ought to let aliens supplant our own countrymen in the Royal Navy, the Army, the Civil Service, the Police, and other public departments, but I have not heard of their doing so yet.<lb/>
I will try to state, briefly, the objections of the Board of Trade to my proposals, for it is in the Marine Department of the Board where the opposition really lies. I am, of course, assuming that the noble Earl who is to-day representing the Board intends to oppose me as usual. The first objection is that the number of alien captains and officers is very small; secondly, that they are of different nationalities, and that, in any case, we have the shipowners on our side; thirdly, we are told of the desirable qualities of aliens in regard to foreign languages; and, fourthly, there is the fear of retaliation on British captains and officers serving in ships of other countries. I hope to deal with each of these objections in turn as shortly as possible. In the first place, if the number of alien captains and officers is comparatively trivial, then the other objections raised by the Board of Trade become trivial also. For your Lordships' information I should state that, according to the latest official returns, the total number of aliens employed in British merchant ships is 37,694, or nearly twenty per cent. in proportion to Britishers. In addition to this alarming fact there are 44,604 Lascars and Asiatics serving in our merchant ships. I think the time has arrived when Asiatics should not be classified with Lascars. There is a vast difference between the two, and whilst Lascars are British subjects, Chinese are even worse than other aliens. The practice of carrying Chinese crews on British ships is now becoming a very common one, and forebodes serious results in due time.<lb/>
Then, again, according to the latest returns, there are 472 alien masters and officers serving in British merchant ships. Since this return I have heard of a Japanese subject who has passed and got his certificate as captain of a vessel, so that would make 473, and there are 108 alien skippers and second hands in our fishing vessels. There are also 3,297 alien petty officers, representing over thirty-five per cent. of the petty officers serving in the ships of our mercantile marine. It is quite probable that many of these petty officers are aspiring to higher
<col>584</col>
positions and to obtain British Board of Trade certificates. I find also that there are eighty-one alien apprentices on British sailing ships, and ten on British steam vessels. It is almost a certainty that these apprentices will, on completion of their qualifying time, present themselves for second mate's certificates. This extract from a letter I have recently received will illustrate what I am stating&#x2014;
<quote>"My son informed me yesterday that there were two Dutchmen, a Swede, a Norwegian, and an Italian up at the South Shields School for either mate or master; this is a bit rough for Englishmen, and the sooner these certificates are given to Englishmen only the better."</quote>
The actual percentage of alien captains and officers in our ships is, no doubt, small, but they number 473, and, in the interests of the Empire, this is exactly 473 too many, for reasons which I hope will prove sufficiently convincing to command the support of your Lordships.<lb/>
As to the second objection, no doubt these aliens are of different nationalities, but I cannot see what difference that makes. In war-time even one alien master who is a subject of a hostile Power might do incalculable damage, as I will illustrate shortly. As to the owners being on our side, this is a. trumpery argument, for when their ships are at sea in time of war they would have no more power over them than we would, or, rather, not nearly as much. The third objection is the desirability of alien masters and officers as linguists. Such an argument is absurd in the extreme, and displays a totally inaccurate perception of the way in which our merchant ships are run. Take, for example, a vessel carrying an alien officer. The master is, obviously, not likely to transact his business through an officer, and in the case of an alien master his business is invariably conducted in the English tongue through the British Consulate and through the agents of the ship at the different ports abroad, all of whom speak English. On the last occasion we were told that at the Levantine ports, for instance, it was extremely important, in the interests of the owners, that one officer, at least, of a ship should be able to speak the different dialects. A more extraordinary suggestion I never heard of. The business of British ships at Levantine ports is always carried on in the English language, and to talk about aliens&#x2014;probably Germans or Scandinavians&#x2014;being more familiar than our own officers with the different dialects prevailing
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0296"/>
<col>585</col>
at Levantine ports is, on the face of it, absurd.<lb/>
Taking the fourth, and last, objection, retaliation is feared on British captains and officers serving in ships of other countries. The Board of Trade are really very solicitous. To this objection the reply is simple. The number of British captains and officers serving in foreign vessels is infinitesimal. They are almost all serving in American vessels, and they cannot obtain a master's licence in the States without in the first place becoming a naturalized American subject. If they choose to forswear allegiance to the English flag then they must take all the responsibilities for so doing. Your Lordships were not informed that practically all other maritime Powers confine the commanding and officering of their merchant ships to their own subjects.<lb/>
Having, I hope, disposed of these objections, I now propose to turn to the national aspect of the case. When the late Lord Ritchie (then Mr. Ritchie) was President of the Board of Trade he told us that if, in war-time, the Royal Naval Reserve were called out our merchant ships would be wholly manned by aliens. We may talk about naval scares, but this is one which would stagger any but an easy-going and careless nation such as ours. We depend upon the food supplies brought us by our merchant ships. What, then, might we reasonably expect, in time of war, of such ships carrying alien captains or officers, with the whole of the crew aliens? Are they going to be loyal to the flag under which they serve or to the flag under which they were born? The answer is obvious.<lb/>
I will take a further striking illustration which will show the grave dangers to which we are exposing ourselves by allowing aliens to command and officer our merchant ships. In the course of last session I addressed what, at the time, may have been construed as a very innocent question to His Majesty's Government. I asked whether any official notices had been issued to the effect that, in the event of war, certain instructions would be placed in the hands of captains of British merchant ships; and, if so, what form these instructions would take? Also, I asked at the same time whether the Admiralty had invited the captains of British merchant ships to supply information concerning the movements and doings of vessels belonging to foreign maritime Powers; and, if so,
<col>586</col>
whether the Admiralty would supply information as to the text of the communication containing this invitation.<lb/>
The reply of my noble friend the Earl of Granard, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, was more brief and concise than it was satisfactory to me. His response was that no official notices of the character referred to had been issued by the Admiralty, and that the Admiralty at that time had no intention of issuing notices of the type suggested by me. This was on November 10, 1908. Not for one moment would I question the veracity of the noble Earl who made this reply; it was prepared for him, and I will, therefore, dispose of it so far as the noble Earl is concerned. But I have a little more to say about those who framed this reply, and I must once again protest against the evasive way in which matters that I take the liberty to bring to the notice of your Lordships are sometimes replied to. I do not intrude upon your time without in the first place making myself familiar with the questions I bring to your notice. From His Majesty's Government we have had practically a denial of any confidential matter being entrusted to the captains of British merchant ships in time of war. Let me tell your Lordships that it is far the reverse. To show you whether the observations of merchant shipmasters, even in time of peace, are considered of some value, I may say that I have in my hand a copy of a letter which, at the instigation of the Admiralty, has been addressed by Lloyd's to the shipowners of this country. It is dated April 2, 1908, and reads as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"Dear Sir,&#x2014;I beg to inform you that a book entitled 'Block Sketches of War Vessels' has been prepared at the Admiralty for use in the mercantile marine in order to enable the masters and officers of merchant vessels in peace time to practise themselves in recognising war vessels at sea, and reporting them, when possible, to naval authorities.</quote>
<quote>"The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are desirous of securing the co-operation of shipowners in this object, and the Committee of Lloyd's have been asked to assist in the distribution to shipowners of copies of the book in question and to invite shipowners to instruct their captains to report, as far as is practicable, to the naval authorities the movements of any warships which may be observed during their voyages.</quote>
<quote>"In anticipation that you will be quite willing to assist the important object that the Admiralty have in view, I am forwarding under separate cover a sufficient number of copies of the block sketches for distribution to the captains of the principal vessels of your fleet.</quote>
<quote>"It is desired that the captains of the vessels to whom the copies are supplied should be invited to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0297"/>
<col>587</col>
report the movements of war vessels observed, either&#x2014;

My Lords, I should be the last to bring forward a letter of this character had I received a satisfactory response to my inquiry, but I am not to be put off by evasion, and I want to know whether, in view of this letter, the Admiralty attach no importance to the masters of merchant ships in reporting matters affecting our national welfare and safety. What is likely to be the result if a letter such as I have read falls into the hands of an alien master of one of our ships, which it will be sure to do?<lb/>
If I remember rightly, the Prime Minister not long ago said that he did not include the United States in calculating the two-Power standard. Let me give you a little incident which has been brought to my notice which shows not only what may be thought by the Americans of the new book of Block Sketches of Men of War which has been put into the hands of merchant shipmasters, but the way it may be looked upon by other maritime Powers. I have a letter in my hand written by a member of the merchant service who draws my attention to the letter from Lloyd's which I have read. He states that the first copy was sent to his ship at New York and was confiscated and destroyed by the American Government officials. I offer no commentary on this incident, but leave your Lordships to draw your own conclusions.<lb/>
I have not done with this phase of the situation yet. In view of the reply I received last session I should like to point to the notices which have been issued
<col>588</col>
as to the desirability of the interchanging of signals as much as possible between merchant ships and His Majesty's ships. But the gravest question of all which I ask is how the Admiralty reconcile their reply to me last year with the general notice to mariners which has been issued by the Board of Trade for some time? This is a notice stating that, in the event of relations becoming strained between this country and any naval Power, an examination service may come into force at the different ports or localities in the United Kingdom and His Majesty's possessions abroad. Masters are warned that before attempting to enter any of these ports they must, in their own interests, strictly obey all instructions given to them by the vessels which will be charged with the duty of examining ships desiring to enter the ports and allotting positions in which the ships shall anchor. The institution of an examination service at any port will never be publicly advertised, but at all times when the relations of Great Britain with foreign Powers are known to be in a state of tension especial care should be taken, in approaching the ports by day or by night, to keep a sharp look-out for the examination steamer, and to be ready to "bring to" at once when hailed by her or warned by the firing of a gun. The notice in itself is very comprehensive and minute, but what I have read of it will be enough to enable your Lordships to understand the nature of it.<lb/>
I understand that the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, representing the British captains and officers of the service, state that they have received no satisfactory reply whatever to their inquiry addressed to the Admiralty as to an alien master of one of our ships being given information of the strictly confidential description in the official notice. To give this information away to one single alien might be the means of inflicting incalculable mischief upon ourselves, and I venture to say that no reply can prove to the contrary. Again, I would ask what encouragement we are giving to our loyal and patriotic subjects in the merchant service when we allow aliens to dominate over them in our ships. Is this calculated to in any way remove the stain on our Red Ensign caused by the alarming number of aliens serving under it? From this point of view alone I would urge that my Motion is worthy of your Lordships' support. But I do not rely
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0298"/>
<col>589</col>
upon this so much as I do upon the urgent question of alien masters and officers being of the most serious danger to the State and to the Empire, for the preservation of which this country is chiefly responsible. And remember, my Lords, each of these aliens is taking up the place of one of our own countrymen who would be of the greatest value in any time of trouble, while the alien will always be a danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01036">Moved to resolve, That in the opinion of this House it is inimical to the interests of the Empire that aliens should be permitted to command or officer British ships. &#x2014;(<i>Lord Muskerry.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01037"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in replying to the noble Lord to-day in the unavoidable absence, through indisposition, of my noble friend Lord Hamilton of Dalzell, who represents the Board of Trade in your Lordships' House, I am at a disadvantage owing to the fact that the Papers have only just been placed in my hands. The subject which the noble Lord has raised has been before a number of Committees; and the Committee on the Supply and Training of Boy Seamen, which reported in 1907, stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"the employment of a large number of foreigners on vessels trading exclusively abroad or opening an agreement at a foreign port cannot well be avoided. As an example we may give the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, who alone employ 1,100 foreigners on board their vessels trading on the west coast of South America. Many vessels so employed in distant parts of the world only return to the United Kingdom at long intervals for overhaul and refit."</quote>
The Committee, in a subsequent paragraph, said&#x2014;
<quote>"Therefore we are led to the conclusion that&#x2026;a large proportion of the foreigners serving in British vessels must be regarded as a constant element in the mercantile marine."</quote>
The actual numbers employed as stated by the noble Lord were, I think, approximately correct. From the return of the seamen employed in British merchant vessels on April 4, 1906, it appears that 201,408 seamen were so employed, of whom 128,077 were British, 38,425 were Lascars, and 34,906 were foreigners. Thus more than half of the alien element is represented by Lascars, who are very largely British subjects. Your Lordships must also remember that nearly one-third of the foreigners&#x2014;10,100 out of 34,906&#x2014;are drawn from the
<col>590</col>
three countries of Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and without undue confidence it may be stated that these are not countries with which we are likely to have unfriendly relations.<lb/>
My noble friend went on to ridicule a remark I made some time ago with regard to the Levantine trade. He declared that all the trading there was done in the English language, and that consequently there was no reason whatever why British captains should not be employed on those ships. The information at my disposal is quite to the contrary. I am informed that any company trading entirely in the Levant and in the Mediterranean considers it absolutely necessary, simply as a business proposition, to have some foreign officers for dealing with the different traders in those parts. The British merchant service is a trade that fluctuates considerably in accordance with the prosperity or depression of the trade of the world as a whole. Thus <i>The Times</i>, in its annual review of trade last January, calculated that 1,250,000 tons of British shipping lay idle at the close of 1908. The returns from eighteen of the principal ports in the United Kingdom for the years 1907 and 1908 show that the number of men engaged in those years fell from 427,948 to 414,771. The numbers of foreigners in those totals, other than Asiatics or Africans, were 46,054 and 39,840 respectively. The fact, therefore, emerges that these foreigners formed about one-tenth of the total employed, but that they bore nearly one-half of the decrease made necessary by the year of depression in the world's trade. It would appear, therefore, that the alien may be regarded as having solved for us in some measure the problem of a reserve of labour in the mercantile marine.<lb/>
The noble Lord went on to refer to the question of retaliation, and stated that, in his opinion, if we limited certificates entirely to Englishmen the retaliation which the Board of Trade feared would not really take place. As a matter of fact, it appears that neither Germany, the. Netherlands, nor Belgium has any such restriction, while Italy, Denmark, and Norway enforce it only as regards the master of a ship. No figures are available to show the number of British subjects serving as officers on foreign ships. Their number must, however, be considerable. Let me touch on the actual number of certificates granted. In the year 1905 there were 4,322 certificates granted; out
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0299"/>
<col>591</col>
of that number only seventy-seven were granted to foreigners. In 1906 there were 4,565 certificates granted, of which sixty-six were given to foreigners; and, in 1908, 4,830 certificates were granted, out of which only seventy-six were granted to foreigners. Your Lordships will gather from those figures that there is no great upward tendency in regard to foreigners holding masters' certificates. We naturally regret that our merchant service is not manned entirely by people of British origin, but it must be remembered, in that connection, that we have the largest carrying trade in the world, and that it is, therefore, as all reports state, nearly impossible to man the whole of our ships entirely with Britishers.<lb/>
The noble Lord proceeded to criticise the answer I gave him last year on behalf of the Admiralty. I can only say that the reply I then gave was based on the facts supplied to me by the Admiralty. I was informed that no instructions had been given of any sort or kind on that point. The letter that the noble Lord has quoted was certainly not mentioned to me at the time. The Board of Trade have written to the Admiralty asking for any observations they might have to make with regard to the Motion of my noble friend, and, with your Lordships' permission, I will read their reply. It is as follows, dated July 15, 1909&#x2014;
<quote>"In reply to your letter of the 2nd instant, inquiring whether the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have any observations on the terms of the Motion which Lord Muskerry has announced his intention of moving in the House of Lords on the 19th instant, I am commanded by their Lordships to state, for the information of the Board of Trade, that care is taken as far as possible that confidential information from British naval authorities does not come into the possession of alien masters or officers of British merchant vessels in time of war."</quote>
Later the Admiralty say&#x2014;
<quote>"It may, however, be taken as certain that naval officers will exercise great care in any communication which they make of an important character, so as to prevent it from being used in a manner contrary to the public interests."</quote>
I do not think there is anything more that I can add on these points. This matter has been discussed very fully on many different occasions, and the conclusion arrived at, both by the Board of Trade and by the Admiralty, is that the danger to which my noble friend has referred is not so real as he seems to think.</membercontribution></p>
<col>592</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01038"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure that the noble Earl need not have made any apology to your Lordships for want of preparation in the statement he has just made, for it has been, as usual from him, of a very complete and satisfactory character. But I should have been glad if he could have added one or two more figures as to the progress of the number of foreigners in our merchant service. He did, I think, tell us that, as regards masters and officers, there was no substantial increase, but he did not mention any figure as regards men. If there were to be an increase, I think your Lordships would agree that it was a matter deserving our careful attention.<lb/>
As I have ventured to say to your Lordships on previous occasions, we have to weigh against one another the two aspects of this question. On the one side there is our trade and the necessity for the proper manning of our ships, and, on the other side, there is our national position and the re-action on our naval service of the <i>personnel</i> of the merchant service. I quite agree with the noble Earl who has just sat down that we must treat our trade and the <i>personnel</i> of our trade with the greatest care, and any extra weight upon the trade is so much against its prosperity and success; but I do not think we can leave out of sight the other side of the question, and my noble friend Lord Muskerry has done good service in reminding your Lordships and the country of the great importance of maintaining, as far as possible, the British character of our merchant service.<lb/>
The noble Earl said just now that all of us would wish our merchant service to be entirely British manned, and I think that is true. We all regret that it should be necessary to include in the service persons who are not British subjects. I do not say that principally because of what my noble friend behind me has called the confidential character of the position of masters of merchant ships in time of war, although I do not think the matter is so unimportant, perhaps, as the noble Earl made out. There is no doubt whatever that the information to be derived from British ships in time of war would be of great value to the Admiralty. Our ships cover every sea and have an opportunity of acquiring information which is to be acquired from no other source, and
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0300"/>
<col>593</col>
I suspect that the Admiralty would rely a good deal on information which reached them from the masters and officers of British ships. If that be so, I think my noble friend is justified in saying that <i>protanto</i> it is a matter for regret that the persons in a certain number of instances through whom this information would pass would not be British subjects but foreigners perhaps in sympathy with those with whom we were in hostile relations at the moment. I do not attribute the highest importance to the point, though I do not think it is to be treated with insignificance, as the noble Earl was, I think, inclined to treat it.<lb/>
But the main point is undoubtedly that the ultimate reserve of the British Navy must lie in the sea-faring population of the country. I should like to put it to the noble Earl whether the Admiralty have ever really thought out that aspect of the question. They have a splendid body of seamen now serving in the British Navy; they have behind them a most valuable number of the Royal Naval Reserve; but in a great struggle I imagine that not only would the seamen now serving in the Navy be exhausted, but perhaps the Royal Naval Reserve as well, and we should have to fall back on what we could get from the sea-faring population of these islands. I therefore ask the noble Earl and those whom he represents whether they have thoroughly thought out what reserves we really have behind us in the case of a very great struggle. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the importance of maintaining not only the actual <i>personnel</i> of the Navy at the highest pitch of numbers and quality, but also to have the reserve and the ultimate reserve carefully planned out in our minds in case they should have to be called upon.<lb/>
It is for these reasons that I am never inclined to treat the speeches which Lord Muskerry makes on this subject as unimportant. We are bound to keep a very careful watch on this question, and no doctrinaire ideas of what may be within the four corners of some Free Trade doctrine would ever restrain me for one moment from advocating even the most drastic measures of restriction if they were necessary to maintain the sea-faring population of this country at its present numbers, in order that when a time of necessity arose these men would be available. Therefore, I am indebted to the noble Lord for bringing the
<col>594</col>
question forward, although I do not suppose that on the present occasion he will think it necessary to divide the House on his Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01039"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to say one or two words in reply. I should like to point out that the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, which was mentioned by the noble Earl, run a number of steamers between Valparaiso and Panama, and as they are never off that coast they are naturally unable to get British subjects to man them, but all the officers on board those vessels are British subjects. Then there is one other aspect on which I do not think the noble Marquess touched. The noble Earl pointed out that there is an immense amount of tonnage laid up. That means the throwing out of employment of a number of captains and officers. There are no more loyal and patriotic men in the world than the captains and officers of the mercantile marine, and I ask, Is it fair that they should see their places filled by 473 aliens? As to the other point, I have been in the Mediterranean a good deal and have seen many English vessels trading there, and I do not remember one which was officered by a foreigner. But as the noble Marquess advises me not to press the Motion, I ask your Lordships' permission to withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01042">Moved, That there be laid before the House a Return showing the changes which would become necessary in the staffs of the public elementary schools under the several local education authorities in England and Wales, and the cost entailed by making such changes; such Return to be prepared so as to show&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01043"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Board of Education do not possess the information which is required for the Return. They could not give such a Return without calling upon the local education authorities to furnish the materials; and it is practically certain that even the local authorities could not give the information for their respective areas without undertaking a special and elaborate analysis of their records.<lb/>
Therefore, as regards heads (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>),and (<i>c</i>) of the desired Return, the local authorities would probably object to be asked to furnish the mass of detailed particulars involved. There are 150,000 teachers on the staffs of public elementary schools, and consequently head (<i>a</i>) alone may involve as many as 300,000 entries. As regards head (<i>d</i>) it would not be possible to give a Return based on paragraphs 3, 7, and 10 of the Circular showing the direct immediate results of the new regulations, as paragraph 10 will not be in full operation for five years, and paragraph 6 to which the noble Earl does not refer (size of classes and suitability of staff), is in many areas the most important part of the Circular. Moreover, there is this further difficulty, that it would be useless to include those very numerous authorities who do not expect to be affected, and that, in areas where increased expenditure is anticipated, the Board could not reasonably be asked to calculate the increased expenditure, nor would local authorities be likely to accept such calculations, even if the Board could undertake the task.<lb/>
The Board of Education agree with the noble Earl in thinking it desirable to have definite, and, so far as may be, accurate estimates of the increased cost directly involved in the new regulations, but the problem is not of the simple character suggested in the Motion. In the case of town schools especially it is not merely a question of improving the present staff with a view to the new scale of staff values for the existing number of scholars. Other matters must also be taken into account, such as the organisation of the school generally, the division of the scholars into classes, and the sizes of the rooms, and allowance must be
<col>596</col>
made for the possibility of meeting the new requirements by reorganising schools, reclassifying scholars, redistributing the available teaching staff in the schools in the area, transferring scholars to other schools, or regulating promotions and admissions. Trustworthy estimates can only be obtained when the calculations have been made and scrutinised by persons having intimate knowledge of the schools. The only practicable course is for the local authority to frame its own estimate, which can then be examined and discussed by the Board's inspectors. Estimates thus agreed to by the Board and the authority will be of greater value and give more satisfaction to both parties than calculations made on the lines suggested in the Motion.<lb/>
Soon after the issue of the Circular, the Board intimated that their officials would be prepared to examine any estimates framed by local education authorities. But up to the present time only twenty-seven out of sixty-three counties, eleven out of seventy-four county boroughs, and three out of 191 non-county boroughs and urban districts have formally submitted estimates. Estimates for sixteen counties have been examined. The remainder are either under examination, or the subject of correspondence between the Board and the authority. The Board hope shortly to present the results of the examination, but except in a few areas where the standard of staffing is markedly below the average, it will be possible to bring the new regulations into operation without any really serious increase in expenditure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01045"><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: The circumstance that so few authorities have thought it necessary to frame precise estimates is in itself evidence that most of them do not anticipate that they will be much affected. The change in the system of grants embodied in this year's Code will materially assist the local authorities in adjusting the organisation of their schools to meet the requirements of the Circular. The Board of Education will at an early date lay a statement showing in a summary manner the estimated financial effect of the changes made in the Code for 1909 in pursuance of Circular 709. The statement will show the estimates made by those local education authorities who have furnished the Board with figures, and will also show the Board's estimate, arrived at
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0302"/>
<col>597</col>
after discussion between their inspectors and officers of the local authorities concerned, of the initial expenditure other than expenditure on buildings involved by compliance with the new requirements. I may add that if there is any further information which the Board can furnish to the noble Earl, they will be glad to do so, especially if he would indicate to them what he would desire to have stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01046"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before this discussion closes I should like to say a few words on behalf of some of the county councils who are most seriously affected by this Circular. No doubt, as the noble Viscount has said, it may be difficult to give all the details asked for in this Return without getting very full information from the county councils, but it seems to me that before a Circular of this character was issued it was the duty of the Board of Education to form at all events some sort of idea as to what cost they were going to throw on the ratepayers in consequence of this change in the practice with regard to the staffing of schools.<lb/>
This Circular was issued at a singularly inopportune moment, namely, the very day after an important deputation had been received by the Prime Minister with regard to the serious increase put upon the rates by the Board of Education in the direction of medical inspection. The next day this Circular was issued, and obviously without any very correct information on the part of the Board of Education as to what its effect would be. Although the Board of Education took considerable exception to the estimates that were made by some county councils with regard to the cost, and although they state in the Code that the first estimates were the result, in varying degrees, of misunderstandings of the Circular which have since been removed, it is quite clear from the statement made the other day in the House of Commons by the President of the Board of Education that he recognises that, at least as far as counties are concerned, a very serious and heavy charge will be put upon the rates.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said it must be assumed, as so few authorities took the trouble to send in estimates, that there could not be any very great cause of complaint amongst local education authorities. But what is the case? Mr. Runciman stated in the House of Commons the other day that
<col>598</col>
the Board had received forty-one official estimates from local education authorities, but out of that number twenty-seven came from county councils, who altogether number only sixty-three. Therefore, without being especially asked nearly half the county councils sent in estimates with regard to the more or less serious charge that would be put upon them, and I find that amongst those estimates which have been accepted by the Board of Education as formed on a proper basis, there are more than one which will put considerably more than a penny extra rate upon the particular county. In fact, the President of the Board of Education admitted himself that he found that&#x2014;
<quote>"in the case of the counties the cost works out in terms of rates more heavily than in the case of county boroughs or urban districts,"</quote>
and he mentioned himself, as an instance, East Suffolk, which he said would work out at about a penny rate. I find, with regard to East Suffolk, that the calculation which is accepted by the Board of Education is that an extra charge of &#x00A3;3,575 per annum, to start with, will be put on the rates. A penny rate produces &#x00A3;2,948; therefore it is considerably more than a penny rate that is being pat on this one county. But I have particulars, which I believe have also been accepted by the Board of Education, with regard to the Lindsey division of Lincolnshire. The Board of Education recognise that the initial increase in the Lindsey division of Lincolnshire will be about &#x00A3;4,600 per annum. A penny rate in this division produces &#x00A3;4,676. There, again, there is a further penny put on the rates at a moment when there have been the greatest complaints possible of the continual charges placed on the county council.<lb/>
Let me make clear the position which, on behalf of the County Councils Association, I wish to take up. I entirely accept the statement made at the beginning of Paragraph 3 of the Code, that the policy of these changes, from an educational point of view, has met with universal approval by local authorities and other bodies and persons concerned with education. Our contention is not at all that we object to the educational effect of this Circular. No doubt it will be of very great advantage to the children of the schools in the future; but we are placed in a very difficult position by the constant practice, more especially
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0303"/>
<col>599</col>
of the Board of Education but of other Departments as well, of, when they find it desirable to introduce some new policy, placing the charge upon the rates. And they do it at a time when the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister for Education have declared, in perfectly clear terms, that they think the ratepayers of counties have very great cause of complaint and that they ought to be relieved of some of the rates now put upon them. I do hope that this matter will be further considered with regard to the counties.<lb/>
I quite admit that in the case of a large number of authorities there is very little difficulty. Where you have very large schools close to one another there is little difficulty in rearranging the number of scholars so as to comply with the regulations in this Circular without having to make any financial charge on the borough; but that is not the case in counties, especially in large counties with a scattered population and a large number of small rural schools; and it does seem to me that, considering the very strong feeling which has been aroused lately in those counties with regard to the extra charges put upon them, some more consideration should be given to cases which entirely differ from cases of boroughs and urban councils. We are placed in a very difficult position indeed. We all admit that this scheme should be carried out, but the thing we really object to is that the charge should be put on the rates and not borne out of Imperial funds. I know it is always said, in answer to us, that it is impossible to find the money in any other way, and that the ratepayer is the sole resort. I understand that the Board of Education are going, at a very early date, to receive a deputation, particularly from the County Councils Association, who, of course, will represent the case of the councils, and I do venture to ask the noble Viscount to use what influence he can to impress upon the Board that it is only fair that more consideration should be given to these particular county authorities, and that, smarting under injustice as they are now, they should not have a further financial burden placed upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01047"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I ought to offer an apology to the noble Viscount and to the House for not having made any remarks prefatory to moving the Motion which I have placed
<col>600</col>
on the Paper, but I did not do so for two reasons. In the first place, I raised this question a month or two ago in your Lordships' House, and I dwelt at that time very fully upon the objections taken to Circular No. 709, which has now for all practical purposes been superseded by the Code for 1909; and, in the second place, I rather anticipated that I might have received from the noble Viscount opposite a more favourable answer to my Motion, and that much of the information for which I asked would be furnished by the Government.<lb/>
The noble Viscount says that the difficulty in the way of granting the Return is the great labour which would devolve upon the local authorities concerned. Well, my Lords, I should not have put the Notice on the Paper if I had not first of all ascertained that it was not outside the bounds of the energy of a local education authority to obtain all these returns, and I think the noble Viscount will bear me out when I say that this and more than I have asked for has already been obtained by the County Council of Gloucestershire, and very likely by other of the twenty-seven county councils to which he referred. This is not a light matter at all. The noble Lord who has just spoken said that in many cases it would mean an additional penny to the rates. I venture to think that, where an additional penny is necessary to carry out the Circular of a Government Department it is not too much for the Government Department to ask the county councils concerned to prepare a return showing what, in their opinion, would be the cost in their own districts.<lb/>
I venture to enter a very respectful, but, at the same time, a very serious protest against the growing practice on the part of Government Departments of putting heavy burdens upon the rates. Some time ago it was boldly enunciated that the ratepayer and the taxpayer were the same person. I am glad to think that His Majesty's Ministers admit now that the ratepayer and the taxpayer are two very different people indeed, and it certainly does not seem to me to be right or equitable, or in accordance with the principles of our constitutional government, that the representatives of one set of persons namely, the taxpayers, should put burdens on the representatives of another set of persons, namely, the ratepayers. The
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0304"/>
<col>601</col>
noble Viscount has said that such information as the Board can obtain shall be laid upon the Table of the House. I do not know when that will be, and I do not quite know how soon they intend to bring into force the provisions of the Code of 1909; but I would venture to point out that this Circular was issued in a very sudden manner. It was not issued until after the county councils had prepared their estimates for this year, and I think it would be an act of justice on the part, of the Department if they could see their way to postpone the operation of this alteration in the staffing of schools until August, 1910. That would give an opportunity to county councils to include the cost in their estimates for next year, and we should really know what would be the increased cost that would have to be incurred.<lb/>
There are a great many supplementary teachers now being employed in these schools, who, under the proposals of the Board of Education, will have to give place to others. So far as I am aware, in most cases these supplementary teachers have given every satisfaction, and I venture to think that another mitigation of the burden the Board is putting on the ratepayers might be found in allowing these supplementary teachers who have proved adequate to the duties they have to perform to remain so long as the local, education authority wish to retain their services. In any case, I think that before the local education authorities are called upon to go to this great expense, and before Parliament allows the Code to pass, Parliament is entitled to know what the cost will be to the local authorities concerned; and I venture to hope that the noble Viscount will urge his Department not to carry the provisions of Circular 709 into effect until Parliament has had an opportunity of judging what will be the increase of the burden that will be put on the local authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01048"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the answer which has been given to the noble Earl's Motion is a very striking example of the way in which Government Departments, the Board of Education in particular, are apt to carry on their business. When a Government Department is about to issue regulations which involve the spending of money, it is customary for them, first of all, to consult those whose duty it is to find the money
<col>602</col>
necessary to carry out those regulations; but with regard to local authorities Government Departments seem to think there is no such responsibility upon them. I should have thought that the information for which the noble Earl has asked is precisely that information which ought to have been in the hands of the Department before they issued an Order of this kind at all. When the management of elementary and other education was given to the county council we were under the impression that, being the authority that had to raise the rate, we would be consulted before the duty of raising a rate was imposed upon us; but the Board of Education now think that without the necessary information, without any information, in fact, to guide them as to the way in which their regulations will affect rating, they are in a position to issue these regulations. This is an extremely good instance of the necessity for making inquiries beforehand. In many districts it may be found that the actual staffing of the schools differs very little from what the Board desire to get at. But the county presents difficulties in the way of making these regulations applicable to some of the smaller schools in the area without involving a very considerable amount of expense. The county councils do not complain of the aim and object of the regulations. What we complain of is the way in which these regulations are issued without any consultation with those who have to raise the rate, as to the way in which the burden would fall lightest on the county and the machinery by which it would be arrived at with the least expense. We feel that as we are the authority which has to find the money we have a right to be consulted in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01049"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to make one or two remarks in reply. I think I may point out the impracticability of consulting all the local education authorities in the country as to what steps they would propose for raising the money necessary for improving the state of elementary education in this country. It would be opening a controversy which would, I think, be absolutely worthless, and at the same time would create a great deal of confusion and mischief. I am in entire sympathy with noble Lords opposite with reference to the unsatisfactory relations between Imperial and local taxation, and I think the sooner that grave public question is settled the

<col>603</col>
better. I think my colleagues in another place have not shown themselves indifferent to diminishing the burden upon local authorities, for, unless I am mistaken, proposals have been made or will be made by which a large branch of the proposed new taxation is to go to the local authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01050"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: But it is still levied on real property only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01051"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: That may be an aggravation. I only wish to show that the Government are not indifferent to the unsatisfactory apportionment of public help which is given to local authorities. This is one of the questions which no Government can allow to stand over for any long period. There is constant conflict in consequence of the unfair&#x2014;I do not shrink from using the word&#x2014;apportionment as between local and Imperial taxation. With reference to this specific matter, my right hon. friend said in the other House last week&#x2014;
<quote>"I should be one of the last to say that I thought the State was making a sufficient contribution towards the cost of elementary education, but to give a grant in respect of this reform would be deliberately unjust to the best authorities, for remember that the standard I have set up is not a fantastic standard evolved out of my head or created by educational enthusiasts, but it is a standard which is surpassed by many of the education authorities in this country."</quote>
I think the sentiments there expressed by my right hon. friend should act as an encouragement to the deputation which will wait upon him, and to which reference has been made, and I can promise, on his behalf, that he will give their representations the greatest consideration. Beyond that I have no authority to go.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01052"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we all heard with approval and satisfaction the last remarks of the noble Viscount who has just sat down. As a past Minister for Education I naturally recognise the desire of the Board to improve the system of education throughout the country, but I feel that in order to attain that end they had not fully considered the extent of the expense which is placed on the local authorities. When I was at the Board of Education I was exceedingly careful to avoid any operation that might involve fresh expense to the ratepayers without having carefully considered what that expenditure would be. I cannot but sympathise with the Board in their desire to im-
<col>604</col>
prove the system of teaching, but I also feel that my noble friend was perfectly justified in asking the Department to find out from the local authorities what the expense would be before they made a hard and fast rule in absolute ignorance of the cost, and my noble friend Lord Belper has pointed out that the inquiry was not impossible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01053"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: Estimates have been already made in respect to a certain number of counties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01054"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: If that could be done by certain local authorities I cannot quite understand why it could not be done generally. Would it not, therefore, be well for the proposal of my noble friend who has moved this Motion to be considered, and the matter deferred till next year, or the year after, which would give time for arriving at some accurate idea of the burden which will be thrown on the shoulders of the ratepayers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01055"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only rise with reference to one point made by the noble Marquess who has just spoken. He asked why my noble friend behind me, the Lord President of the Council, objected to a universal return. The objection of the Department, as I take it, to a universal return is that it does not seem reasonable in a very large number of cases, where the requirements of the Code are actually exceeded, to compel those local authorities to make a return of the very elaborate nature for which the noble Earl asks. The assumption, I take it, of the Board of Education is that by now they have received a return from all those counties who consider themselves most prejudicially, or likely to be most prejudicially, affected, and I understand that a Return stating their estimate, and the criticisms of the Board of Education in cases where they do not absolutely accept that estimate, will be laid by my noble friend. I should have thought that this covered all the necessary ground. I confess I do not see why other local authorities who make no complaint, and, as a matter of fact, will not be affected at all, should be compelled to join in compiling an enormous Blue-book containing information which apparently is of no value to anybody. I am not at the Board of Education, and, therefore, am not competent to answer the noble Lord's question as to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0306"/>
<col>605</col>
whether the whole of this matter could not be postponed for a period of more than a year. Speaking without special knowledge, I think that must surely depend on the number of cases in which any grievance can be said to exist. If it is found that in the case of a large proportion of the authorities this Circular, admitted by the noble Marquess and by other noble Lords who have spoken to be in itself an educational advance, is to work smoothly and without cost, it does seem a serious misfortune that its operation should be postponed on account of a comparatively few instances, the difficulty of which it may be possible to meet in a different way, and postponed until we are able to deal with the whole question of local taxation, which, as we all know, is a gigantic subject. I was glad to hear from the noble Earl that he does not intend to press his Motion. I have merely made these few observations in order to make clear our position.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01074"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I put it too highly. At any rate it is approved by a very large number of people, and it seems hard to deem it impossible to consider the Bill merely on the absolutely subsidiary issue of a particular clause relating to Scotland. As I understand the matter, it is this. There are several bodies of accountants in Scotland who have a chartered right to practise in England. This Bill provides that on application they may be registered accountants to practise in England. Well, that hurts their <i>amour propre</i>. It apparently takes away something from them which they already possess. That may be so. I should think that their <i>amour propre</i> could be saved by their starting a register of their own and saying no English accountant should be permitted to practise in Scotland unless he asked for leave to be placed on that register. That would involve complete reciprocity between the three countries. But whether that is a feasible plan or not it certainly does seem to me to be a very strong order to refuse a Second Reading to this Bill on this very minor point. I should have thought a reasonable course would have been to have read the Bill a second time and not to have proceeded further with it this year if it be so desired, because there are, I think, very strong objections to sending any Bill even of this moderate degree of complexity to a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament at this very late season of the year. I should think that a reasonable course would be to read the Bill a second time on the understanding that it would not be proceeded with further, and then for the whole matter to be brought up again in the ensuing session with a view of then sending the Bill to a Joint Committee of both Houses.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01115"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member>supported the Amendment, which he said was more or less identical with one standing in his name on the Paper. Their Lordships would remember that on the Second Reading he indicated that this Amendment was absolutely essential in order to make Clause 1 effective in prohibiting the use of hop substitutes in the brewing, preparation, and preservation of beer. If brewers or publicans were allowed to add subsequently, the Bill would be useless to the farmers and hop-growers for whom it was professedly designed. He therefore willingly withdrew his Amendment in favour of the one now moved. He supported the Amendment for another reason. He believed it would be for the good of the people of this country that their national beverage should be absolutely devoid of, and in no way impregnated with, chemical preservatives, which could not but have a most disastrous effect, not only on the constitution of individuals but on the physique of the nation. Therefore, he hoped the Committee would accept Lord Carrington's Amendments on this point. He wished to repeat the assurance that in placing on the Paper the Amendments which stood in his name he had only one desire&#x2014;namely, to retard the annihilation of a great English industry, and one which was a source of more extensive and lucrative employment than any other agricultural industry in the world. In introducing his Bill on this subject he (Lord Hardinge) had claimed that it did not savour of Protection in any way, and this equally applied, in his opinion, to the noble Earl's Bill. Both Bills sought to give no advantage to the home producer which was not equally extended to the foreigner, and he maintained that both Bills attempted to secure absolute fair play, which he regretted to think up to now had been denied the English grower.

therefore, that Lord Carrington should have been accused, on the Second Reading, of having introduced a Protectionist measure. He maintained that it was nothing of the kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01116"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member>, who had a similar Amendment on the Paper, said that if the Amendment now moved was accepted his would fall to the ground. Lord Hardinge had spoken of chemical preservatives; but the real way the brewers were hit in the Bill was by the definition of "hop substitutes." A hop substitute was defined as meaning any article capable of being used in the brewing of beer as a substitute for hops either for "flavouring or for preservative purposes." Under that provision brewers were hit very hard. The noble Viscount had said that this was a Bill introduced to prevent the annihilation of a great industry. The noble Viscount came from a part of the country where hop growing was the chief industry, and his action in this matter could, therefore, be well understood. But English brewers could not use only hops for preservative purposes. An important Committee considered this subject in 1889 and dealt with hop substitutes and also with preservatives. The Majority Report stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"no deleterious materials are introduced into beer by way of substitute for hops."</quote>
Then, with regard to preservatives and sundry materials, the Report stated&#x2014;
<quote>"None are used which are positively deleterious."</quote>
It would be noticed that in the Amendment standing in his (Lord Mayo's) name he proposed to include under the expression "hop substitute"&#x2014;
<quote>"any noxious or deleterious substance capable of being used for preservative purposes."</quote>
The Majority Report of the Committee went on to say
<quote>"There may be doubt, as to certain preservatives, whether they increase the wholesomeness of beer&#x2026;but the importance of soundness in beer is so great to health that it would be inadvisable to discourage the use of preservatives generally."</quote>
It should be remembered that those who grew hops used sulphuring, and in the document they had issued containing their reasons against the Bill the brewers stated that&#x2014;
<col>616</col>
<quote>"practically no English hops are sold that are not sulphured, and, provided that the sulphuring is not excessive, brewers do not wish to interfere with that practice."</quote>
In olden days it was found that, when the old-fashioned sulphur match was burnt inside a barrel before the beer was put into it, the particular beer put into that barrel kept longer. Science subsequently discovered that there was no necessity for burning sulphur matches, and preparations were used which had the same effect. To say that that was deleterious or spoilt the beer or made it unwholesome was quibbling. After all, English people had been drinking beer for generations. Even if they prohibited the use by brewers of this substitute, there was the fact that when hops went to the brewers they contained a certain amount of sulphur. If the present definition remained in the clause English brewers would have to alter their mode of brewing altogether. He hoped the noble Earl in charge of the Bill would accede to the reasonable request that the definition of hop substitute should not include that particular preservative. It had been suggested that there might be a schedule at the end of the Bill of the things that were not to be used in beer, but it was very difficult to schedule everything. Lord Hardinge, in a recent speech, had alluded to German brewers. German brewers brewed at a very much lower temperature than English brewers. They brewed at a temperature at which a great many organisms could not have a being, and therefore German beer required practically no preservatives at all; but when that beer was exported a preservative had to be put in.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01117"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> said that Lord Carrington, on the Second Reading, stated that the Government had agreed to prohibit the use of preservatives altogether when the necessary preservation could be obtained by the use of hops. He wished to ask whether the noble Earl adhered to that statement. The present Amendment seemed to him to go rather far.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01118"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> asked the President of the Board of Agriculture to tell the Committee exactly what substances he was aiming at prohibiting. He (Lord Balfour) had been informed by two gentlemen engaged in the brewing trade, both Members of the other House of Parliament and both personal friends of his own of long standing, that if this Amendment were carried and the definition of a preservative
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0312"/>
<col>617</col>
remained the same the British export trade in beer would be absolutely killed. If the noble Earl could say that he was aiming at prohibiting anything which was of the nature of adulteration or anything which contained qualities that were deleterious to the people who consumed them, he would admit at once that the noble Earl had made out his case. He was as determined an opponent of anything in the nature of adulteration or of anything that did harm to the people who consumed the article in which the substance was put as any man could be; but, as he understood the matter, hops and preservatives other than hops were both necessary for the keeping and preserving of beer. Both hops and these other preservatives had their own functions to perform, and neither one could adequately take the place of the other. He was informed by his friends that the brewing trade agreed, without reservation, to the prohibition of what were called hop substitutes, but they held that substances which were perhaps in part substitutes, but which in the main were preservatives, had never been prohibited and ought not to be prohibited, and that if any attempt were made to prohibit them their Lordships would be going against all the competent evidence in the case, and that moreover, even if it were done, it would not result in any real advantage to hop-growers. He was told that it would not result in the use, for the particular class of beer to which he was referring, of a single lb. more of hops, and consequently it would not help the grower. If the Amendment now proposed were inserted and the definition of preservative remained as in the Bill, brewers would be subjected to grave and unnecessary loss, and in some cases it would go the length of the ruin of their business, and that without any advantage to the hop-grower. Therefore, unless the noble Earl could give the Committee, in plain language which they could all understand, a list of the articles he intended to prohibit, he would take the sense of the Committee against the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01119"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member> pointed out, in reply to Lord Balfour's point as to the necessity of having some preservatives other than hops, that many English brewers who exported beer did not use preservatives of any kind; and years ago, before chemical preservatives were used at all, it was customary to send beer for a voyage to India and back because that was thought to improve it. The hop industry would be wil-
<col>618</col>
ling to accede to the request for exemption in regard to beer for export if the brewers could prove that the use of the substances in question was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01120"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I hope and believe I shall be in the enviable position of being able to satisfy everybody. As regards Lord Mayo's question, I can satisfy him by telling him that his Amendment is covered by the Government's Amendment. Therefore he is perfectly safe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01121"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl explain how Lord Mayo's Amendment is covered by the Government's Amendment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01122"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The same wording is in my Amendment as appears in the noble Earl's Amendment&#x2014;namely, to insert the words "or preservation." I can also inform the noble Earl that we do not in any way wish to prohibit the use of preservatives generally. He rightly said that sulphured hops are not deleterious to health, and he added that it was reasonable that we should allow hops that had been sulphured to be used in the brewing, preparation, and preservation of beer. Then I have been asked whether the use of sulphur dioxide would be prohibited. The answer to that is No. Under my Bill sulphur dioxide can be used. Then Lord Balfour asked me to state what we were prohibiting. We are prohibiting anything that is a substitute for hops, and I think, in answer to his request to me to enumerate all the substances we propose to prohibit, I might ask him to say what substitutes he would propose to admit. I believe I may say that hop-growers generally do not in any way wish to kill the foreign trade or to interfere unfairly with any great industry; and if, and only if, it can be shown that the promotion of the foreign trade is necessary by putting some kind of preservative in the beer, in order to pass through the ordeal of the Red Sea and to maintain the trade in East India pale ale there is no intention on the part of the Government, or of the hop-growers, to throw any hindrance in the way of that trade's maintenance and development. The sole object of the Bill is to confine the prevention to hop substitutes only. There is no intention at all to cripple or injure the great export trade of brewers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01123"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> asked Lord Carrington whether he would accept later on the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0313"/>
<col>619</col>
Amendment standing in his (Lord Mayo's) name, making the expression "hop substitute" mean any article capable of being used in the brewing of beer as a substitute for hops for flavouring purposes&#x2014;
<quote>"or any noxious or deleterious substance capable of being used for preservative purposes."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01124">That was the whole thing. If the Bill passed in its present form, sulphur dioxide might very likely be regarded as a substitute for hops. Then where would be the brewer?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01125"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the Committee finds itself in rather a difficult position with regard to these Amendments, and I am not quite sure that the statement of the President of the Board of Agriculture has removed the doubts and ambiguities with which the point is surrounded. I think we are not in doubt as to what the intentions of the noble Earl are. He desires not to stand in the way of the use of any preservatives which can be properly described as harmless preservatives. But, then, is he quite sure that the wording of his Bill will not have the effect of preventing the use of these harmless preservatives? He was quite unable to answer the question put to him by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh and to give us an idea of the substances at which the provision is aimed. My fear is that the union which has taken place between the forces represented by the Board of Agriculture and the forces represented by my noble friend Lord Hardinge, who speaks for the hop-growers, may have the result of bringing very serious disasters upon the brewers, because there does seem to me to be a great deal of evidence, evidence which we cannot neglect altogether, to show that in regard to certain classes of beer, particularly certain classes of beer intended for foreign export, the use of preservatives is really indispensable. I am assured that natural hops do not act as a preservative against certain what are called spurious ferments which develop during the manufacture of beer, and that the only way of dealing with these spurious ferments is by using certain artificial preservatives. I believe it is true that hops and preservatives for beers of that class are both absolutely necessary, and it would really be a very serious matter if the result
<col>620</col>
of our dealings with this Bill were to give a check to the brewing of a particular kind of beer which is largely exported, and any interference with which would probably have the effect of dislocating a branch of the brewing trade. This really is a question for experts. The whole matter concerns the chemistry of the brewing trade, which is a very intricate matter. We must, therefore, look for guidance to the Board of Agriculture, and I own I wish that the guidance were a little clearer and of a kind that would enable us to vote with absolutely clear consciences when we come to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01126"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: I quite recognise the difficulty to which the noble Marquess has drawn attention, and it appears to me to consist in this. There is a general agreement that hop substitutes ought to be prohibited, and there is also an agreement that preservatives ought to be allowed. But the difficulty seems to be to distinguish between one and the other. In the case of sulphur dioxide the noble Lord opposite, Lord Mayo, said, How do we know we shall not be told that sulphur dioxide is a hop substitute? I do not profess to be a great chemist, but it is difficult to see how sulphur dioxide could be a substitute for hops. On the other hand, Lord Balfour let fall a sentence which seemed to me rather ominous. He spoke of preservatives which, although preservatives, yet might act as a substitute for hops&#x2014;some kinds of preservatives which, although described as preservatives, yet might be used as substitutes for hops. I confess that under my reading of my noble friend's Bill those preservatives would be prohibited on the ground that they were hop substitutes, and it might be necessary, therefore, to use some other preservative which could not be said to be a hop substitute, if it was necessary to use any preservative at all. I am bound to say I think that my noble friend behind me was in the right when he said, in reply to the noble Lord who challenged him to produce a list of forbidden substances, that, the objection being taken by the noble Lord, it lay rather upon him to produce a list of substances which he thought ought to be admitted. If there exist these substances which are half substitutes and half pre-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0314"/>
<col>621</col>
servatives, then I am afraid they will fall under the ban of my noble friend's Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01127"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> said that where a substance was a substitute and nothing else, he understood the brewers agreed that it should be prohibited; but the fear they had was that if the words now proposed by the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture were incorporated in this part of the Bill and the definition of a preservative remained what it was in the Bill, the article that had been mentioned&#x2014;dioxide of sulphur&#x2014;would be prohibited. That was the point. They wanted to know whether that was the intention and object of the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture. It did not seem quite fair that those who were promoting the Bill should ask him what articles he wanted to preserve for use. He frankly said that he would be willing to prohibit the use of any article which was a substitute pure and simple, more especially if it could be proved to be deleterious or in the form of adulteration. When a Government Department with all the machinery at their back proposed a Bill, surely it ought not to be difficult for them to state in plain terms what it was they intended to do, so that with that information their Lordships might apply their judgment to the question as to whether the Bill did or did not carry out the intention. That seemed to him a perfectly fair proposal and a much fairer one than had been put to him by the noble Earl opposite.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01145"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> desired to put one consideration before noble Lords who represented those interested in the growth of hops. Those who were interested in growing hops appeared to assume that because hops had a preservative action, which was not called in question, any other preservative, though
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0316"/>
<col>625</col>
it might have a different action and might be used for a wholly different purpose, was a substitute for hops. He could assure their Lordships that that was not the case. It was an absolutely unfounded assumption, and there was no scientific evidence to support it. Hops were a preservative against certain germs and certain evils which infected beer under certain circumstances, but there were other articles, which were also preservative, which had a different action under different circumstances, and the prohibition of which would not lead to the increased use of hops because hops under those circumstances would not be a substitute for the articles he had ventured to indicate. Therefore, it seemed to him of the greatest importance, to avoid litigation, that the matter should be made as clear as possible, and that a distinct list should be drawn up of the articles it was intended to prohibit so that they might judge of them on their merits.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01155"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member> moved an Amendment requiring the bags to be marked with "the name of the planter or grower of the hops" instead of as provided in the clause. The clause as it stood prohibited, under a penalty not exceeding &#x00A3;20 per bag, the importation of hops except in bags properly marked with the name of the owner, planter, or grower who packed the hops, of the country, district, and year in which the hops were grown, and the net weight of the hops. This Amendment, he said, would have the effect of securing that all foreign hops, from whatever country they came, should be marked with the same particulars, no more and no less, as were required in the case of English hops. This was agreed to by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he received the hop deputation in July of last year. Unless the word "owner" was deleted, they would have the name of the owner substituted for that of the planter or grower in respect of all hops coming into this country, and this, he maintained, would be absolutely useless for the purpose for which the Bill had been introduced. Any dealer would have a free hand in buying hops from different countries, mixing and manipulating different grades, and putting the name of the owner on the pockets just as if they were the unmixed produce he himself had grown. For over forty years this requirement as to marking had been obeyed by English hop-growers, and if the Bill passed without this Amendment they would be protecting the foreign dealer against the restrictions laid down in Clause 4 of the Act of 1866, which English hop-growers had to comply with; they would be confirming and making permanent the unfair advantage that the foreigner had stolen over the English grower through carelessness on his part in the past, and they would be giving the foreigner protection for his produce against the restrictions which the English grower was obliged to submit to.

It was, in fact, the Free Trade clause of the Bill. He knew there were some professed Free Traders who seemed to think that Free Trade consisted in placing the home grower under some disability. Those who were supporting this Bill wished to place neither the home grower nor the foreign grower under any disability whatever, but to place them on an absolute equality. It was a penal offence in this country to mix hops of different dates and to sell them indiscriminately. By the law of 1866 hops had to be marked with the name of the grower and the place where they were grown. It was proposed by this Bill to extend that protection against fraud to foreign-grown hops and not to allow the foreign dealer to mix all kinds of hops coming from different localities and of different ages. Under this Bill the date, country, and district had to be clearly marked on each pocket, as was the case in this country, and for the purpose of carrying out this clause it was very important that the name of the planter and grower should be the name that was placed on the bag. The name of the owner was not so important. It was impossible to trace the hops unless the name of the grower was on the bag.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01158"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> thought the clause as it stood might have an effect which was not in the contemplation of His Majesty's Government, and which would be intensified if the Amendment now proposed were adopted. From information given to him he believed that, even if the Bill remained as it was, it would accidentally have the effect of discriminating against Austrian, Bohemian, and Bavarian hops in favour of American hops. He was quite sure that could not be the object of noble Lords who spoke for the British hop-grower. He understood it would operate in this way. It happened that in Bohemia and Bavaria hops were mostly grown, where they were grown at all, by very small holders, who could not themselves pack their
<col>628</col>
produce into bales and bags. The hops were collected, he understood, under Government agency, and were packed in this way and exported. If that was the case, it was quite clear that they could not distinguish between the hops grown by particular individuals, but he believed that the hops when packed were certified by a Government stamp as having been grown in a particular district. He was certain that with the well-known sympathy of the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture for the small holder, he would be very unwilling to discriminate against a small holder even though he happened to be in Bavaria, and it could not be to anybody's interest that there should be this discrimination between the Continental grower of hops and the American grower. He wished to be sure that that particular point had not escaped the notice of His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01159"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member> failed to see why a Bohemian small holder should be given greater advantages than the English small holder.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01160"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> said he made no suggestion of that kind. The suggestion he made was that if the clause passed as it stood, the discrimination would be in favour of the American as against the Bohemian.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01161"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Lord Balfour has, with his usual clearness, put the case well. He suggested that there might be an effect which was not contemplated by those who wish to see this Bill go through, and he said there might accidentally be a discrimination against Bavarian hops and in favour of American hops. I can assure the Committee that that is the very last thing the Government wish to do, and if the noble Lord can point to any provision in the Bill which does do such an undesirable thing, it will be my first object to remedy that and to put the point absolutely straight. Lord Desborough said this was a matter of some importance. This Amendment is not only of some importance, but it is of absolutely vital importance to the Bill. The noble Viscount said that his proposal had been agreed to by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I have not got my right hon. friend's words, but I can assure the Committee that that is entirely a misconception. I will get the words, and I think I shall be able to prove
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0318"/>
<col>629</col>
that the noble Viscount is mistaken on that point. If this Amendment were carried, there would be another great objection. The great brewing companies, such as Bass and Co., have escaped from having their foreign trade killed, but if this Amendment is passed the home trade of Bass will be killed as well. Rightly or wrongly, Bass and Co. and other brewers have educated the British palate to the taste of Bavarian hops. There is no doubt about it, because Mr. Gretton himself made the statement before Sir William Collins's Committee. He said that fifty per cent. of foreign hops are used by the great firm of Bass and Co. in the excellent beer they brew. This is primarily a legal question. The noble and learned Earl opposite spoke just now as to the way in which the Judges would look on the subject. I dare not enter the lists with the noble and learned Earl, but I would point out that this is primarily a legal question&#x2014;namely, what are the requirements as to the marking of names on bags containing English hops. It is a legal question, and it has not to be settled by me but by the lawyers. It is these legal requirements and no other that the Government have promised to extend to foreign hop-growers, and the Bill, I am informed, carries out our pledge. I will read what my noble friend Lord Eversley said on the Second Reading of this Bill, as it puts the case in a nut-shell. Lord Eversley said&#x2014;
<quote>"Lord Carrington has followed the wording of the Hop Marking Act of 1866. Under that Act the name of the owner in substitution for that of the grower may be marked on the bag. Of course, as a general rule the name of the grower only is marked on the bag, but in the rare cases where the grower sells to any person who dries the hops in his own kiln then the name of the person to whom the hops are sold&#x2014;namely, the owner&#x2014;can be marked on the bag instead of that of the grower. If my noble friend representing the Government were to adopt the recommendation of the noble Viscount and exclude the word 'owner,' insisting that in every case the name of the grower should be on the bags, the effect would be to exclude a very large quantity of hops from the Continent."</quote>
Hop-growing on the Continent is a small industry carried on by small men, and it would be absolutely impossible for all their names to appear on the bags when they are sent to this country. If the Amendment is insisted upon and is carried, the Government will have to reconsider their decision; and if this Bill, which we are all trying to carry through in the interests of a hard-working and honourable body of men, is lost, noble Lords opposite must accept the position
<col>630</col>
that the full responsibility for its loss rests upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01162"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: If I venture to say one word, it will be in rather a less minatory tone than that used by the noble Earl who has just addressed us. His Majesty's Government are pledged&#x2014;I think there is no doubt that the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a distinct pledge to that effect&#x2014;to put the foreign hop-grower in exactly the same position as the hop-grower at home. My noble friend, therefore, desires that the origin of imported hops should be disclosed, in the same manner as the origin of British hops is disclosed, by marking the bags, not with the name of the owner, but with the name of the planter or grower, and that is, I must say, at first sight a perfectly reasonable proposal. But the President of the Board of Agriculture tells us, in effect, that those particulars&#x2014;that is, information as to the person who planted and who grew the hops&#x2014;are not always obtainable in the case of hops produced abroad, because such hops are very often produced on infinitesimally small plots of land and are handled by Government agents who mix them together and blend them so that the actual origin of the hops can no longer be traced. There does seem to me to be something in that argument, and what I should like to ask the noble Earl in charge of the Bill is whether, supposing my noble friend behind me does not press his words, it would not be possible to meet him in some other way. Would it not be possible, for example, to adopt in whole or part the Amendment which stands in his name further down on the Paper, an Amendment which, I understand, will have the effect of making it obligatory in the case of foreign hops that the place of origin of those hops should be indicated by a mark on the bags? I cannot help thinking that some compromise upon those lines might form a solution of the genuine difficulty with which my noble friend behind me desires to deal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01163"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member> regretted that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture had seen fit to doubt his statement as to the promise given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the hops deputation. Mr. Lloyd-George, in addressing that deputation, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have no fear of the principle which has been impressed upon me&#x2014;that you should compel these gentlemen to mark their hops with the country of origin and the date of origin. There is nothing unfair in that."</quote>

Then he was interrupted by a member of the deputation. The report proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. BANNISTER (emphatically): 'And the name of the grower, sir; exactly the same as we have to do in all particulars.'</quote>
<quote>"Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE: 'Quite right. Whatever conditions you impose on the British grower should be imposed on the foreigner.'"</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01164"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> said that so far as absolute equality of conditions between home and foreign growers could be brought about it would meet with his hearty approval; but the point he wanted to make was that this particular form of attempting to do that would have the undesirable result of putting one class of foreign grower at a great disadvantage with another. So far as absolute equality of treatment between all growers of hops in the same market was concerned that had his support, but he was afraid this particular provision would have accidentally a contrary effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01165"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> did not think the Bill as it now stood would have the effect which noble Lords feared. But if the Amendment were carried it would differentiate between hops grown on the Continent and hops grown in America. American hops were grown in very much the same way as English hops, and there would not be any difficulty in an American grower marking the bags with his own name; but the circumstances of hop-growing on the Continent, as he had explained in the few remarks he made on the Second Reading of this Bill, were quite different, and it would be absolutely impossible to mark them with the name of the grower. Therefore, if the Amendment were introduced it would practically prohibit all importation of hops from the Continent, whilst it would give an impetus to the growth of American hops, in connection with which competition had most to be feared by English hop-growers. He thought it would be very undesirable and not in the long run beneficial to growers in this country to accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01166"><member>VISCOUNT GOSCHEN</member> pointed out that there were small hop-growers in this country who had these difficulties to contend with under the present law. Their hops had to be marked in the manner proposed, and all that was asked was that the foreign hop-grower should be placed on the same footing.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01167"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am so very anxious to get this Bill through that I should be glad to meet the suggestion of the noble Marquess opposite.

We consider this Amendment absolutely vital, and we cannot agree to it; but I shall be prepared to consent to the postponement of the matter to the Report stage in order that it may be reconsidered, so as not to put noble Lords opposite in any difficulty as to how they are to vote.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01178">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01179"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member> moved to insert at the beginning, "Subject always to the provisions of Section 11 of the Licensing Act, 1902." On the Second Reading of this Bill Lord Lamington announced that he had introduced a fresh provision into the Bill which safeguarded the jurisdiction of the licensing authority under the Act of 1902. In his opinion this clause would not entirely meet the object Lord Lamington had in view, and it seemed to him that it would be far more satisfactory simply to state that this could not interfere with the law passed in 1902. Lord Peel's Commission took an immense amount of evidence and made certain recommendations. There was a Majority and a Minority Report, representing respectively the opinions of the trade and of the temperance party. In many cases those Reports did not agree, but on the subjects on which the Commission were unanimous&#x2014;that was to say, on which the Majority Report and the Minority Report agreed&#x2014;the late Government in 1902 introduced a Bill. It seemed to him that it would be exceedingly unwise to upset the Act of 1902, founded as it was on such a consensus of opinion and on such an amount of evidence. He therefore hoped the noble Lord would be able to accept the Amendment. Section 11 of the Licensing Act, 1902, required the consent of the licensing justices for any alteration on licensed premises proposed by the licence-holder if such alteration gave increased facilities for drinking or concealed from observation any part of the premises used for drinking or affected communication between any part of the premises in which intoxicating liquor was sold with any other part of the premises or any street or public way. This Bill should be subject to those provisions.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01181"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> said the Amendment would vitiate and destroy the whole object and scope of the Bill. What it was desired by the Bill to limit was not so much the discretion as the indiscretion of licensing authorities, who in certain
<col>634</col>
cases acted arbitrarily and refused to allow owners to improve their public-houses. He could quote many cases of this kind. He had that day been informed of a case in Lancashire in which a man was fined &#x00A3;100 for improving his lavatory accommodation. In promoting this Bill he had received the support of people who were closely engaged in temperance work, and in a letter from a worker amongst the poor in Glasgow stress was laid upon the fact that the majority of the working classes desired to be sober but, being human, they must have society. The writer added&#x2014;
<quote>"What is so sad is the general absence of facilities for intercourse."</quote>
If Lord Carlisle's Amendment were adopted practically the whole scope of the Bill would be destroyed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01182"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member> said he was not aware that any official view had been taken on the part of the Government in regard to this Bill, because, whatever their Lordships might decide, there was no prospect of the Bill passing into law this session owing to the congested state of business in another place. He thought the noble Lord was right when he said that this Amendment was scarcely consistent with the Bill, and this he pointed out upon the occasion of the Second Reading. He agreed that the Amendment read into the Bill would alter the Bill. What was this Amendment? In the year 1902 the late Government brought in a Bill, and it was passed, and by it the consent was required of the licensing justices to any alteration upon licensed premises, if such alterations in any way increased the facilities for drinking, or affected the communication, &amp;c. That was the proposal made by the late Government, and passed into law in 1902. It was in accordance with the proposal of the Majority and Minority Reports, and now all that was proposed by the Earl of Carlisle was this, that the powers of this present Bill should be subject always to the Act of 1902. They were told that that was fatal to the Bill. It was because he thought it would be fatal that he did not think that the House would be likely to accept the Bill when they really saw what it meant. He credited the noble Lord with the desire to effect a reform in licensed houses so that they might correspond with the refreshment <i>cafe&#x00E9;s</i> on the Continent. He believed he had this at heart. Let him (the Lord Chancellor) see what he asked, and the grounds. They
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0321"/>
<col>635</col>
had the Majority and Minority Reports, and the Act of 1902. They had been told that the noble Lord had received letters and resolutions, and that he knew of a case where there was a &#x00A3;100 fine, and therefore he complained of the indiscretion of the magistrates; but what did the noble Lord wish&#x2014;to substitute for that the discretion of the publican himself? He believed that the Amendment brought to light what was the frailty of the Bill, and he suggested to the noble Lord that the good intentions he desired were not effectively carried out in the Bill proposed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01183"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> thought that the language of the Report of the Peel Commission was not quite appropriate and that there was no objection to saying that the Act of 1902 was imperfect since it did not carry out what was really intended. There was no doubt that a great number of persons were prevented from going to public-houses by the knowledge that they were for drinking only, and they were aware that the desire in the past had been to make them disagreeable. Now what was desired was to make them agreeable, and places where a man could take his wife and spend an hour, and this he believed would be accomplished to some extent if this Bill were passed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01184"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that as Section 11 of the Act of 1902 was not repealed by this Bill it stood to reason that everything in the Bill must be subject to that section. The Amendment, therefore, was unnecessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01185"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> submitted that the Lord Chancellor had forgotten the attitude which the Government took up on the Second Reading. There was, he understood, a general concurrence.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01187"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said the whole object of the Bill was to attract the public from the bad public-houses to the better-conducted public-houses. That might, of course, increase drinking in the good public-houses, and therefore if magistrates, desiring to prevent the beneficent operation of the Bill, used their powers under the Act of 1902 the object of this legislation would be defeated. As their Lordships had agreed to the principle of
<col>636</col>
the Bill he imagined they would resist the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01188"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member> said that as he had an Amendment a little lower down on the Paper which practically came to the same thing, he would withdraw this Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01190"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member> moved another Amendment to Clause 1. The clause read&#x2014;

He proposed to leave out the words "licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors by retail," and to insert the words "to which an existing on-licence as defined by the Licensing Act, 1904, is attached." The object of the Amendment was to make the Bill applicable to all old licences, but not to new licences under the Act of 1904. Under the Act of 1904 new licences were in a totally different position from old licences. The magistrates were able to impose conditions on the new licences, and the new licences were to carry a monopoly value. There was to be no vested interest in the new licences, but if the new licence-holders were allowed by this Bill to increase their premises, and do certain other things, there would inevitably be created a vested interest, which was never intended.</p>

The magistrates will look first at Section 11 of the Act of 1902, and they will find therein that they are told, for example, not to sanction an alteration which gives increased facilities for drinking. Then they look at the Bill of my noble friend and they find that they are directed to have regard, so far as they deem practicable, to, amongst other things, the provision of accommodation for the supply of food and light refreshments. I cannot help thinking it could not be beyond the power of a magistrate, in deciding whether he is giving improper facilities for drinking or not, to be guided by the words he will find in this amending Bill.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01214"><member>LORD BELPER</member> thought it would be better to consider the point between now and the Report stage, so that the intention of the Bill on this point could be made clear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01215"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> hoped the noble Earl would not press the Amendment now. There was nothing in the Bill which repealed the Gaming Act. There did not seem to be a very clear idea in the mind of the noble Earl as to what music he wanted to prevent. On account of this small confusion he thought it would be better for the noble Earl to reserve the matter until the Report stage was reached.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01216"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member> said he was quite ready to reserve his Amendment. His anxiety in putting the Amendment on the Paper was to protect the Acts of the
<col>640</col>
late Conservative Government. He did not quite understand whether it was proposed to remove certain sorts of music and certain kinds of dancing out of the control of the justices.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01219"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member> moved an Amendment to delete the last paragraph in the clause with the object of substituting a new proviso. The Amendment, he said, had been practically already discussed, and it seemed to him the words he proposed would meet the object aimed at much better than those already in the Bill. There would, it seemed to him, be endless difficulties in the way of saying what would be the chief effect of the alterations in regard to the consumption of intoxicating liquors only. This difficulty was one of the points which came before Lord Peel's Commission, and the case was cited of a publican at Pontypridd who sent in plans showing palatial alterations, providing coffee-rooms, dining-rooms, and all the accommodation which Lord Lamington desired. When the publican received permission to execute these alterations he put up a long bar. This seemed to Lord Peel's Commission to be a state of things which required meeting, but he was not certain under the noble Lord's Bill whether it could be said such a bar was for the consumption of intoxicating liquors only. It would possibly be used for the sale of cheese and biscuits.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01233">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01234"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member>, on behalf of Lord Lytton, moved to amend the proviso that no alterations the effect of which would be, in the opinion of the justices, to increase the consumption of intoxicating liquors only should be deemed to come within the provisions of the section, by adding alterations the effect of which would be to increase the compensation which would be payable, if the renewal of the licence were refused, to such an extent as seriously to hamper the discretion of quarter sessions in refusing to renew the licence. He believed that this Amendment really explained most of the hard cases that had been quoted by the noble Lord in charge of the Bill. He believed, though he had no means of investigating the cases, that where facilities for improvement had been refused by the magistrates it had been probably owing to the fact that the houses were such that they would have their licences refused as soon as the state of the compensation levy permitted. He mentioned the case, in a very much over-licensed small town, of a beer-house which the licensing justices thought most suitable for diminution, it being probably the worst in the town. They were not able to refuse a licence to this beer-house because it was an ante-'69 beer-house; but as soon as the Act of 1904 was passed the brewery company which owned the beer-house produced plans showing great improvements to be introduced into the house. The magistrates declined to sanction those plans because it was their intention to refuse the licence of the house as soon as the state of the compensation fund allowed them to do so. They did so a year afterwards, but if the plans which had been submitted by the owners had been passed, it would have been impossible to have refused the licence. The house would have come into quite a different category, and there was no reason why this house, the worst in the place, should have an advantage given to it over other houses which were considered satisfactory. He believed that that would explain most of the hard cases quoted by Lord Lamington. Lord Lytton's Amendment was merely to give licensing
<col>644</col>
justices discretion to refuse to act upon these new facilities in cases where they did not think that the licence was one permanently necessary for the needs of the district.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01236"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> was unable to accept the Amendment except so far that he agreed to the insertion of the word "materially." He held that it was not likely that any man would lay out a sum of money on his house on the mere chance of getting compensation. He would in any case only get the amount he had laid out and certainly no gain. He did not think the noble Lord's argument that public-houses were improved merely to deter the withdrawal of the licence should be put forward unless he had strong evidence to support it. The basis of compensation&#x2014;namely, the difference of value between the premises licensed and the premises unlicensed&#x2014;would remain the same.</p>

In moving the Second Reading of the Bill, Lord Lamington said that the sole object of his Bill was that public-houses should be more open, not only to police supervision but the supervision which would be brought about by respectable people being encouraged to use public-houses for social and pleasurable intercourse.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01252"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill, as is clearly stated, is to extend the principle of the English Small Holdings Act to Scotland. In your Lordships' House on Thursday last the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said that by agreeing to this Bill your Lordships pledged yourselves to accept the principle of fixity of tenure and fair rents. That seems to me a wider assertion than your Lordships are prepared to accept. I am fully acquainted with the details of the English Act. I am a member of the Small Holdings Committee of my county, and the only rules with regard to rent are that in fixing the rent the county council shall take care that the rent shall be such that the county ratepayer shall not suffer loss, and in that they are supported by the Board of Agriculture. It will be within the recollection of the House that a Bill containing the principles referred to by the noble and learned Lord was rejected in this House, and I wish to safeguard myself from accepting the view expressed by the Lord Chancellor that this Bill pledges the House in any way to the principles of fixity of tenure and fair rent</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01253"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The exact words which I used I cannot recall; but if I said that the House had committed itself to the principles of fixity of tenure and fair rent I only said what I think. Not only under the English Act, but under the Bill of the noble Earl, a landowner may have his land taken for the purposes of small holdings whether he likes it or not. It is taken upon a lease, which may be renewed by the county councils whether the landlord likes it or not. When a county council possess a power to renew the lease in perpetuity independently of the will of the landlord, the result does not seem very distinct from fixity of tenure. And a provision that rent is to be settled by a valuer independently between the parties, whether the landlord likes it or not, is not very distinguishable from the fixing of fair rent. I do not ask the noble Viscount to accept my view, but I think I have fairly stated the effect of the clauses which, under the English Act, regulate the taking by the county council of land from the landlord.</membercontribution></p>

<title>AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01269"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> rose to ask the Lord President of the Council what steps had been taken to define the spheres of the Boards of Agriculture and Education respectively in the matter of agricultural education; to call attention to the Tables of Expenditure for Agricultural Education [Cd. 4569], of the present year; and to move for a Return showing the figures in column (<i>c</i>) of Tables I. and II. for the years 1906&#x2013;7 and 1908&#x2013;9.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01270">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in putting the Question which stands in my name I must ask for your. Lordships' indulgence because agricultural education is a very dull subject, and I am chiefly concerned with criticising tables of figures. Last December I called the attention of your Lordships' House to the Report of the Committee presided over by Lord Reay with regard to agricultural education in England and Wales, and great stress was laid in that Report on the necessity of increased grants for agricultural education. I called the attention of the House to a college in which my local authority is interested, and which is in danger of having its doors closed if more money is not available for agricultural education. We are waiting to see what action the Government will take on the Report of Lord Reay's Committee before we decide the fate of this college. But this is not a special case; it is the same all over the country. If we look at statistics, we find that since the year 1902, when the new Education Act came into force, such heavy charges have been thrown on the rates that local authorities spend&#x00A3;10,000 a year less on agricultural education than they did then. A deplorable feature in the situation is that the agricultural counties are the poorest counties; therefore, the counties which want more agricultural education receive less, and that is a matter which can only be remedied by grants.</p>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0329"/>
<col>651</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01271">Lord Reay's Committee gave very interesting statistics with regard to what is done in foreign countries for agricultural education. They told us that the Kingdom of Prussia, which has a population about the same as that of England and Wales, gives&#x00A3;100,000 a year, exclusive of local sums, for agricultural education. France gives&#x00A3;150,000. In South Australia one college receives from the State a grant of&#x00A3;9,000, which is nearly equal to the whole of the sums that are at the disposal of the Board of Agriculture; and in Ireland over&#x00A3;100,000 a year is given for the same purpose, exclusive of what comes from the rates. But Lord Reay's Committee could not tell us what sum was spent in England and Wales because statistics were not available, and I ventured last December to ask the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture whether he could grant a Return showing the amount spent in England and Wales. I made that request in order that we might compare what we do with what other countries do, and show, as I think we could show, that we lag behind in this very important matter. The noble Earl said he would try and grant a Return. Last Easter I put a Question on the Paper and gave notice to move for such a Return, but before the Question was reached I received a letter from Mr. Runciman telling me that he could not give the Return in precisely the way I had asked for it, but that he would give it in some form which he hoped would be of service. The result was this Command Paper No. 4,569, to which I would call the attention of the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01272">The title of the Paper is "Tables of Expenditure for Agricultural Education (apart from Secondary Schools and Elementary Schools)." I call attention to the title because I am afraid the contents have very little relevancy. The Paper is taken up mostly with explanations of the difficulties of granting information. Every foreign country can give this information, yet apparently it is difficult to give it here. I venture to suggest that the difficulties come chiefly from the Board of Education; the Board have surrounded their grants with so many regulations and restrictions, and have entangled them with so many other subjects that it becomes exceedingly difficult to disentangle them. I would ask the noble Viscount to turn to page 5. Table I., which is given on this
<col>652</col>
page, is headed "Exchequer Grants in aid of Universities and University Colleges which provide Agricultural Education." The first column is the column of the Board of Agriculture, and the total grants amount to&#x00A3;8,880. It is perfectly clear how this money is expended; there is no question about it, except that it is ridiculously insignificant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01273">In the next column are given the grants paid by the Board of Education in aid of professional and technological work, and they amount to the more respectable figure of&#x00A3;21,076. I was very surprised when I saw this column at the amount of money expended presumably in aid of agricultural education, and therefore I wrote to the Registrar or the Vice-Chancellor of each of the Universities and University colleges mentioned, and asked what proportion of this money was spent on agricultural education. They were all good enough to answer me, and I can assure His Majesty's Government that not one penny of this&#x00A3;21,076 has been spent on, or has anything to do with, agricultural education at all. I do not wish to weary your Lordships with the correspondence, but it is at the disposal of the noble Lord if he wishes to see it. I will merely quote the letter from the Vice-Chancellor of Leeds University, who writes&#x2014;
<quote>"In making our claim for grants in respect of technical work we have carefully excluded all agricultural students from our list. Consequently the sum received by Leeds University would be absolutely unaffected if we had not a single agricultural student in the University. Therefore it is preposterous for the Board of Education to claim that this grant is in any sense a grant in aid of agriculture."</quote>
I would like to quote to your Lordships the opinion of Lord Barnard, who is very much interested in this subject but is unable to be present to-day. He is chairman of Armstrong College (Durham University), and he states that, as far as that college is concerned, the Return of the Board of Education is misleading and ought to be withdrawn or corrected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01274">The next column in Table I. refers to Treasury grants. I think it is common knowledge to anyone who knows the subject of agricultural education that these Treasury grants have very little to do with agricultural education. I received a communication from Aberystwyth University College, in which it was stated that not one penny
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0330"/>
<col>653</col>
of the&#x00A3;4,000 which is credited to them had anything to do with agricultural education; and apart from a few hundred pounds which may be the proportion of the salaries of teachers who give some of their time to agricultural lectures, I do not believe any portion of the total of&#x00A3;42,900 under this head has anything to do with agricultural education. The last column in this Table is merely the aggregate grants as shown in the three previous columns, and is, consequently, useless. Therefore, on this Table I say that there are the Board of Agriculture grants of&#x00A3;8,880, and there are, perhaps, a few hundred pounds from the Treasury, but nothing whatever from the Board of Education.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01275">I would now direct attention to Table II., which refers to Exchequer grants in aid of agricultural education in county areas. Again in the first column we have the grants from the Board of Agriculture. They are perfectly clear and quite insignificant, amounting to a total of&#x00A3;3,350. Then we have the Board of Education grants amounting to&#x00A3;7,847, and I should like to criticise that having regard to the value of the previous column of the Board of Education. The Board of Education in the year 1906 issued some new technical instruction regulations, and under section 34 of those regulations they produced a new system of giving grants for agriculture and other purposes. They called it the "block grant system." It was an inclusive grant to local authorities for the local authorities to decide in what way it should be spent, with the approval, of course, of the Board of Education. In his evidence before Lord Reay's Committee, Mr. Ogilvie, who represented the Board of Education, laid great stress on this block grant system, and it might be gathered from his evidence that the Board relied largely upon it in order to develop their system of agricultural education. If you look at this Table you see that the counties in receipt of money under the block grant system are indicated, and if you add up the money given in this column under the block grant system as opposed to what is given otherwise, you find that the block grant system comprises the major part of the money. Out of the&#x00A3;7,847 more than&#x00A3;4,000 was given under the block grant system. I contend that this money does not go to agriculture at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01276">Take the county of Wiltshire, which receives the largest amount in this column&#x2014;
<col>654</col>&#x00A3;692. Before the block grant system was instituted the county of Wiltshire was only receiving&#x00A3;55. Therefore, this is a great advance for that county, and one might suppose that the accounts of the county of Wiltshire would show a corresponding increase in agricultural education. But what are the facts? The expenditure of the county of Wiltshire on agricultural education is very nearly what it was five years ago; consequently none of this&#x00A3;692 has gone to agricultural education. I venture to suggest that the block grant system does not aid agricultural education at all, but, as in the county of Wiltshire, the money has merely gone to the relief of the rates. The same remark applies to East Suffolk. I believe none of the money credited to East Suffolk under the block grant system has been spent on agricultural education. I think the block grant system has proved unsuitable to the agricultural community. I know that in my own county the regulations with which it is hedged are extremely tiresome, and that, so far as our farmers are concerned, we have never been able to make use of the block grant system or to get any money out of it. You cannot treat farmers as you would a class of boys learning wood-carving or young ladies taking drawing lessons. You cannot give them grants according to the number of their attendances and according to the hours they are there per week. They have their business to attend to, and they have a long way to come, and their business naturally makes their hours very varied. Therefore, the block grant system has proved a failure, and I think it should not be relied upon, as it apparently is, by the Board of Education to increase agricultural education. At the same time, Lord Reay's Committee reported very strongly in favour of itinerant lectures, and it would be a great misfortune if they were not assisted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01277">There is another criticism I wish to make of the Board of Education in this respect. The Board of Education grants are very unfair in their incidence. I will take a large agricultural county, the county of Norfolk. At the last census the agricultural population of the county was 47,000, and the grant from the Board of Education for agricultural purposes is only&#x00A3;46; but the county of Hereford, with an agricultural population of only 15,000, has a grant of&#x00A3;391. There is another way of criticising these Board of Education regulations. It may be said that the Board spend their
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0331"/>
<col>655</col>
money in proportion to what the local authorities spend, but even in that way their system does not hold water. Lancashire spends&#x00A3;7,600 a year on education, and the grant is&#x00A3;27, together with&#x00A3;242 for a small agricultural college. Meanwhile the county of Cheshire, which only spends&#x00A3;4,700, gets a grant of&#x00A3;587. There is neither justice nor reason in the way in which these grants are allocated. I need not call your Lordships' attention to the last column of this Table&#x2014;"Board of Education grants for further education (including technical) in agricultural areas." That is not agricultural education and has nothing to do with it. It may include singing, wood-carving, and anything else.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01278">I have wearied your Lordships with these figures in order to make some estimate, if one can, from this Paper, of what the Government really does spend on agricultural education. Under the first Table I find that the Board of Agriculture grants amount to&#x00A3;8,880, with a hundred or two more from the Treasury&#x2014;say&#x00A3;9,000 in all. Then we have under Table II. Board of Agriculture grants amounting to&#x00A3;3,350, and if you deduct the block grants from the Board of Education table you have a further&#x00A3;3,500&#x2014;that makes a sum total of money spent on agricultural education in England and Wales of the ridiculous figure of about&#x00A3;16,000. I do not think it is fair on the farmers of this country, who have a great deal drawn from them through the rates, that they should receive so little from His Majesty's Government in comparison with what is spent on the promotion of agricultural education by foreign countries. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, who is setting up so many small holdings, will, I am sure, appreciate that fact. I believe that this deplorable result is largely due to the fact that you have these two Departments&#x2014;the Board of Education and the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;who are not in agreement with one another. At any rate, there is a great deal of overlapping and underlapping, and agricultural colleges fall between both and receive very little assistance. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture told us last December that there were intricate questions which must be thrashed out before any system could be devised for complete co-ordination of agricultural education. I know that in my own county we have been refused assistance by the Board of Education because questions between that Board and the
<col>656</col>
Board of Agriculture were under consideration. That was nearly a year ago, and I hope the noble Viscount or the noble Earl will be able to give some information to-day with regard to an arrangement between the two bodies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01279">I am not going into the spheres of influence suggested by Lord Reay's Committee and the delimitation between the two Departments; but I will merely say this, that as the Board of Agriculture advise the farmer, my humble opinion is that they should also train the farmer, and that the line should be drawn below the agricultural college and above the evening school. At any rate, I can say that it will not be a popular matter for farmers if their colleges are taken over by the Board of Education. Here is a resolution of the Farmers' Club on that point&#x2014;
<quote>"The influence of the Board of Education has not been felt, and there has certainly been no driving power in connection with technical training in agricultural matters."</quote>
The agricultural produce of this country amounts to from 150 millions to 200 millions a year, and it really is a matter of importance that the utmost scientific knowledge should be given to its development.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01280">The Chancellor of the Exchequer told us the other day that there was to be a Development Fund of&#x00A3;200,000, and that some of it, at any rate, was to be used for agricultural colleges. Perhaps His Majesty's Government can tell us whether that money is going to be spent through the Board of Education or through the Board of Agriculture. I have put down a Motion for Papers. After what I have heard from the Universities I will not press for the figures in Column (<i>c</i>) of Table I., but having regard to the necessity of criticising the development of block grants I do move for the figures in column (<i>c</i>) of Table II. I move for these figures in order to ascertain the progress of the block grant, and when we have got them we shall be able to see what effect the block grant has had on agricultural education. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01281">Moved, That there be laid before the House a Return showing the figures in Column (<i>c</i>) of Table II. of the Tables of Expenditure for Agricultural Education [Cd. 4569.] for the years 1906&#x2013;7 and 1908&#x2013;9.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Monk Bretton</i>.)</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01282"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend the President of the Council has asked me to reply to this Question for him, and, with your Lordships' permission, I will do so. I hope my noble friend opposite will forgive me if I do not go in detail into the points that have been raised in his interesting speech, but I hope I shall be able to reassure him that some progress has been made. I am happy to say that we have this morning arrived at some understanding which will be of advantage to both Departments. The Board of Education and the Board of Agriculture have arranged general lines of direct co-operation in relation to the educational work carried on for rural areas, and in particular with a view to the improvement and extension of specialised instruction in all grades bearing on agriculture, and the maintenance of a close relation between such instruction and the practice and progress of the various sections of the industry. An inter-departmental committee of officers of the two Boards will consider questions that may arise as to correlation of work and of grants. It is further proposed to bring outside agricultural opinion into direct contact with the Board of Education by constituting a rural education conference consisting mainly of representatives of county councils and of agricultural associations. At the present moment I am unable to give any more details of the proposal, but everything is working most harmoniously between the two Departments, and I hope at an early date to be able to give some further details to noble Lords who take an interest in this subject. As to the Motion for a Return showing the figures for the years 1906&#x2013;7 and 1908&#x2013;9, my right hon. friend Mr. Runciman wishes me to say that the Board of Education are laying on the Table the figures asked for by my noble friend as regards the year 1906&#x2013;7, but the figures asked for in respect of the year 1908&#x2013;09 are not yet available, as that year does not expire till the end of the present month. I hope that the statement I have made will be satisfactory to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01283"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it seems to me that the criticisms which my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton has made on this Return are at all events worthy of some reply. To my mind, my noble friend proved conclusively that this Paper,
<col>658</col>
which is issued on the responsibility of the Board of Education, which is a Parliamentary Paper, and which will have the effect, if it is not challenged, of leading the country to believe that very considerable sums are given for agricultural education, is entirely misleading; and I am bound to say I had expected that some attempt would be made to make out a case in answer to the undoubtedly strong criticisms made by my noble friend.<lb/>
This is a matter of the utmost importance. The Return, if it is not challenged, will be relied upon, and we shall be told afterwards, if the figures in the Return are accepted, that we are doing very little with the large sums of money given by the Board for agricultural education. The matter is of such great importance that I should like to dwell for a moment on a particular part of the Paper to which my noble friend has not referred&#x2014;Column (<i>d</i>) on page 8, which professes to set out the grants for agricultural education in the different counties. That column totals a sum of&#x00A3;23,377, and, if my information is correct, a very small part indeed of that can in any way be said to be devoted to agricultural education. I have said that the Return is misleading. I do not wish to say that we are being purposely misled, but I do say this, that at all events the explanation with regard to that column is a very remarkable one indeed. I would ask noble Lords who have this Paper in their hands to turn to page 7, where it is explained how these figures are arrived at. It is there stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"the grants paid under the regulations for the year 1907&#x2013;8 for all schools and classes situate in <i>areas predominantly agricultural</i> have been separated out, and the figures thus arrived at for each county will be found in Column (<i>d</i>) of Table II. These figures, of course, relate not merely to the work done in classes in specialised agricultural technology &#x2026;but include all other county provision of technical and further education for these agricultural areas."</quote>
That is to say, these specific figures which we suppose are for agricultural education include all the grants given for other subjects, supposing they are in what are called "predominantly agricultural areas." This is the process. A certain number of areas are picked out, not by the counties themselves but by the Board of Agriculture, as being predominantly agricultural, and then all the grants within those areas for any purpose whatever are set down in the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0333"/>
<col>659</col>
Return as money given and received for agricultural education.<lb/>
Let me go a little further and show how this works out in practice. Having some knowledge of the money which we receive in my own county&#x2014;the county of Nottingham&#x2014;I was astonished to find, in looking over this Paper, that under heads (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), and (<i>d</i>) a considerable sum was paid to the county of Nottingham for agricultural education which certainly is not received or used for that purpose. In column (<i>d</i>) I find that the grants to Nottingham are set out as&#x00A3;620. I have taken the trouble to get the officials responsible in my county to work out the figures, and out of that&#x00A3;620 we can only trace&#x00A3;532. The Paper, however, admits that the figures are very approximate; therefore, I suppose we may consider the&#x00A3;620 as pretty accurate. How is this&#x00A3;532 accounted for? I find that the "predominantly agricultural areas" contain a number of places which are not predominantly agricultural at all. There are several places containing a large number of miners, and I find that the greater part of the grants which make up the sum of&#x00A3;532 are for mining, engineering, and matters of that sort, and the only sum which can be traced as going to rural education is&#x00A3;84. If the figures in respect of the other counties are as accurate as these figures, you may safely divide the total of&#x00A3;23,377 by about seven, and then you will be much nearer the mark as to the amount that is given for agricultural education.<lb/>
One word on another point. I very much regret that my noble friend Lord Reay, who was chairman of the Agricultural Education Committee, is not able to be in his place to-night. He asked me to represent him as far as I could, but I am fully aware that it would have given much more weight if the noble Lord himself had been here to speak on these matters especially on those which refer to the manner in which agricultural education should be carried on in the future. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture stated that an arrangement was being come to between the Board of Agriculture and the Board of Education. I sincerely hope that this arrangement will not be drawn up in a spirit adverse to the recommendation of the Committee of which I was a member and over which
<col>660</col>
Lord Reay presided. I would call attention to the particular part of the Report which contains their recommendations with regard to this matter. The Committee stated&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee have come to the conclusion that scientific and practical instruction in agricultural subjects when provided by Universities, agricultural colleges, farm institutes, and winter schools by means of special classes should be under the Board of Agriculture, whilst all instruction in agricultural subjects forming part of courses in such primary or secondary or evening schools as are in definite communication with elementary schools should be under the Board of Education."</quote>
I refer to that because that proposal has been supported by almost everybody interested in agriculture in this country. The County Councils Association passed a Resolution in favour of that division. Most of the great agricultural bodies supported it also, and the teaching bodies, such as the colleges themselves and the Universities, were also in favour of that division; and if the arrangement which has been arrived at is likely to be adverse to that decision and to continue the dual control which is now so unfortunate for agriculture, I am afraid it will be injurious to the establishment of a national system of education, which, to my mind, is one of the most important questions now before the country. It would be very difficult to have a national system of education, going up from the bottom to the top rung of the ladder and giving those interested in agriculture every opportunity of receiving the highest possible education afforded by the Universities, if there are to be two controlling bodies, one body having part of the system under its control, while the other body deals with a different part of the same subject.<lb/>
I am aware that we have no information to go upon as to what the proposals of the Government are with regard to this matter. I hope that this Development Grant is going to afford a substantial sum, which will really start a national system of education. If that is done, and if the system is put under the Board of Agriculture, who are in direct touch with the farmers, to whom the farmers look for assistance, especially in the scientific part of their work, and in whom the farmers have expressed their confidence by repeated resolutions, then I think there is a chance in this country of a great development, which will be of the greatest possible benefit to the agricultural interests of this
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0334"/>
<col>661</col>
country. I should deprecate any solution which would be likely to continue the present unfortunate state of affairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01284"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton, in the course of his observations apologised for the dulness of the subject which he was bringing before your Lordships' House. I cannot help thinking he was too apologetic. The subject is one, to my mind, of immense importance, and a most interesting subject. I hope many of your Lordships have looked, as my two noble friends evidently have looked, carefully into the Report of Lord Reay's Committee. It is an extremely painful Report to read. It appears to me to show conclusively that in this country we have fallen lamentably behind other countries in what we have done for the agricultural education of our people. I will not enter into details, but throughout the Report you will find evidence of the neglect in this country of agricultural education both elementary and higher, and the result is that, as the Committee have to tell us, a desire for knowledge of this kind is not a marked attribute of the agricultural classes in England. How should it be a marked attribute amongst the agricultural classes when the Government has shown such extraordinary indifference?<lb/>
The Committee go on to report that the agricultural system pursued in many parts of the country is of a most thriftless and unscientific character. And they go as far as this&#x2014;they say that every branch of agriculture in this country is capable of improvement. That is a very serious indictment; and when they come to the question of the teachers who are entrusted with the task of imparting this kind of education to the children in the agricultural districts, the Committee tell us that the education given in these schools leads those who receive it to forsake the land. At a time when the noble Earl opposite is doing so much to attract people back to the land, is it not rather absurd that another Department of the State should be giving them an education which leads them, not to the land, but to forsake the land? I think my two noble friends showed conclusively that even the not very extravagant amounts which appear in this Return as spent upon agricultural education do not really find their way to
<col>662</col>
that education at all. The figures are entirely misleading, and my noble friend assures us that for the whole of England and Wales something like&#x00A3;16,000 only is spent on agricultural education&#x2014;a startling and unsatisfactory figure, if it be correct.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite gave us, as usual, a very conciliatory answer. It appears, however, that only this morning His Majesty's Government were able to come to a conclusion of some kind upon this most momentous question. I gather from the noble Earl that His Majesty's Government are determined that there is to be co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Education with a view to the improvement of the agricultural education given. They desire closer relations between the two Boards. There is to be an inter-departmental committee and a rural education conference. Well, these are very important suggestions and indicate a most favourable spirit on the part of the two Departments concerned, but they do not really carry us very much further in the direction of the kind of knowledge which my noble friends desire to obtain. The noble Earl was entirely silent upon one of the most important points. Do His Majesty's Government under this new system, or do they not, intend to adopt the recommendation made by Lord Reay's Committee&#x2014;the recommendation, I mean, that higher agricultural education should be under the Board of Agriculture and elementary agricultural education under the Board of Education? That really is a question of policy, and although the Report of Lord Reay's Committee was laid before Parliament in the month of July, 1908, exactly a year ago, His Majesty's Government appear not even at the conference of this morning to have been able to face that question of fundamental policy.<lb/>
Nor, again, did the noble Earl, so far as I was able to follow him, say one syllable upon the question of funds. Is it the intention of His Majesty's Government to follow the recommendation of the Committee and to be a little more liberal in their dealings with agricultural education? Of course, I do not at this moment expect the noble Earl to come down and promise a colossal expenditure on agricultural education, but I think a few encouraging words, after what was said by the noble Lord who moved the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0335"/>
<col>663</col>
Motion, might well have been spoken. I must say that this question does seem to me a very critical one at the present time, because it is quite clear that in the view of His Majesty's Government the time has come for replacing the system of land tenure with which we are familiar in this country by a different system&#x2014;a system which will place the cultivator of the land in a position of much greater independence and much more closely under the Government and less under his landlord than heretofore. If that is going to be your policy in the future, does it not follow that it is your duty to do all you possibly can to educate those people who are really going to be their own masters upon their own holdings? The whole position is, I think, wisely summed up in a single sentence by my friend Sir Horace Plunkett. He said, in a paper published recently, that what we want in these days are not merely economic holdings, but an economic system and an economic man to carry it out. And you will not get the economic man to carry out the economic system unless the Government of this country take some pains to give him a proper education.</membercontribution></p>

<title>JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01286"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member>rose to call attention to the present methods of selecting and appointing Justices of the Peace, and to move, "That a Select Committee be appointed to consider and report whether any and what steps should be taken to facilitate the selection of the most suitable persons to be Justices of the Peace irrespective of creed and political opinion."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01287">The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I trust that you will allow me to occupy your attention for a short time while I bring to your notice a subject which I think ought to be regarded as one of considerable importance. I say of considerable importance because anything that affects the administration of justice in this country must be of great interest to everyone who has care for our institutions, and the nomination and selection of justices is certainly most directly connected with that administration. The position of Justice of the Peace is an ancient and most responsible one. For some six hundred years Justices of the Peace have been nominated by the Crown to administer justice. Justices
<col>664</col>
of the Peace are Judges of Record, and, as your Lordships know, have responsible judicial duties to discharge. They can sentence accused persons to months of imprisonment, and may determine whether a man shall be tried for serious offences, including murder. Then there are their administrative duties which, though diminished by recent legislation, still require the exercise of great discretion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01288">I ask you to consider what manner of man it is who ought to occupy this office? I am aware that it is not possible to set up a very high standard, but the standard ought to be one of sufficiency. Justices have to expound and administer the Statutes of the Realm. They ought to be literate; they ought to be intelligent&#x2014;and in intelligence I include the possession of commonsense&#x2014;and, lastly, they ought to be persons of undoubted high personal character. Those are the only qualifications that I claim should be possessed by Justices of the Peace. Recent legislation has got rid of the property qualification affecting county Justices, and that unhappy term "social position" gives way before the increase of democratic influence and power. I am led to the conclusion that the qualifications to which I have referred are little attended to in connection with the nomination of persons for this position. For a period of seven years I had to deal with the nomination of borough Justices in the county of Lancaster, and I do not know that those who made the recommendations to me took any trouble to inquire into these qualifications.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01289">The system pursued in the selection of Justices&#x2014;I am speaking for the moment of borough Justices&#x2014;is very definite. It seems to be this. The first step of a person who desires to be made a Justice of the Peace is to become an active politician, and then, having served his Party thoroughly, and, as someone once wrote to me, having done "a great deal of work after dark," he appeals to the local party manager. He says, "I have done good work for the Party. The other side made so many Justices for political reasons, and, being entitled to that position, I ask you to see that I secure it." Then the local party manager appeals to the general party manager of the district; the matter is carried forward and the aid of the Member of Parliament is enlisted, the assurance being given that "Mr. So-and-so wishes to be made a Justice of the Peace," and that he really is "a first-rate fellow," having "worked for us so very hard." Then the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0336"/>
<col>665</col>
Member of Parliament comes into play, and I wish to say that some Members have, to my knowledge, done their best to frustrate the system I am attacking; but the opportunity for so doing is seldom given, and the result is that upon the word of the party agent the Member of Parliament has to appeal to the Lord Chancellor and say, "I ask you, on behalf of my local party interests, to appoint this man; if you do not, I may lose my seat."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01290">My noble and learned friends Lord Halsbury and the Lord Chancellor could tell the House of the difficulties in the situation. I have only heard of the difficulties that are encountered. But I know that the late Lord Herschell and also Lord Halsbury and the present Lord Chancellor have, in taking the course which they considered best in the public interest, been censured and criticised by their political friends because it was said they had not done enough in the interests of their Party. Is this a satisfactory state of things? Year by year we are adding to the responsibilities and duties of the Justices, and year by year I am afraid the political influence in their appointment is increasing and the proper qualifications lost sight of. When I say that I mean that the influence is increasing amongst those who originate these nominations; I do not for a moment say that the influence is not discounted by those who have to make the ultimate choice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01291">The importance of maintaining a high standard on the Bench is clear to anyone who has had to deal practically with this subject. If you continue to appoint men insufficient to the discharge of the duties of the office you lower the standard of the magisterial Bench. As has often been said, the strength of the law lies in the respect in which it is holden, and the strength of the administration of the law lies in the respect in which the administrators are held. When I endeavoured to search out suitable men to go upon the Bench I constantly received the reply from the individual to whom I offered the position that he would be glad to be made a county Justice but that he would not sit upon the borough Bench because in that case he would have to occupy a position side by side with men totally unfit to discharge the duty of the office. The standard and sufficiency of many borough Benches in this county has been falling
<col>666</col>
lower and lower owing to the present system of selection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01292">A word or two in respect of the selection of county Justices. I approach the question of the county Justices in a somewhat different spirit. There is some little misunderstanding of the relative position of a Lord Lieutenant and the Lord Chancellor. I do not know how better to define the exact position occupied by Lords Lieutenant and the Lord Chancellor than by quoting a definition which was given in your Lordships' House in 1836. In that concise language which that great man who was then the Leader of the Opposition, the Duke of Wellington, so often employed, he defined the position in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"I know, and I believe that the Lords Lieutenant in general know, that the right to appoint the magistrates is exclusively in the hands of the person holding the Great Seal. Courtesy and custom have enabled the Lords Lieutenant to recommend to the person holding the Great Seal the names of gentlemen who were to be magistrates."</quote>
That, I believe, is the exact relative position. Whilst a Lord Lieutenant has power to recommend I take it that cannot be the exclusive right to recommend. I know that many think it would be objectionable that they should have competition in recommendation, but at any rate the House of Commons has decided that matter so far as a Resolution of the House of Commons can decide it, because in the year 1893 a Resolution was passed that&#x2014;
<quote>"In the opinion of this House it is expedient that the appointment of county magistrates should no longer be made by the Lord Chancellor for the time being only on the recommendation of Lords Lieutenant."</quote>
I believe great smoothness of action has taken place. Great consideration and a great desire to avoid friction have been shown by different Lords Lieutenant, and they have been met by the Lord Chancellor of the day, who has done his best to act as far as possible upon the recommendation, but not upon the exclusive recommendation of the Lords Lieutenant. If the exclusive recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant were acted upon it would make Lords Lieutenant responsible for every appointment. That is not the case. The Crown makes the appointment and the Lord Chancellor is responsible for the due exercise of the Crown's power. Therefore it is the Lord Chancellor's duty primarily
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0337"/>
<col>667</col>
to secure that a sufficient number of Justices are appointed and that they shall be sufficient also in capacity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01293">But let us consider the duty cast upon the Lord Chancellor. There are nearly 21,000 Justices of the Peace in England and Wales and 3,000 commissions of the peace. The Lord Chancellor has to make inquiries such as he can and see that the necessities of each community in each petty sessional division, are met, and that there is a sufficiency of qualified Justices. Apart from the political question in the nomination of Justices, surely there is something to be said in favour of assisting the Lord Chancellor in the exercise of this important duty. There are two important points to bear in mind&#x2014;first, to remove the selection of Justices from the area of political qualifications&#x2014;that is the first demand that I think a citizen of this country has a right to make&#x2014;and, in the second place, to find some method by which the Lord Chancellor should receive assistance in selection aiding his knowledge, which is not local, and bringing to bear upon it an impartial and unaffected judgment. If I am asked for my remedy, I reply that it is an impartial inquiry. If these evils do exist, is it not our duty to see if some remedy cannot be found for them? I therefore venture, with great respect, to commend this Motion to your Lordships' consideration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01294">Moved, That a Select Committee be appointed to consider and report whether any and what steps should be taken to facilitate the selection of the most suitable persons to be Justices of the Peace irrespective of creed and political opinion.&#x2014;(<i>Lord James of Hereford</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01295"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not had the advantage of hearing every word that my noble and learned friend said because he addressed himself to a more attractive portion of the House; but I think your Lordships may consider it convenient that I should say at this stage what I desire to say upon this subject, and if any question arises, anything in the nature of a complaint, I am quite certain your Lordships will allow me afterwards to give any explanation that may be necessary.<lb/>
But I have not heard from my noble and learned friend, so far as I did hear what he said, any serious charge. I have myself
<col>668</col>
desired an inquiry into this subject for upwards of two years, and my noble friend Lord James of Hereford has repeatedly suggested to me his desire for an inquiry on the grounds which I imagine he has stated to-night. I have dissuaded him more than once because, to begin with, I wanted a more full and ripe experience myself of what the true meaning is of this business of appointing Justices, and in the second place I hoped from what I heard that there was some intention of bringing this subject before the House of Commons &#x2014;a thing I should have gladly welcomed because I think it would have tended to create a more wholesome and honest view on this subject than I am sorry to say has always prevailed in the country, and I know of no place in which jobbery and humbug in general has shorter life or shorter shrift than on the floor of the House of Commons. But having become conversant with these matters, and since no step seems likely to be taken, I think it would be wrong to postpone an inquiry of the fullest kind any longer.<lb/>
I do not think that a Select Committee of either House is the best tribunal for this inquiry. If it was a Select Committee of this House they might be supposed to be influenced by one set of views; if it was a Select Committee of the other House the same thing might be suspected by the jealous critics who interest themselves in these matters. But I am able to tell your Lordships that the King has consented to the appointment of a Royal Commission for the purpose of investigating this subject in the sense in which my noble friend advocates that it should be investigated; that is to say, with a view of ascertaining how far you can get rid of those baneful elements in the appointment of Justices of the Peace to which he has referred.<lb/>
It is necessary, however, I think, that I should say a few words, and they will be said quite dispassionately, with regard to my reasons for thinking that an inquiry is desirable. What is the position and what are the duties of Justices of the Peace? My Lords, they are the Judges of the poorer classes in this country. Those who can afford expensive litigation may go to the Courts of law; those who have large sums at stake may find their way to this House; but common justice among the poor is administered by the Justices of the Peace of England and Wales. Nearly
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0338"/>
<col>669</col>
every criminal case that is tried, from the smallest offence to the crime of murder, at one time or another, at one stage or another, comes before Justices of the Peace. They also try very heavy and important cases at Quarter Sessions. They have administrative duties of the utmost importance&#x2014;the duty of licensing, than which few things can be more important&#x2014;together with multifarious other burdens imposed on them by different Acts of Parliament.<lb/>
Now, how should these places be filled in a system which is so useful and characteristic as this system of Justices in England? My Lords, what we should all desire to see would be that the best men should be selected without regard to anything else except that they are the best men to discharge the duties. Also we should desire to see&#x2014;and one ought to dwell on that&#x2014;that where there is a choice, as, indeed, there is in many, many cases&#x2014;the selection among those who are suitable should be so made that no class, and no creed, and no party could complain that they were excluded by reason of their opinions, political or religious. I believe that is what we should all like to see.<lb/>
I have to tell your Lordships that there are very great difficulties under the present system in accomplishing that which we all desire. I believe that no one except those who have held the place I now hold can have the intimate knowledge that is acquired in an office of that nature of the difficulties of the task, and that is, to my mind, one of the most unfortunate parts of the whole thing. Every one looks at his own corner. He looks at his own county, possibly at his own parish, and sees some gentleman whom he thinks eminently fitted for the place or who has given him assistance in his political aspirations, and who, he thinks, ought to be appointed. It is characteristic of human nature, and many people who hold that view seem perfectly unaware that any other part of England has to be considered, or that there are any other duties appertaining to the Lord Chancellor than, omitting all other considerations, to do the thing alone that would satisfy them and gratify their political friends.<lb/>
My noble and learned friend has stated that the responsibility of these appointments is with the Lord Chancellor. That
<col>670</col>
means to say that he is answerable if anything goes wrong, and he must, indeed, be a very tame-spirited person if he accepts responsibility if anything goes wrong without having had his say as to what is to be done in the discharge of that duty. There are about 220 separate Benches in boroughs alone that I have to fill up. There is no one to advise me or to give assistance of any sort, kind, or description. There is no Lord Lieutenant in any borough. How am I to make the choice in these 220 different boroughs? Personal knowledge I can have none, nor can any Lord Chancellor have it, and through this open gap&#x2014;open because there are no resources to obtain the proper and necessary information&#x2014;party claims on both sides are thrust forward, constantly with clamour and sometimes with menace, which, I need hardly tell your Lordships, is resisted with the contempt it deserves. This is on both sides of politics, and I do not think there is a pin to choose between one and the other. The consequence is that men of the highest qualities, who are not immersed in politics and whose assistance every one would desire, are liable to be overlooked&#x2014;a circumstance of not small importance in this connection.<lb/>
In addition to the 220 boroughs there are eighty-five counties. It would be a very great mistake to suppose that they are all, so to speak, under one blanket. The Lord Lieutenant, by custom, is associated with the Lord Chancellor in regard to each county. I have met and had interviews with a great many Lords Lieutenant; I have had correspondence with nearly all, and I have had communications with every one of them. In a few happy cases there has been nothing but formal communications; but I have had some opportunity of knowing&#x2014;I do not in the least know whether what I say will be credited, but the truth is that the Lords Lieutenant, with hardly an exception, are as anxious as I am to prevent purely partisan appointments to the Bench. That is true. But they have great difficulties, although I congratulate them on the circumstance that they are on a smaller scale than mine.<lb/>
When I came first into office I found that in some counties the Bench was almost entirely Conservative. I do not in the least suggest any blame to my predecessor the noble Earl who preceded me in the office. I believe that he followed the principle adopted by most Chancellors of leaving
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0339"/>
<col>671</col>
entirely in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant the appointment of Justices of the Peace in each county. That was the common practice. I do not believe that the Lords Lieutenant intended any such result; but they naturally consulted and acted upon the advice of others, and those who advised them were nearly always on one side of politics, and nearly all, socially, of one class. It was natural on the part of those who so advised the Lords Lieutenant to prefer persons of their own social rank and members of their own party holding their own opinions. They had no responsibility. The further you get away from the fountain source the less the responsibility. I do not believe for a moment that there was any design to exclude one political party. I am quite sure there was not. Many of the Lords Lieutenant discussed it with me, and I am certain that neither they nor in all cases those who advised them designed it; but while all the appointments were made in that way, from one quarter and one set of opinions, the result was what I have described. Thus in many places there arose very real grounds for dissatisfaction, together with a sense of indignity towards Liberals which no man of spirit would submit to.<lb/>
Now I am glad to say that the result of my communications with the different Lords Lieutenant has been that in almost every county of England, Scotland, and Wales the Lords Lieutenant and I have agreed with regard to the appointment of all the magistrates who have been appointed. That has been done not without a good deal of labour and effort, but with a very real, genuine wish on both sides to arrive at the best result. There is hardly a county in England, Scotland, and Wales in which these magistrates have not been appointed as the result of communications and agreement between the Lords Lieutenant and myself. I have received great assistance from them, for which I desire to thank them. Our object&#x2014;or, at least, I know my object&#x2014;has been to redress the real causes of complaint and to discountenance the doctrine that the Bench is to be the reward of political service. The discrimination in itself was a very difficult thing. It is very difficult to select, and the volume of the work is enormous.<lb/>
Appointments have been made in, I believe, every one of the 220 boroughs and eighty-five counties. Not only so, but the
<col>672</col>
counties are divided into petty sessional divisions, and you have not merely to see that each county has its proper number of magistrates, but that a sufficient number are distributed all over the petty sessional divisions, which very much enlarges and increases the work. During the three years 1906&#x2013;7&#x2013;8, when nearly 6,000 magistrates were appointed, I reckon that about 20,000 applications were considered and refused. I try to satisfy myself in the case of each list as well as I can, but minute inquiry is impossible&#x2014;from the volume of the work obviously impossible&#x2014;and therefore you must work with a rough axe. It is very difficult from the very nature of the business to say that in every case the right choice has been made, and under the present system, as under the present spirit, if any wrong choice is made one is perfectly certain to hear of it from more quarters than one.<lb/>
I ought to say now that, although the mass of the work is full of difficulty, the greatest embarrassment of all is this, that the work has to be carried on in an atmosphere of unceasing political jealousy not without an admixture of sectarian jealousy. The position of Justice of the Peace is an object of ambition naturally, the crown of an honourable career, but unfortunately for many years past both Parties in the State&#x2014;and there is no distinction between them&#x2014;have gradually come to regard the position as one which ought to be obtained by political interest and connection. This is the gravest, the most insidious, and the most widespread of the dangers which beset this subject. No one will openly avow that these appointments ought to be made in this way, or that it ought to be in the power of any one by political pressure upon Members of Parliament or upon Lords Lieutenant or upon Governments to select and enforce the choice of partisan Justices because they are party men. If that is to be done I prefer that it should be done by the open method of election, greatly as I detest the method of election for Judges of any kind, but it is better that it should be done in that way than attempted to be done by secret pressure.<lb/>
The chief thing to be done, in my humble opinion, is this, to extirpate the tradition that Party interest is the avenue to this distinction. It has grown up during a considerable number of years, and what we want to do is to get rid of it. If we do not
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0340"/>
<col>673</col>
succeed, if the principle I have spoken of is allowed to prevail, it will be the same as it is in the law of commerce, under which base coin drives out the sterling, and we shall find that the Benches will necessarily and naturally be degraded. I do not know what the opinion of the House of Commons may be upon this subject, but I have seen and spoken to scoresof Members of that House, and I must say I have found them as reasonable and as alive to the danger I have mentioned as any one of your Lordships can be&#x2014;I mean that I have found them so with a few exceptions, and those had better not be referred to. Nearly all of them desire to remove this whole question from the sphere of party politics. It must be&#x2014;I have not long left the House of Commons myself&#x2014;I should think, an unbearable nuisance to be perpetually solicited to advocate the claims of this or that gentleman. In any case, I am sure that to rescue these appointments from all elements of political interest or influence is in the public interest.<lb/>
My Lords, as to the remedy, that is what I hope the Royal Commission I will inquire into. My own belief is that it would be better not to displace either the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Lieutenant, but to provide some local machinery which should assist and advise them and enable them to carry out the spirit which I think and believe both sides of the House would be disposed to agree with. I have been anxious, as far as I can, to select the best men to fill places to which I attach the utmost importance. Now that I have announced that a Royal Commission is to be appointed, I hope my noble friend Lord James of Hereford will be willing to accept that, and not press for the Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01296"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have had some little experience as a borough magistrate, and I also had the honour of following Lord James of Hereford in the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and I am in that respect familiar with the mode in which appointments are made both in boroughs and in counties. I agree with almost every word that has been said by the two noble and learned Lords who have spoken, but I think they have taken rather too gloomy a view of the situation.<lb/>
<col>674</col>
In Wolverhampton the rule for many years has been that the city magistrates and the town council together appointed in equal numbers a committee, and that committee was in the habit&#x2014;I believe it continues so to this day&#x2014;of submitting the names which they thought most suitable to the Lord Lieutenant. My experience is that the Lord Lieutenant of the county&#x2014;Lord Dartmouth&#x2014;always carried out the recommendations put before him, and I believe that his appointments have given universal satisfaction. I do not say that system is one which could be generally established, but it has the element to which the Lord Chancellor has referred of introducing as far as possible, not election&#x2014;I think elected judges would be a curse&#x2014;but independent public opinion on the class of men who ought to be appointed.<lb/>
In the county of Lancaster while I was Chancellor it fell to my lot to appoint 544 magistrates. The difficulty there has in the past formed the subject of Parliamentary interference and voting in the House of Commons and considerable conflict as between the Chancellor of the Duchy and the Lord Lieutenant. But Lord James, when he was Chancellor of the Duchy, passed a Minute which introduced the Chancellor and the Lord Lieutenant, so to speak, to each other on practically equal terms, and when I followed him I adopted his rule and there never has been the slightest collision between the Chancellor and the Lord Lieutenant. The rule we adopted was that the Lord Lieutenant was to nominate and that the Chancellor should appoint, but the understanding that was between myself and the late Lord Derby &#x2014;and I believe it has been followed by our successors&#x2014;was that we would accept mutually each other's nominations. The Lord Lieutenant would nominate the men he thought fit and suitable, and I, as Chancellor, agreed to accept those nominations. If those nominations did not include the candidates who I thought should be put on, then I would send my list to the Lord Lieutenant, and unless there was some clear ground of objection, the arrangement would be carried out. That plan worked most admirably. There never was the slightest difference of opinion, except in a few cases, between Lord Derby and myself, and in those cases the differences were not political.<lb/>
I agree with Lord James that the first qualification should be character. I remember the late Lord Herschell telling me
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0341"/>
<col>675</col>
of a case in which a man was nominated with full political support behind him who had been convicted of a disgraceful offence before a Bench actually in the county from which the recommendation came. I do not wish the impression to go abroad that magistrates are unsatisfactorily appointed or are deficient. On the whole I believe magisterial duties in this country to be well discharged. The only danger is the political pressure which is brought to bear occasionally in favour of unsuitable men. It is undesirable that the Bench should have the reputation of being appointed on political grounds, sometimes in defiance of public opinion on the point. I hope the Royal Commission which the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has suggested will be able to find some solution of what is a grave and serious question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01297"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not certain that I have anything to add to what the noble Viscount has said. I must say I entirely sympathise with his view. I think both the noble and learned Lords who spoke before the noble Viscount a little exaggerated the difficulty of the evil. I do not think it is so great as has been suggested. I have had a good deal to do with magistrates. For thirteen years I was Chairman of Quarter Sessions and saw them in that aspect, and for seventeen years afterwards I had the duty to discharge which has been described by the Lord Chancellor of selecting Justices. I must say I have never had the smallest friction with any of the Lords Lieutenant.<lb/>
The title by which the Lord Lieutenant is more familiarly known has reference to his position in regard to the military services, but the real title he holds in connection with the recommendation of persons for the position of Justices is that of <i>custos rotulorum</i> and senior magistrate of the county. The moment we realise what his real function is the propriety of his recommending persons for appointment is obvious. He is the senior magistrate of the county, and as such has the responsibility of recommending, and does recommend, I think, with great fairness and with an entire desire to do justice. I agree that there is some difficulty in dealing with the larger counties where you have to provide for petty sessional divisions in every part; but I have always looked to the Lord Lieutenant
<col>676</col>
as being responsible for his recommendations. I was responsible for the appointment, but I had the Lord Lieutenant to look to as the proper person to make the recommendations. He was constantly associated with matters in the county, and knew both the necessities of the petty sessional divisions and the fitness of the persons whom he recommended.<lb/>
With regard to the other part of the question, I have often lamented during the years that I was entrusted with the duty of selection that there was no person in the position of the Lord Lieutenant who could recommend the magistrates in the boroughs. The Mayors, by the office which they hold, would presumably be the best fitted for this purpose; but I am bound to say I did not find that I received the same amount of assistance from the Mayors as I received from the Lords Lieutenant. Rightly or wrongly, the Mayors of the boroughs were generally found to be violent political partisans, and that presented a difficulty. My action in this matter has been subject of great animadversion, I believe principally on the part of those who were on my own side of politics. The difficulty of doing the best one could was great, but in that respect I received the greatest possible assistance from the Chairmen of Quarter Sessions. They were able to give me such information as would enable the exclusion to be made of persons who ought not to be appointed.<lb/>
One of the questions that was frequently pressed upon me was the appointment of working men to the Bench. I did appoint more than one working man. But, in my opinion, the real working man has no time to devote to the duties, even supposing that he were well enough educated and possessed commonsense, as a good many of them do. Certainly he is not in the position in which he can claim that his time is his own. I do not desire to enlarge more upon the subject, but my view is that, speaking generally, there has been a great deal of exaggeration in this matter. I believe that the present system has worked extremely well in the counties, and I can honestly say that I never discovered any tendency to make partisan appointments on the part of Lords Lieutenant. At the same time I would be glad to see some mode adopted by which the facts should be ascertained, and I hope
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0342"/>
<col>677</col>
that the future system, whatever it is, will be as perfect as my noble and learned friends wish it to be. On that subject however, I entertain considerable doubts owing to the difficulties which are inherent in its regulation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01298"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether it would be presumptuous on my part to say a few words in this debate, but as a Lord Lieutenant to whom reference has been made I should like to express my own individual views, and to say how heartily I approve of the proposal that the whole of this question should be inquired into by a Royal Commission. No doubt the removal of the property qualification has added very greatly to the difficulties. There can be no doubt that the great majority of existing magistrates are on one side of politics&#x2014;due largely, I think, to the existence in years gone by of the property qualification and the fact that men possessing the necessary experience were to be found chiefly on one side of politics. It is not an easy matter to overcome these difficulties. I have in mind a Bench in my own county, which at one period was presided over by a magistrate of strong Liberal tendencies. When the question of the political disproportion of magistrates arose acutely I naturally looked to this Bench in view of the fact that I had never made any recommendations without the approval of the Chairman of the Bench, and without asking him whether he had anyone whose name he would wish to bring before me&#x2014;I naturally looked, as I say, to this Bench as one that I should be able to present to the Lord Chancellor as an ideal Bench from this point of view, but my surprise was great when I found that only one Liberal sat on that Bench. No doubt it is most important that these appointments should be removed from the area of political influence.<lb/>
Lord James set out a very excellent ideal of what Justices of the Peace ought to be, and he suggested that they should be sufficient in numbers and efficient in quality. One of the great difficulties we have now is that a great many of those who are brought under our notice for recommendation are, on inquiry, discovered not to possess the necessary qualities, and when their names are not submitted it is invariably attributed to Party bias. It is highly necessary to examine recommenda-
<col>678</col>
tions in order to find out who are the men best fitted to fill the appointments on the Bench. I think it would be a great advantage that the Lords Lieutenant should have the support that would be given to them by the recommendations of a Royal Commission. I can assure your Lordships that the Lords Lieutenant who have the responsibility of recommending magistrates take every possible care to see that the men who are appointed are worthy of the position. I am certain that under no system will it be possible to satisfy everybody, and I think that what we have been able to do is the next best thing to that, for we have been able to give complete satisfaction to none. I hope that the proposal submitted by the Lord Chancellor will give general satisfaction, and that the outcome will be to strengthen the hands of Lords Lieutenant.</membercontribution></p>

Why? The reason was that these modest-looking taxes involved a principle capable of far-reaching application, a principle which they believed to be sound and safe, but which the great bulk of their political opponents equally strongly denied. What was that principle? It was this, that the land of the country, the land as distinct from the buildings erected upon it, the land as distinct from the improvements made upon it, in truth belonged to the nation. And if this were so, then the nation was entitled to appropriate for public purposes a portion of the value of the land.

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01336"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have given private notice to the noble Earl that I would ask him this evening whether he could give any information as to the course of business in this House during the next few weeks. I think with that limitation as to time the question is not an unreasonable one. Of course, if I were to interrogate the noble Earl as to remoter possibilities he would probably meet me with a <i>non possumus</i>; but there are certain measures in which the House takes an interest as to which I think he will probably be able to give us at any rate some information. He has announced the date upon which he will take the Union of South Africa Bill. Upon that point, therefore, we are informed. But there are one or two Bills of importance, such as the Labour Exchanges Bill and the London Elections Bill, which, I fancy, are pretty well advanced in another place. Besides that, there are two Bills of really first-rate importance which in ordinary sessions would be regarded as the main measures of the year &#x2014;the Housing and Town Planning Bill and the Irish Land Bill. It would be most convenient, I am sure, to the whole House if we could form any idea whether these Bills are likely to come to us in what I may describe as the near future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01337"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Marquess for having given me notice of this Question. It is quite true that as far as regards what we may call the ultimate course of the session, I am not in a position to say anything definite. Indeed, if the noble Marquess had put a question to me on that subject I should have been almost disposed to reply not perhaps with a <i>non possumus</i> so much as by asking him in turn whether he could give me any information on that subject, because he knows at any rate as much about it as I do. With regard to more immediate business, assuming the South Africa Bill takes only one evening, it is proposed to take the Second Reading of the Trade Boards Bill on the following evening, the 28th. It is hoped that this Bill and the Assurance Companies Bill will have passed through all their stages by August 5. Then there is the Appropriation Bill, which ought, I think, to reach this House by August 10. That, of course, is a somewhat formal matter, unless your Lordships desire to raise any discussion upon it, and therefore that, perhaps, need
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0346"/>
<col>685</col>
not be taken into special consideration. The Labour Exchanges Bill ought to reach this House by July 30, and it might, I think, be possible to take at any rate the Second Reading of that Bill before August 5, which is the date on which it seems possible that we might adjourn for a short time. I should propose that we should adjourn on the 5th until the 12th, for the Appropriation Bill, and that from that time onwards, in the absence of any business coming from another place, we should adjourn for a week at a time. I do not think it would be advisable to attempt any long formal adjournment because, as your Lordships know, once the House is adjourned there is no possibility, however urgent business may be, of causing it to meet. Therefore I suggest that we should formally adjourn for a week at a time. As regards the Housing and Town Planning Bill and the Irish Land Bill, I think there is no prospect of either of those measures appearing here before August 23. Therefore I think we may safely assume that no business of importance at any rate will reach this House before that date.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE LORD ADVOCATE AND LAND<lb/> TAXATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01338"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl the Leader of the House knows that, through no fault of my own, I was precluded from getting an answer to a simple question which I had on the Paper yesterday. The noble Earl sent me a most courteous message asking whether would postpone the question until this hour to-day. In order to do that I was technically obliged to take the question off the Paper altogether, because if it appeared on the Paper I could not bring it on at this moment. I understand from the noble Earl that it is convenient for him to give me an answer now, and therefore, with the indulgence of the House, I would call attention to the speech of the Lord Advocate at Armadale on June 2, when he was reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Chancellor of the Exchequer had made but a very modest estimate of their yield, only some&#x00A3;500,000, yet of all his proposals they would find that the land taxes would be the most keenly&#x2014;indeed, savagely&#x2014;fought. Why? The reason was that these modest-looking taxes involved a principle capable of far-reaching application, a principle which they believed to be sound and safe, but which the great bulk of their political opponents equally strongly denied. What was that principle?
<col>686</col>
It was this, that the land of the country, the land as distinct from the buildings erected upon it, the land as distinct from the improvements made upon it, in truth belonged to the nation. And if this were so, then the nation was entitled to appropriate for public purposes a portion of the value of the land. This the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to do."</quote>
It is not my intention to make a speech and I do not wish to comment upon the private opinions of members of the Government, because I know there is a large amount of latitude allowed; but the Lord Advocate announced the opinions of the Government, and I think we are entitled to be informed whether the opinions of His Majesty's Government are correctly represented by the Lord Advocate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01339"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise both to the noble Lord and to the House for not having been in my place yesterday to answer this Question when it was on the Paper, but I was detained elsewhere by very important business connected with the South Africa Bill and it was not possible for me to get down to the House. I am obliged to the noble Lord for having postponed this Question at my request. In answering it now, I shall be enabled, I hope, to clear up some misapprehension which apparently exists.<lb/>
I understand that the noble Lord is afraid that certain provisions forming part of the Finance Bill are not introduced, strictly speaking, as part of that Bill, but for different reasons. Now, my Lords, the case with regard to this Finance Bill, or any Finance Bill, appears to me to be this&#x2014;that a Finance Bill is confined to the raising of revenue and to the establishment of such machinery as is necessary for the raising of the revenue either in the particular year, or in future years if any Government should desire to continue to raise revenue in a similar way. That I take to be an indisputable fact; but it does not necessarily preclude either a Minister or other persons from suggesting other considerations which, in their opinion, make the imposition of a particular tax desirable.<lb/>
Take an instance in which I know I shall have the sympathy of the noble Lord. Supposing that in the Finance Bill it was proposed to impose a 5<i>s</i>. tax upon corn. It
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0347"/>
<col>687</col>
would be open, I think, to anybody&#x2014;a member of the Government or anybody else &#x2014;to say that in his opinion one great advantage of such a tax was not merely the revenue it produced, but the fact that by raising the price of corn all over the country it would encourage the agricultural industry in certain districts and help to retain the people on the land. That is an argument which, at any rate, might be used in districts where wheat is grown, though in large urban centres a different class of argument would probably have to be employed. That appears to me to represent a rough analogy to what has occurred in the present case, in the speech of the Lord Advocate.<lb/>
When the noble Lord asks me what the opinions of the Government are in regard to the academic proposition that "land as distinct from the buildings erected upon it" and the rest of the quotation belongs to the nation, I may frankly tell your Lordships I have no idea. So far as I am aware that abstract question has never been the subject of discussion by His Majesty's Government. The noble Lord has himself been a member of a Government, and he knows very well that the time which it is possible to set apart for abstract discussions, either economic or metaphysical, is extremely limited, if, indeed, it can be said to exist at all. I am bound to say that this particular question has never been before us, and therefore I am not in a position to reply to that part of the noble Lord's Question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01340"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Then the Lord Advocate was premature in his announcement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01341"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I have no right to speak and can only say a word with the indulgence of the House. The noble Earl, no doubt, observed that in the passage quoted the Lord Advocate referred to a principle which "they"&#x2014;that is, His Majesty's Government&#x2014;believed to be sound and safe, that principle being that the land as distinct from the improvements made upon it in truth belonged to the nation. What we want to know is whether, when the Lord Advocate attributed those opinions to the Government, he was speaking with their concurrence and approval, or only for himself?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01347">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01348"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved an Amendment postponing the date at which the Bill should come into operation from January 1, 1910, to May 28, 1910. The object, he said, was to give more time to the local authorities and other persons interested in the measure to arrange the preliminaries that were necessary before the Bill came into operation.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01350"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member> said that the licences under the Act were annual, and they would expire on May 28 each year. It was not intended that the licences should run from an earlier date than May 28, though it had been thought desirable to bring the Bill into force on January 1. The object here aimed at was to enable preparations to be made so that the licences might be issued in due course in May.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01351"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member>referred to a custom in the south-west of Scotland, mainly in Ayrshire, where the dairy industry was largely maintained, whereby landlord and tenants made bargains that farms should be carried on for dairying purposes, the landlord to carry out repairs. A tenant bound to carry on his farm as a dairy farm might find the local authority intervening and saying that the buildings were not sufficient. The tenant could not be expected to put up new buildings if there were only a few years of the lease to run. Thus it might take a little time to bring the measure into operation without difficulty and friction if the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0348"/>
<col>689</col>
interests of two or three parties had to be consulted and adjusted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01352"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said the Government thought that the five months which would elapse between January 1 and May 28 was a long enough period, but if it should appear that a longer time was necessary he would be prepared to consider whether or not a prolongation of the period should be granted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01353"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> asked, with regard to Lord Clinton's Amendment, whether the Secretary for Scotland would add the words to make the point clear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01354"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said he would consider whether any additional words could be put in. But in any case the noble Lord could take his assurance that it was the intention of the Government that should the Bill pass into law licences should not date from an earlier time than May 28.</p>

by omitting the words "from which milk is supplied," and inserting "from which milk is sold or supplied for sale." He said the object of the Amendment was to make it clear that the provisions of the clause applied only when people were selling milk for the purposes of trade.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01397">Clause 5:</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01398"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> moved to substitute a certificate of registration for a licence. He said that to make the carrying on of this business subject to annual licence seemed unduly harsh and liable to be perverted into an instrument of oppression. He quite agreed that the premises should be inspected, but thought that a certificate of registration would answer the purpose better than an annual licence. It was unfair, he thought, to keep those who were engaged in a perfectly legitimate business in a state of uncertainty. Once premises were registered they should not be interfered with without good cause shown. The Chamber of Agriculture in Scotland were inclined to press this point very strongly. It was no new one to them. This Bill was largely an adaptation of one which was introduced into the House of Commons last year by a private Member who had recently succeeded to a post in connection with the Government, and last year this provision was much animadverted upon and condemned by agriculturists all over Scotland.</p>

<quote>"In page 2, line 14, to leave out the word 'licensed,' and to insert the words 'given a certificate of registration.'" &#x2014; (<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01400"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said he would be only too willing to defer to the noble Lord's authority if it were not for certain circumstances which he thought had not been brought to the noble Lord's notice. In the first place, the Bill only proposed to continue a practice which had already been in operation throughout the burghs of Scotland. In the burghs these premises were licensed now. Slaughter-houses were regulated on the same system as it was now proposed to apply throughout Scotland to dairies&#x2014;a system of annual licensing and annual inspection. He did not think a system of annual licensing need be any more oppressive than the system which the noble Lord suggested.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01401"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> was not convinced by the arguments used by the noble Lord. He knew that local
<col>694</col>
authorities were not usually unreasonable, but if this power was given and an unreasonable local authority was to be in a position simply to sit still and decline to renew a licence, the farmer would be placed in a very difficult and unfair position. A slaughter-house presented no real analogy with a dairy. The noble Lord had not explained why the Bill for England should propose a system of registration and the one for Scotland should propose a system of licensing. He could assure the noble Lord that the injustice of this was felt very strongly in Scotland, and he had in his hand a protest from the Chamber of Agriculture in Edinburgh, of which for the current year he was president.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01402"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> supported the view taken by Lord Balfour. In the burghs the hardship was not so great, as the dairymen were on the spot and the procuring of a licence was not a serious matter; but in country districts dairymen might have to travel a long way to get the licence, which in itself would constitute a difficulty. He hoped that, on reconsideration, the Government would accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01403"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said he had mentioned burghs, not because the conditions were exactly similar, but because it seemed highly undesirable, if it could be avoided, that dairymen in burghs should be under one system and dairymen in the country under another; and their experience of the smooth and successful working of this system in the case of burghs supplied a <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case for extending it to the counties. The English Bill proceeded on different lines as it made general conditions throughout the whole country. He did not think there was much likelihood that local authorities in Scotland would act oppressively towards farmers in their districts. Moreover, in subsection (7), an appeal was provided for in such an event.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01404"><member>LORD LEITH OF FYVIE</member> said that the County Council of Aberdeenshire had appointed a committee to go into the matter. He had the committee's report in his hand, and although they did not propose to change the word "licence" for "certificate of registration," yet that was implied, because they suggested that the appeal should be to the Local Government Board and not to the sheriff.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01405"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said this was a point they could consider later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01406"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> intimated that he would support the noble Lord if he went to a Division. The local authority was to have the premises inspected every year by a medical officer and a veterinary inspector, and any defect would soon be brought to its notice. Surely registration with continual inspection constituted a sufficient guarantee. Further restrictions ought not to be imposed unless they were absolutely necessary.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01441"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said it would be deemed premises within the district to which the dairy belonged.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01442"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said the provision in the subsection was "be deemed premises within the district." That district, surely, was the district in which the milk was sold and not the district of origin.</p>

<quote>"It shall be the duty of every local authority, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, to make by-laws for their district providing&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) For the inspection of cattle in dairies;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) For prescribing and regulating the structure, lighting, ventilation (including air space), cleansing, drainage, and water supplies of dairies and their appurtenants;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) For securing the health of the cows and the cleanliness of the persons and clothing of those engaged in the business, and of the milk, cows, dairies, utensils, and vessels used for the reception, conveyance, storage, or sale of milk;</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) For prescribing precautions to be taken by dairymen against infection or contamination.</li></ol>
Such by-laws shall apply to all dairies whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, but by-laws under paragraph (<i>b</i>) of this subsection shall not be applicable to dairies where the dairyman sells milk only in small quantities to persons in his employment or to neighbours, and if any question shall arise as to whether a dairy comes within this provision, such question shall be determined by the Board, whose decision shall be final."</quote>
He proposed to insert, after the word "utensils" in paragraph (<i>c</i>), the word "vehicles," and to omit from the last paragraph the words "whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act." The proposed new by-laws would probably be more stringent than those already in existence. He had no objection to their applying to all dairies constructed after the passing of the Bill, but with regard to those now existing he thought it would be desirable to leave some discretion to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0354"/>
<col>701</col>
the local authority as to whether the new by-laws should be enforced or not. The by-laws might enact some new regulations as to cubic space, and so on, which, if applied to existing dairies, might work harshly. He therefore proposed that the local authority should have an option in applying the new by-laws to existing dairies. If a local authority were unduly lenient the Board would, under subsection (4), have an opportunity of stepping in and saying that the by-law must be enforced.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01458"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said he was advised, and he shared the view himself, that it would be undesirable to make this discrimination between old and new dairies. Moreover, it would be an invidious burden to lay upon the local authorities. Then there was the practical objection that in the administration of the Public Health Act it was not always easy to define a new dairy, and numerous administrative difficulties would arise if the noble Earl's Amendment was inserted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01459"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> thought that as there was to be a certificate of registration that would give the necessary protection, because if a dairy was to be interfered with it could only be on good cause shown.

milk was only one of the subjects on which the Bill proposed to give the Local Government Board power to make general orders, and until the form of those orders was seen he could not understand the noble Lord taking objection. He might add that the paragraph was taken from the English Bill, and that he had been urged to insert it in the Scottish Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01486"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member> said he had no doubt the noble Lord had been advised by his experts to insert some words of this kind; but would he give the Committee some idea of the particular danger the paragraph was intended to meet? Their Lordships were discussing the other evening the desirability of marking bags in which hops were packed in order to show the origin of the hops; but did circumstances ever arise in which it was desirable that the milk of a particular cow should be identified so that its origin could be traced? That was what this provision came to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01487"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said it was desirable that milk from a suspected cow should not be mixed with other milk. The section only gave power to the Local Government Board to make regulations on this as well as on other subjects; it was not enactment of itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01488"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> held that it was important that the paragraph should be retained, and that there should be power to prevent the mixing of milk from an infected cow or an infected dairy with fresh milk.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01489"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said the provision was intended to prevent not only infected or suspected milk being mixed with fresh milk, but to prevent stale milk in certain circumstances being mixed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01557"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> called attention to this clause, which provided that all expenses incurred by the local
<col>710</col>
authority for the purposes of this Act should be chargeable on the public health general assessment leviable under the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897. He asked what contribution the Government were going to make from the Exchequer towards the expenses of the Bill? As he pointed out on the Second Reading of the Bill, this clause introduced a very large and important subject. The Bill had to be taken in connection with the Order of the Board of Agriculture of May last. They had no power to limit the very large expense which would be placed upon the ratepayers by that Order, but this Bill was in their Lordships' hands and before they agreed to Clause 25 he thought they ought to be satisfied that the Government were going to make some considerable contribution towards the cost of carrying out these provisions. He contended that the purification of milk was a matter which concerned the whole country, and the cost ought to be borne by the taxpayers and not by the ratepayers. Perhaps the noble Lord would tell the Committee whether the Government had come to any conclusion with regard to this matter. Although their Lordships might approve of the provisions of this Bill, yet if nothing were done to assist the ratepayers they would have to consider whether it was really justifiable to impose such an enormous expense upon them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01558"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member> said that on the face of it everyone would be inclined to agree with Lord Camperdown, but it was a matter which required very careful consideration. If the English Bill did not become law the Order, as agreed with the Local Government Board, would not come into force in England. But if the English Bill became law the Order would apply to England, Scotland, and Wales. If the Scottish Bill only was passed then the Order would apply to Scotland only. In those circumstances the matter did require careful consideration, and he was not prepared to give an answer off-hand to the noble Earl's question. He was convinced that the noble Earl would be the last person to wish to create an <i>impasse</i>.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01559"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said it was true that he would be the last person to wish to create an <i>impasse</i>, but, at the same time, he had received no answer to his
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0359"/>
<col>711</col>
question. If their Lordships parted with Clause 25 without having an understanding with the Government the ratepayers would be liable for the whole of the expense. He wished to know what the Government proposed to do in the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01560"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> questioned whether their Lordships were not engaged in discussing a matter of privilege.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01561"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> pointed out that his noble friend Lord Camperdown asked this question on the 14th instant when the Bill was read a second time. Therefore the request for information on this point was not a surprise sprung upon His Majesty's Government. They had had some days in which to consider the question, and might, he thought, have been prepared with an answer. It would seriously affect the passage of the Bill if no answer was forth-coming.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01562"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said that if the noble Earl would defer his question and repeat it at a later stage he would endeavour to give him an answer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01563"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member> said the question raised by the noble Earl was a very important one. The Bill was a very stringent Bill, and would no doubt involve very large expenditure, which must fall on somebody's shoulders. His noble friend simply asked whether the whole of the expense would fall on the ratepayers or whether there was any prospect of their burden being alleviated. He hoped the noble Lord would be able to clear up the point on another occasion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01564"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that if he deferred his question it would be on the understanding that he would be allowed time to raise it on the Third Reading, if he was not satisfied with the Government's reply.</p>

<title>SUNDAY LABOUR IN THE MERCANTILE<lb/> MARINE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01605"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the question of the amount of unnecessary Sunday labour which is imposed upon the officers and men of British merchant ships when lying in seaports both at home and abroad, and to refer to certain comments of the noble Lord representing the Board of Trade when opposing a Motion on this question which was debated in your Lordships' House on November 30 of last year; to ask whether, since that date, the Board of Trade have placed themselves in communication with the representative shipowners' organisations in this country with a view to ameliorating this serious hardship and undue physical strain on our merchant seafarers; if so, whether they will lay the correspondence on the Table of the House; also, to move to resolve "That this House is of opinion that it is desirable that this question should receive the attention of His Majesty's Government in order that legislative measures may be introduced to deal with it."<lb/>
The amount of support and sympathy which certain of your Lordships were good enough to extend to me when dealing with this subject on a previous occasion encourages me in the hope that this time my effort may prove successful. I am renewing it because additional facts amply
<col>716</col>
justifying my doing so have come to my notice. Amongst others deeply interested, the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, which is the largest representative body of captains and officers in the world, has urged me to continue to press forward this urgent question of unnecessary Sunday labour in the mercantile marine. I do not for a moment propose that the restrictions I am asking for should apply to ships when they are at sea, but only when they are lying in ports both at home and abroad.<lb/>
I am anxious that the Government should act consistently in regard to this question of providing a day of rest for those who hitherto have seldom known what it means. In suggesting this consistency, I would draw your Lordships' attention to the statement of the Home Secretary in another place that, in conjunction with his colleagues, he had decided that effect could, and should, be given to the recommendations of the Committee which inquired into the question of a weekly rest day for the Metropolitan police; these recommendations they had decided to carry out as rapidly as practicable. Some fourteen or fifteen hundred additional constables would, he said, be required over and above the recruits normally needed each year to fill vacancies. The Home Secretary stated that it had, of course, been recognised that this privilege would throw considerable additional expense on the ratepayers of the Metropolitan Police District, but he hoped that the cost would be cheerfully borne.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I am urging the claims of a class of the community who, with due respect to the Police, are much more entitled to consideration and protection in respect to reasonable relaxation from their almost incessant and arduous work; and my suggestions can be adopted without entailing any cost whatever to the ratepayer. Some shipowners may object, but surely if other countries decline to allow unnecessary Sunday labour on their ships, there can be no ground for our shipowners complaining that forbidding Sunday labour exposes them to unfair competition from the foreigner. As it is at present the fair-minded and considerate shipowner who stops work on his ship when in port on the Sabbath has to meet with the unfair competition of the unscrupulous shipowner who does not. As competition has become
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0362"/>
<col>717</col>
fiercer and fiercer, the natural result is that Sunday labour is usually taken as a matter of course in ports abroad, whilst it is quite common in ports at home.<lb/>
What is the position of our merchant officers and men in respect to work on board ship? With the men, it means twelve hours on duty every day. With the officers, in the great majority of cases their daily hours of duty amount approximately to fourteen or fifteen, Saturday and Sunday being just the same as any other day at sea. Therefore, in all reason, I appeal to your Lordships whether, when a ship does arrive in port, these men have not an undeniable right to every possible consideration if the ship happens to be in port on a Sunday? As cargo is worked on Sunday by stevedores and men from ashore&#x2014;who, it may be remarked, demand and receive additional pay for it&#x2014;it is very frequently the case that our seamen are not required to work on Sunday. If they are, they demand extra pay, and get it, simply because they are in an independent position, and as a rule know that they will leave the ship at the end of the voyage. In the case of the officer, however, if cargo is working he must be on the spot the whole time, supervising and taking notes, and, with one or two exceptions, which prove the rule, he gets not a halfpenny additional pay for work on Sunday.<lb/>
When last year I introduced a Motion of this character I was astonished by a statement of the noble Lord who opposed me on behalf of the Board of Trade. He said that his information was that the articles of agreement which are signed by a ship's crew contain a stipulation that, in case Sunday labour is found necessary, a stated rate of extra pay, usually sixpence or eightpence per hour, should be allowed to the men. My noble friend the Earl of Meath thereupon interposed with the pertinent query, "What about the officers?" The noble Lord, in replying to this inquiry, stated that he understood that a similar arrangement was the rule with regard to officers. He did not say it was universal, but was informed that a similar arrangement was the rule, though, of course, the scale of extra remuneration in the case of officers was higher. Were this true the position would be much more equitable. I was not surprised to learn that this argument on the part of the noble Lord representing the Board of Trade
<col>718</col>
carried great weight, and I have no doubt it was greatly responsible for the nonsuccess of my Motion.<lb/>
In the first place let me inform your Lordships that in the usual articles of agreement which are signed there is no clause whatever relating to Sunday labour. Let me also assure you that where an officer is granted extra pay for Sunday labour in port it is one case in a thousand. I do not make this statement on my own responsibility only. I have been assured of its accuracy by Mr. Moore, the secretary of the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, who, representing, as he does, a vast number of officers of merchant ships, should surely know something about this subject. Then I have in my possession a number of very significant letters from members of the nautical profession which have been written since the previous debate took place in this House. They all deal with this question of Sunday labour. I have taken extracts from some of them which I propose to read; and I may say that all these writers hold similar views.<lb/>
I will quote from the letter of a merchant shipmaster of thirty years standing. He says, referring to Sunday labour, that with the exception of two months last summer when his ship was laid up in Calcutta, he could only recall a very few Sundays that he had had free. In all his experience he never knew a case of necessity for this Sunday work; it was always "a case of &#x00A3; s. d." He states that "Sunday night work and paying despatch money have grown ever since managers were paid on the gross earnings of the steamers." Another officer, who has had a good deal of experience in service on British vessels in the East, says that the question is one of great importance, and from his personal experience, extending over seven years, he verifies many of the statements I have made. He informs us of the fact that unless very big changes have been made Sunday labour is rampant on the Indian coast, and it is seldom that it is necessary except for the profit of the shipowner. He not only worked on more Sundays out there than he had free, but Bank Holidays, such as Christmas Day and New Year's Day, were never recognised. As to extra pay for this labour this officer says that the officers would have been considered mad to have asked for it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0363"/>
<col>719</col>
Another officer, mentioning three big steamship companies in which he has served for the past nine years, says he has never been paid a "red cent" for overtime work, including Sundays, Christmas Days, and other public holidays. As an instance he quotes his own experience where, in the space of the six months prior to the date of his letter, officers have had one Sunday to themselves, and that was because the naval authorities at a port abroad would not allow their crane to be used to discharge the cargo. He states, however, that this free Sunday was made up for by working from 6 a.m. on Monday to 2.30 a.m. on the following day, twenty and a-half hours without a stop. Another officer in a big steamship company writes&#x2014;
<quote>"Sunday work in port has been the rule and not the exception during my eight years experience in steam, and I never yet heard of officers or engineers getting overtime for it."</quote>
Another officer in a steamer writes from a port abroad&#x2014;
<quote>"To-day (Sunday) we have, of course, been working coals all day. See what good Christians we are!"</quote>
However, he supposes the men who allow them to work will be answerable, and not the officers. Another officer, writing from Valparaiso, says&#x2014;
<quote>"Lord Hamilton of Dalzell's statement in the House of Lords, that officers receive extra remuneration for work on Sundays in harbour unconnected with the safety and navigation of the ship, I contradict without qualification."</quote>
I will only read to your Lordships one more extract. It is from a communication I have in my possession from another shipmaster of very many years standing in the mercantile marine. He writes as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Regarding Sunday labour, my experience is that our men will not work on Sunday in port unless overtime is paid. But the officers do not get a cent. I question whether we could compel our men to do unnecessary work in port, but the firemen have to maintain steam while cargo is working at Philadelphia, which is done frequently. The shore labour Italians are paid overtime."</quote>
A Suez Canal pilot, who has much opportunity of observation, writes that he is very glad to find that this subject is being brought to the fore, and adds that it is a great pity that there was no one to correct there and then the misstatement of the Board of Trade representative in Parliament regarding extra Sunday pay for officers. I did at the time deny the accuracy of the statements regarding
<col>720</col>
extra pay for officers and the stipulation in the articles of agreement. I do not for one moment hold the noble Lord personally responsible for these misstatements. The information was placed in his hands by the Department he represents, and naturally he thought it was correct. But I think the Marine Department of the Board of Trade deserves censure for supplying such inaccurate and misleading information.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not bring this subject forward from a religious so much as from a humanitarian or utilitarian point of view. But I may say that divine worship in the merchant service would be a mockery under such conditions as exist, and who can wonder that it has become decadent? If we are honest in our desire to promote and foster worship of the Creator in the merchant service legislation on the lines of that adopted already by the leading maritime Powers will have to be carried out. The amount of daily labour which has to be performed by very many of our merchant officers and men is at times simply staggering. But it is not my wish to appear to overstate the subject; otherwise I could give more evidence in this direction. As I have previously informed your Lordships, practically all other leading maritime countries enforce limitations with regard to Sunday labour and hours of work of the officers and men of their merchant ships. It is we, professedly the greatest Christian maritime nation, who are the last to follow suit. It is truly an unedifying spectacle to find two merchant ships lying in port on Sunday, one a foreigner with all work shut down and the other a Britisher with work going on just the same as on a week day.<lb/>
So far as I can see there is only one objection&#x2014;if it can be called an objection &#x2014;and that is that cases are liable to arise where Sunday labour in port cannot be avoided. If other maritime countries find that this difficulty can be easily got over, surely it is not beyond our power to solve it also. If we are to be reasonable with shipowners, then it is our clear duty to be reasonable also with our officers and seamen. Personally, I would not have the remotest objection to saving clauses in a Bill which would permit of work on Sunday under certain very defined and necessary conditions, but with the proviso that such work should always command extra pay.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0364"/>
<col>721</col>
Your Lordships will observe that up to now I have confined myself to the Motion which I have brought before you. I would now draw your attention to a Question which I am also addressing regarding certain steps which, I understand, have been taken by the Board of Trade since I brought this matter forward last year. It is authoritatively stated in the Press that the Board, no doubt influenced by the result of the previous debate which I had the honour to initiate, have placed themselves in communication with the different shipowners' representative organisations on this question of Sunday labour, and that the shipowners have returned unfavourable replies. Now I think that, in the interests of our seafarers, and, indeed, in the public interest, these things should not be carried on secretly. If the Board of Trade have taken any such action, then it would strengthen their hands considerably did they acquaint the public of the nature of it, and also of the nature of the replies received. I hope, therefore, that this correspondence will be laid on the Table for the information of your Lordships so that we may know exactly what view British shipowners hold on this question.<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to put yourselves in the position of the men in whose cause I am appealing. I would ask you to imagine their feelings at being robbed of the one day's rest in seven which they should be able to command as their legitimate birthright. I would ask you to consider what it would mean had we ourselves to pursue our labours day after day, sometimes for months on end, without one single afternoon or one single day upon which we could claim the right to be free from duty, labour, and anxiety. We have in this matter a public duty to perform. The subject is one which strikes at the very heart of the religious convictions of our nation, and it is one in which reasons of humanity alone should make us take action. Your acceptance of this Motion would, my Lords, be a step from which, I can assure you, most beneficent results might arise, and one which would, once again, illustrate that your Lordships' House is ready to protect a class of the community who are voteless and are what may be termed "political outcasts," to whom is given no facility or opportunity of representation in the councils of our nation. I beg to move the Resolution standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<col>722</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01606"><i>Moved</i> to resolve, That this House is of opinion that it is desirable that the question of the amount of unnecessary Sunday labour which is imposed upon the officers and men of British merchant ships when lying in seaports both at home and abroad, should receive the attention of His Majesty's Government in order that legislative measures may be introduced to deal with it.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Muskerry</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01607"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Hamilton of Dalzell, who generally replies on behalf of the Board of Trade, is, I am sorry to say, too unwell to come to the House to-day. It has therefore devolved upon me to reply to the Motion of the noble Lord opposite. This question has been frequently discussed in your Lordships' House and was before you as lately as November 30 last, when my noble friend Lord Hamilton dealt with the subject. At that time the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, spoke upon the matter. He said he did not think it would be possible to introduce any useful legislation, but he suggested that the Board of Trade should communicate with the parties concerned and endeavour to come to some arrangement. The Board of Trade immediately acted on that suggestion, and the result is that we have received replies from the different shipowners and shipowners' associations on the subject. In reply to the request of the noble Lord, I may say that we shall be pleased to lay on the Table our letter to the shipowners and the replies received from them.<lb/>
The point with regard to Sunday labour is that it is very difficult to lay down what work is actually necessary and what a crew should do on a Sunday. I gather from my noble friend's remarks that he only wishes to limit Sunday work on ships to the time when they are actually in harbour, and he has quoted on that point the different laws in force in foreign countries. He quoted the case of France. If my memory serves me aright, in that country a day of rest is enforced by law, but the master of the ship has power to fix the particular day. That is the French idea. The letters that we have received from the different shipowners' associations are all very much against putting any actual binding contract into their agreements. The noble Lord asks us to bring in legislation dealing with the subject. The Government
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0365"/>
<col>723</col>
at present do not see their way to some clauses will be inserted with this introduce legislation on these lines.<lb/>
My noble friend stated that there was an excessive amount of Sunday labour in the mercantile marine. From that opinion I entirely dissent. I believe that the average shipowner does not insist upon his men working on Sunday if it can possibly be helped, and when they do work on Sunday I know that, as regards the men, all the big associations, such as the Liverpool Shipowners' Association, pay them overtime at the rate of 6d. or 8d. an hour. As regards the statement made by my noble friend Lord Hamilton of Dalzell that the officers are paid, my noble friend was in error in that. Officers are not paid for Sunday work. This, briefly, is the position of affairs at the present moment. While we all deeply sympathise with the noble Lord and are very much averse to Sunday labour, yet it is difficult to see what legislation could be usefully brought in; and for these reasons I am afraid that, as far as His Majesty's Government are concerned, they must ask your Lordships not to accept the Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01608"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the total abolition of Sunday labour while ships are in harbour would lead to a number of vessels being laid up, and this would involve interference with trade and increase unemployment. There is one class of Sunday labour which can scarcely be avoided in harbour. I refer to the number of small repairs that are constantly necessary. There are screws, nuts, and valves to be attended to, and it is almost impossible, for instance, to avoid working the engine room staff on Sundays when in harbour. But I claim that they have a right to extra pay for so doing. The noble Earl has told us that in many cases the seamen are able to insist upon extra pay for Sunday labour. Although it is too late to introduce a Bill this year, I hope that when the Mercantile Marine Act comes up for revision, clauses will be inserted making it compulsory to give extra pay to officers as well as men for Sunday labour, with the exception&#x2014;and here I disagree with my noble friend Lord Muskerry&#x2014;of the captain, because he very often has the opportunity of checking Sunday labour. This would act as a palliative and deter shipowners from employing their men unnecessarily on Sundays. I hope, therefore, that the next time a Merchant Shipping Bill is brought in
<col>724</col>
some clauses will be inserted with this object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01609"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ALBANS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take great interest in the subject which the noble Lord opposite has brought forward. I have lived most of my life at ports and in connection with seamen, and therefore the subject is one with which of necessity I have had something to do in former years. Whatever may be the result of this discussion, whether legislation is introduced hereafter or not, I cannot feel that a discussion of this kind in your Lordships' House is altogether thrown away. I believe that a great deal may be done by bringing public opinion to bear upon shipowners and all who are concerned in this matter, and I believe further that this reform will have to be a very gradual one. I am certain that it would be impossible to wholly stop Sunday labour throughout the mercantile marine, and I do not think anybody really seriously proposes that. What we do desire is that there should be an effort to reduce it to the smallest possible amount. It is not creditable that foreign countries should be able to introduce comparisons between British ships and their ships with reference to this matter, and if a comparison is now made it is not in favour of British ships. I think something should be done to try and remedy what is generally considered a serious grievance.<lb/>
There is a further point of view I should like to bring before you. My own experience of Indian ports is one of thirty or forty years ago, but for some time I lived at Calcutta and was more or less cognisant of the shipping there at that particular time. I had to do with a large number of seamen, and I have the keenest recollection, I am sorry to say, of a particular court in the Presidency jail which was entirely occupied by European seamen. When I acted for the chaplain I asked the men how they came there. In nearly every case it was owing to drink, and again and again the drink was the remedy, as they supposed, for the very hard kind of life they led; they took refuge in drink from the continual stringency of seven days labour. The point of view I want to bring out is that if seamen had more rational hours, if they had one day's rest in seven, I do not think there would be the same inducement to yield to this temptation. Therefore I venture to say that one rest day in seven would certainly
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0366"/>
<col>725</col>
conduce to the greater sobriety and temperance of the seamen of our mercantile marine. That is a point of view which I do not think ought to be left out of consideration.<lb/>
In the port of Karachi Sunday labour has been reduced to a minimum, and I do not see why what has been done at Karachi should not be done at Calcutta and other ports in the East. While I do not for one moment attempt to dictate or to say what ought to be done in reference to this matter, I do desire, if I can, to strengthen public opinion in the direction of reducing Sunday labour to the smallest amount; and I am sure that whatever may be the result of this discussion noble Lords on both sides of the House will desire that this object shall be attained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01610"><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I deeply regret to hear the decision that His Majesty's Government have come to. I cannot say I expected any other decision, but I hope the time will come when we shall hear from the Ministerial Bench that means have been found to put a stop to seven-day labour. All industrial occupations now, both in this country and abroad, are striving to minimise the amount of labour. I approach this subject, not from the religious point of view at all, but from the utilitarian. How is it that France is able to give one day's rest in the week, and we are not?<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke for His Majesty's Government said that they had carried out the desire which had been expressed from the Front Opposition Bench, that inquiries should be made to ascertain the views of those concerned. The noble Earl tells us that the Board of Trade applied to the shipowners. Are the shipowners the people who suffer? Is it the shipowners who have to work seven days in the week? I think not. It is the officers and sailors, and I should like to ask the representative of His Majesty's Government whether they have applied to the officers' organisations and to the sailors' and stokers' unions, because if they have not the answers they have received are worth nothing at all. I do not suppose for a moment that His Majesty's Government have any desire that sailors should be forced to work seven' days in the week. I cannot believe that they have, but from the answer that has been given to-night it would seem as if that were so.<lb/>
<col>726</col>
Each time this subject has been brought forward overwhelming sympathy has been forthcoming, but no action has been taken. On all hands we hear that we ought to do everything to encourage Britons to enter the British merchant service, and that it is a danger to the country that aliens should man the mercantile marine. Yet when we say that the sailor should be allowed what every other working man in the country has&#x2014;namely, one day's rest in seven&#x2014;we are told that it is impossible. I do not believe it. I believe that if His Majesty's Government chose to do this thing, it could be done, and I hope it will be done very quickly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01611"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is rather difficult for your Lordships to continue this discussion in the absence of the Papers which the noble Earl opposite has been good enough to promise shall be laid on the Table. When we receive them we shall see the fruit of the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn last year. The Papers are, I hope, full; that is to say, that the shipowners' answers are not merely expressions of opinion on their part that the proposed mitigations which have been urged are a mistake, but contain facts and arguments sufficient to satisfy your Lordships that such is the fact. The mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of the shipowners I do not think would be satisfactory.<lb/>
After all, we are face to face with this remarkable circumstance, that it has been found possible for other nations to proceed further in the direction of the mitigation of Sunday labour in their mercantile marine than we have, and in order to overset that example I think we shall look for something more than a mere assurance from the shipowners that any change in the present practice would be a mistake. I use the word "practice" on purpose, because I am not at all sure that it is a matter for legislation. I was struck by what fell from the right reverend Prelate just now when he urged that what was really required, apart from everything else, was a change in public opinion. No doubt that is the most important and the best method by which such an alteration can be carried into effect.<lb/>
It may be necessary for your Lordships to proceed further in this matter. Of that we shall judge when we see the Papers.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0367"/>
<col>727</col>
There is no doubt that <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> your Lordships would desire to see the same practice extended to the merchant service which belongs to every other trade and profession throughout the country. Therefore we are grateful to the Government for their promise to lay these Papers, and probably in these circumstances my noble friend will not desire to press the matter further until he sees the Papers. It will then be entirely open to him to bring the matter again before your Lordships in the event of his not being satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01612"><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has brought this question before the House appears to me to lose no opportunity of disparaging shipowners, and I am sorry, from the remarks which have followed from other noble Lords, that his statements to-night have been taken as facts. I entirely deny that Sunday labour on board British ships is carried on to such an extent as the noble Lord has insinuated. He has not brought any facts forward to prove his statement, and I emphatically deny that Sunday labour is common in home ports. Sunday labour on board British ships in home ports is the exception and not the rule. The noble Lord referred to shipping in the East. I admit I have no acquaintance with shipping in that part of the world and do not know whether his statements on that point are correct or not; but I felt that, as a shipowner, I could not allow his remarks to pass and the statement to be accepted that shipowners encouraged Sunday labour on every possible occasion. I know from my own experience that the contrary is the case. I desire, therefore, to protest against the view going forward that shipowners encourage Sunday labour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01613"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope you will allow me a few words in reply. The noble Lord who has just sat down stated that I had not brought any facts before your Lordships in support of the statements I had made. I can only read extracts from letters. This I have done, and I hold in my hand a letter, dated the 19th of this month, in which a captain mentions having passed a vessel lying in the Manchester Canal on which work was proceeding on a Sunday. It is not my own opinion that I voice on this question. I have stated the opinions of the captains and officers of our merchant service. They have no other means of putting forward
<col>728</col>
their views. I have a large bundle of letters here, and they are all to the effect that there is a large amount of unnecessary Sunday labour imposed upon the officers and men on British merchant ships. Most of it is at ports abroad, I admit, but home ports are also included. I have one letter in which the writer, alluding to my Motion which includes foreign seaports, says "We ought to look at our home ports first." I am sorry that the noble Lord who has just spoken thinks I have a bad opinion of our shipowners. I can assure him that that is not the case; but there are some shipowners, of course, who are not so good as others. After the remarks of the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench, and after the promise of the noble Earl to lay these Papers on the Table, I propose not to press my Motion. I will wait until the Papers are published; but I hope that when I bring this matter forward again, as I certainly shall, I shall meet with your Lordships' support.</membercontribution></p>

As your Lordships are aware, these mine-laying ships are of a comparatively new class, the first one having been completed as recently as the year 1907. These ships are generally employed under convoy, and at first it was not thought necessary to arm them. I may say, however, that the Admiralty are considering the whole matter anew, and perhaps at a future date my noble

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01621">[THE EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01622">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01623"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member> had given notice of an Amendment to add a new subsection&#x2014;namely:
<quote>"(9) This section shall come into operation at such time as may be fixed by Order in Council."</quote>
The noble and learned Lord said: This Amendment is one which, I think, depends entirely upon the result of the Amendment which follows, in the name of my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury; and if it meets with the view of the Committee I would prefer to postpone my Amendment and bring it up on Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01624"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> then moved to leave out Clause 1, which was as follows&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01625" align="center">"<i>Jurisdiction of Judges and Registrars of County Courts</i>.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01626">"1.&#x2014;(1) County Courts shall, save as hereinafter provided, have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action which can be commenced in the High Court, notwithstanding that the debt, demand, or damage claimed is not limited to one hundred pounds or under.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01627">"(2) Where an action is commenced in a County Court which could not but for this section have been so commenced except by agreement of the parties, the action shall, at the instance of the defendant or one of the defendants, be removed into the High Court within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by rules of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01628">"(3) Nothing in this section shall extend the jurisdiction of County Courts as respects any action of ejectment, or in which the title to any corporeal or incorporeal hereditaments or to any toll, fair, market, or franchise is in question, or for any libel or slander, or for seduction or breach of promise of marriage, or as respects any action on a judgment in the High Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01629">"(4) Nothing in this section shall extend the jurisdiction of County Courts as respects actions
<col>730</col>
for the time being assigned to the Chancery and Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Divisions of the High Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01630">"(5) Where, ill an action commenced in, or remitted to, a County Court, the defendant or one of the defendants counterclaims an amount of money not limited to one hundred pounds or under, and the plaintiff objects in writing in accordance with the provisions of Section 18 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1884, the whole proceeding shall, in accordance with rules of the Supreme Court, be removed to the High Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01631">"(6) Where any action or proceeding is, under this section, removed to the High Court, the record shall be transmitted by the registrar of the County Court to the proper officer of the High Court in manner prescribed by rules of the Supreme Court, and the action or proceeding shall thenceforth be continued and prosecuted in the High Court as if it had been originally commenced therein. The removal of any such action or proceeding shall not affect the validity of any order made or act done in the County Court prior to such removal, and any such order may be enforced by the High Court as if it had been originally made therein.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01632">"(7) Section 116 of the principal Act (which relates to costs in actions brought in the High Court which could have been commenced in a County Court) shall not apply to any action brought in the High Court which could have been commenced in a County Court by virtue of this section, but not otherwise.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01633">"(8) Section 64 of the principal Act, which confers jurisdiction on County Courts by agreement of the parties to an action, shall not apply in the case of any action which may be commenced in a County Court under this section."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01634">The noble and learned Earl said: My Lords, I move to leave out Clause 1 altogether. Before dealing with that question I wish to say a word, in passing, on the Amendment to which Lord Gorell has just referred. It seems to me that, although he has taken it off the Paper and reserved it for a later stage of the Bill, it will become very relative to the question we shall have to decide later on, because if there is one thing which I should think objectionable it would be that such an enormous change as this should be dependent upon some Government Department. The noble and learned Lord practically means that although he would agree to Clause 1, yet he would put it in the hands of the Government to allow it to be brought into operation if they thought proper. I can hardly imagine anything more unconstitutional. We are getting rather in the habit of giving power of legislation to Government Departments. My own impression is that it would be very difficult to discuss the question without discussing whether or not it should be in the power of anyone to determine what should be the course of the administration of justice in this country.</p>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0369"/>
<col>731</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01635">I must say I feel very strongly indeed upon the subject of this Bill, or, rather, upon the subject of Clause 1 of the Bill. That there are useful and possibly desirable enactments in other parts of the Bill I quite admit, but I am of opinion that a more portentous change in the administration of justice in this country than this clause introduces has never been suggested. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that for the first time we are instituting a system to which, as I hope I shall show presently, there are serious objections. At this moment I am only considering the mode in which this matter is brought forward. It is to be observed that there was a Committee appointed to consider the relations existing between the High Court of Justice and the County Courts and to report whether any and what alterations or modifications should be made in those relations and consequently in the jurisdiction and practice of the County Courts. That Committee&#x2014;over which my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell presided&#x2014;in a very distinct and decided manner, as I will show later, negatived the proposal contained in Clause 1. I do not exaggerate when I speak of the portentous character of the change proposed to be made. The Bar Council and the Northern Circuit have both signed protests against the system which is being suggested. One of the familiar observations made is that lawyers object to any amendment of the law. Indeed, I rather gathered from the observations made the other night by the Lord Chancellor that he suggested, in referring to a Motion brought forward by my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell, that all lawyers, of course, objected to any amendment of the law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01636"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: I do not think I said that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01637"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: At any rate, I can say that my withers are unwrung. I think it will be found that the amendments of the law which I have been instrumental in passing will bear comparison with any of those suggested by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. Therefore, my withers are unwrung on that subject. But I am really very much alarmed and distressed at the want of interest taken in such questions. Take this case. We have been building up a system of jurisprudence for many centuries which has been the subject of
<col>732</col>
eulogium on the part of every other country in the world. Now, without any notice to anyone and without any inquiry beyond that made by Lord Gorell's Committee, and which, as I say, is averse to this change, this proposal is brought forward for extending unlimited jurisdiction to County Courts in the administration of justice. I am sorry to say that no very great interest appears to be taken in the matter. The truth is that until you get the people to understand what is being done no interest is displayed. It is said to be a question for lawyers, and I am afraid no interest is taken in it, and it is not until it is too late that people begin to understand the serious invasion made upon their liberty. I will read to your Lordships the resolution passed at a special court of the Northern Circuit, held on the 19th instant in Liverpool&#x2014;
<quote>"The Circuit objects to the unlimited jurisdiction proposed to be conferred on the County Court. The Circuit considers the tribunal undesirable:
<ol>
<li>"(1) Because it is not in touch with the profession as a whole and has not the authority resulting from adequate professional and public criticism.</li>
<li>"(2) Because by its constitution, history, and experience it is unfitted to deal with cases of complexity and magnitude, and would not in such matters command public and professional confidence.</li>
<li>"(3) Because it is liable to be influenced by local and personal considerations."</li>
</ol></quote>
That is repeated by the Bar Council&#x2014;I do not mean in the exact words, but in substance the same objections are made; and it seems to me it is hardly possible to exaggerate in language the seriousness of the suggested change.<lb/>
Now, let me for a moment turn to the history of the County Courts, which were established for the purpose of enabling the easy recovery of small debts and demands in England and Wales. Their jurisdiction was limited to &#x00A3;20 in contract and &#x00A3;5 in tort. The mode in which those Courts were able to deal with cases quickly made them very popular, and the jurisdiction was afterwards extended. Lord Gorell's Committee, in their Report, give a list of the different jurisdictions that have been conferred on County Courts from time to time. In one sense it may be said that this shows how efficient they were, but the real truth is that when some new jurisdiction had been set up, and no particular mode for carrying it into execution had been suggested, the County Court has been the general refuge. It is set
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0370"/>
<col>733</col>
out in this list that jurisdiction has been conferred on the County Court, concurrent with the High Court, but unlimited, under&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Government Annuities Act, 1832. Recovery of fines under.</li>
<li>2. Poor Law Amendment Act, 1848. Recovery by guardians of amount of relief to poor.</li>
<li>3. Commons Act, 1876. To try questions of wrongful enclosure, encroachment.</li>
<li>4. Open Spaces Act, 1906. To sanction demises by trustees for this purpose.</li>
<li>5. Inclosures. etc., Expenses Act, 1868. Recovery of costs of Commissioners of Enfranchisement.</li>
<li>6. Extraordinary Tithe Redemption Act, 1886. Recovery of rentcharges.</li>
<li>7. Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884. Recovery of expenses incurred by candidate.</li>
<li>8. Married Women's Property Act, 1882. Any dispute between husband and wife as to the property of either may be tried, subject to certain powers of removal as of right into the High Court.</li>
<li>9. Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886. County Court Judge may appoint, may settle questions between guardians.</li>
<li>10. Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act, 1896. Powers of, transferred to County Court.</li>
</ol>
I will not weary your Lordships by reading this list any further; but all these important and onerous branches of work&#x2014;notably the jurisdiction under the Employers' Liability Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act&#x2014;of course multiply enormously the amount of business to be done. The result is that small Courts for the purpose of enabling poor people to have small questions settled are rendered absolutely impossible in some places. This no doubt inflicts great hardship on the poor; and I am sure the Lord Chancellor is the last person who would endeavour to oust the jurisdictions intended to render convenient and easy the administration of justice amongst the poor.<lb/>
The County Courts Committee stated that there appeared to them to be four suggestions which had to be considered with regard to this question. The first two were&#x2014;
<quote>"(1). That the County Courts should become part of the High Court, with unlimited jurisdiction in actions, but subject to a right on the part of a defendant to have any case in which the amount sought to be recovered should exceed a certain limit transferred to the superior branch of the High Court.</quote>
<quote>"(2). That the County Courts should remain with their present constitution, but should have unlimited, or at any rate much enlarged, jurisdiction in actions, subject to a right of transfer as aforesaid."</quote>
<col>734</col>
That is the very question we are discussing, and that was the question which my noble and learned friend sent to a Committee. Now let us see how the Committee answer it. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The County Courts, with the mass of small cases which are brought in them, must continue to dispose of the poor man's cases. This is their primary business, and the statistics above given show how as population increases the work of these Courts also increases, and may be expected to continue to increase. It is essential that that work should not be interfered with by attempts to deal to any serious extent with larger cases taking up much longer time in hearing, when the Courts which were originally constituted only as small debt Courts have already had added to their primary duties a quantity of other work and have their time practically fully taken up. As it is, the Committee understand that great inconvenience and waste of time and expense are occasioned by cases in which there is any lengthy contest, as the small debt cases must be disposed of at once, and parties in contested cases may or may not have their cases reached and disposed of on the day fixed, or may have costly and inconvenient adjournments."</quote>
The Committee also say&#x2014;
<quote>"It must be observed that the vast mass of the work of the County Courts has been, and is, the enforcing of the payment of small debts and claims; that no more work should be placed on these Courts which would interfere with their primary and most important duty; that almost all their work is in cases which are either without any defence or without any substantial defence, and that a very simple and inexpensive procedure, such as prevails in the County Courts, is absolutely necessary for such cases, whereas cases in which there is any real contest usually require procedure of a more formal character."</quote>
I must pause for a moment to observe the mode in which this case has been brought forward. I have no doubt it will be suggested by Lord Gorell, and perhaps by the Lord Chancellor himself, that this proposed change has been made dependent upon there being certain changes and improvements in the consideration of cases in the High Court. It is said by the Committee that if these changes are made you may afterwards make the changes proposed in regard to County Courts. Now, what has been done? My noble friend has brought in this Bill I venture to say, with all humility, without much consideration of what was going to be done, and now a Joint Committee has been appointed to take the other side of the question upon which this was to be dependent. What was the necessity for the extreme hurry to bring this forward? I am afraid I must here interpose an observation upon a subject which I have discussed with the noble and learned Lord opposite from time to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0371"/>
<col>735</col>
time. I have agreed with him that it is an undesirable thing to increase the number of Judges of the High Court. Well, but you have increased the jurisdiction of the High Court. You have thrown upon it the possible inquiry into every criminal case in the country. It may or may not have been wise that you should have done so. I confess I am still unconvinced, and I do not think the experience one has had since that Act was passed has made one think that the very important alteration in the law then made has been greatly to the advantage of the State.<lb/>
But be that as it may, the question now is, What are you to do? How can you escape appointing additional Judges when you have increased the jurisdiction to such an extent that three, and sometimes five, Judges sit from time to time to inquire into the most transparent and ridiculous cases of appeal that have ever been suggested. Of course, you have got congestion in the Courts. Judges are unable to do their work because you put upon them this extra labour which is absolutely unnecessary, certainly in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. The result is, as I say, that you have congestion. In order to get rid of this difficulty it is now sought to distribute the administration of justice all over the country by means of the County Courts. I know it will be said that there is this jurisdiction at present if both parties agree; but, if both parties agree, there is no difficulty at all in their applying and having their disputes settled by A.B. or C.D. If, however, they prefer a County Court they can go to a County Court. The question here is whether you are going to compel them. I am quite aware of the provision that if notice is given, if application is made to one of the Judges, the cases can be tried in a superior Court. One of the scandals complained of in this very Report is that these interlocutory applications are the occasion of much expense and annoyance, and have to a great extent blocked up the ordinary administration of the Courts. It seems to me that you are now doing that which this Report protests against as being one of the evils which have produced the present block.<lb/>
One of the great difficulties is this, that by this clause the number of County Court Judges will virtually be increased; that is, small cases will be sent to the Registrars, who were never intended to
<col>736</col>
be Judges. The poor man is to be relegated to an official whose education and business have not fitted him to take a judicial view of cases. I very much object to give such authority to anybody except those who both by education and practice have been accustomed to the administration of justice. The Bill that I introduced has been taken as an example, without sufficient consideration being given to what that Bill did. That Bill proposed that a certain number of Registrars, selected by the Lord Chancellor as fit for the purpose, should be allowed to issue writs and occupy the position of a Master. No such distinction is made in this Bill. The power is given to all Registrars of all County Courts; within certain limits they are the persons who will administer justice, and they are appointed, not by the Lord Chancellor, but by the County Court Judge himself.<lb/>
An extraordinary area of jurisdiction is given to the County Courts under this clause. The jurisdiction is unlimited, and a claim for, say, &#x00A3;10,000 may be entered in the County Court, and unless the defendant applies within a certain time and by notice&#x2014;again the interlocutory proceedings&#x2014;that must remain as a case to be decided in the County Court. Consider for a moment what becomes of the County Court in respect of the business for the discharge of which it was originally instituted. A case lasting a week is no novelty now, and undoubtedly the mode in which justice is administered&#x2014;I think rightly administered&#x2014;is calculated to increase the time occupied. At a time when the parties to an inquiry were not themselves admissible as witnesses it was very much a game of chess; the real persons who knew most about the matter were excluded. Happily the law has been so altered that the parties themselves can now be examined; but the inevitable result of that has been that no case is ever fought unless there is something to fight and something to be said on both sides. The result is that the time taken to try the case is increased.<lb/>
Then when you get to the County Court, consider the position. A County Court Judge has to deal with a number of small cases. The Report of Lord Gorell's Committee points out that where you have a large number of cases of any importance they occupy days, and one knows that what happens is this. The Judge cannot try them all, and cases have to go over to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0372"/>
<col>737</col>
another sitting. A case may be put off for hearing for a month. That is bad enough, but when that day comes round very likely one of the cases in the list is such that it lasts a day and a half, and it is impossible then to take the other case. I do say that in a great many cases this would amount to a denial of justice. The business of the High Court has increased enormously as the result of recent legislation. The Judges are insufficient in number to cope with the business, and in order to get rid of the business it is now proposed to tell suitors to go to the County Court. I sincerely hope that your Lordships will not permit so extraordinary a change in the law to take place, at least without some further consideration and inquiry than appear to have been given to the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01638">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out Clause 1."&#x2014; (<i>The Earl of Halsbury</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01639"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having been responsible for the Report, so far as I shared in it, of the Committee, perhaps I may be in a position to put before your Lordships some considerations which will show how that Report was arrived at, and what in substance is the object of the clause which this Amendment seeks to eliminate from the Bill. If the Amendment is accepted, there is no doubt that it will leave out a vary important part of the Bill, and there are certain clauses which depend upon the first clause and are intended to carry it out.<lb/>
Clause 1 as it stands does not really inaugurate any portentous change in the existing law. All it does is this. Whereas at present the parties to an action may agree that the County Court Judge shall have jurisdiction of an unlimited character, this clause simply allows the plaintiff to commence a case of a common law kind only in the County Court, and it gives the defendant the absolute right, without any application at all, to have the case tried in the High Court if the claim is over &#x00A3;100. It is not correct to suggest that any interlocutory application is required to carry that out. The words were carefully chosen&#x2014;
<quote>"the action shall, at the instance of the defendant or one of the defendants, be removed into the High Court within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by rules of the Supreme Court."</quote>
This clause, together with the rest of the matters which appear in the Bill, formed
<col>738</col>
the subject of inquiry, lasting a considerable time, by the Committee referred to, and with regard to this particular part eight members of the Committee were entirely in favour of it, one only being against it.<lb/>
The Committee consisted of nine members, and although it was a very small Committee it was representative of all those really likely to be able to give very full knowledge in dealing with such a matter as this. One member of the Committee was a High Court Judge who has a very large knowledge and experience of the Circuit business; another was a County Court Judge who has had very large experience of County Court work; a third was an ex-County Court Judge, who had also filled the office of Commissioner of Assize, and had, therefore, considerable experience of both branches; another was a Master of the Supreme Court; another a Registrar of the County Court who had filled the office of President of the Law Society; another was a solicitor who represented Lancashire opinion, which is so much interested in the progress of all improvements in the law; there was a representative of the Treasury to keep the Committee quite straight, if I may use the expression, in those matters which affect the Treasury, and another was a member of the Bar Council, who differed <i>toto c&#x0153;lo</i> from the Report.<lb/>
The Committee sent out inquiries to every Law Society in the country, to His Majesty's Judges, some of whom replied, to all the County Court Judges, and to some others. The result was a mass of replies, with which, together with such experience and information as the members had, this Report was framed. Although it was quite clear from the documents returned that there was considerable diversity of opinion on the questions put to the persons with whom communication was made, I think I am safe in saying that the largest and weightiest opinion was in favour of the extension of the jurisdiction of the County Court with an absolute right of removal. Some confined the extension to a limit of &#x00A3;500; some thought it should be unlimited; but all contained the suggestion that there should be a right of removal. It is not quite accurate to suggest that this is in any shape or form a new proposal. In 1872, when the Adjudicature Commissioners reported on this subject, they went a great deal further
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0373"/>
<col>739</col>
than this Report goes. They proposed that County Courts should be constituent parts or branches of the High Court of Justice. They also recommended that those Courts, as constituent parts or branches of the High Court, should, subject to the power of transfer, have jurisdiction unlimited, and that if the parties to a dispute were content that it should be decided in the County Court it should be dealt with accordingly. The proposal then was that the County Court should become a constituent part of the High Court, that there should be a power to sue therein to an unlimited extent, but with an absolute right of removal. That proposal was not at that time adopted, but there can be no doubt, I think, that the general drift of the legislation which has taken place since has been to confer a very wide jurisdiction upon County Courts, and, therefore, to show the confidence that the country has in the administration of justice in these Courts.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Earl that there is an enormous mass of Acts which confer jurisdiction in one form or another upon County Courts, but when the statistics are looked through that great mass of Acts does not produce a vast amount of work. Some Acts do, such as Admiralty Acts, and there are large powers given to County Courts under the Rivers Pollution Act, the Agricultural Holdings Act, and the Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Acts, and an enormous number of cases come before them much exceeding the amount which we considered should give the defendant the right of removal; and, lastly, they have a most extensive bankruptcy jurisdiction. They deal with all bankruptcy work outside London. The effect of that is to show that they have been entrusted with very large and extensive powers in the way of dealing with judicial business. The last extension was in 1903, when their jurisdiction was increased to &#x00A3;100. All this suggests that there has been an answer made to demands for conferring this jurisdiction, and the great reason why those facilities have been so much appreciated is that the cases come on quickly, and that they are carried through exceedingly cheaply.<lb/>
The jurisdiction having been thus extended, I will show to what extent the extended jurisdiction has been acted upon. I find that in 1907, that is after the jurisdiction had been extended to &#x00A3;100, 2,409 cases were disposed of between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;100, and
<col>740</col>
573 cases over &#x00A3;100 were taken in these Courts by agreement. That is a very remarkable figure, because the whole of the cases tried on the Circuits of the High Court in England during that year were only 580 &#x2014;that is to say, nearly as many cases were taken by consent in the County Court as were taken as of right in the High Court throughout the whole of the Circuits. There is, in addition, the City of London Court, where, in 1907, 586 actions of over &#x00A3;50 and under &#x00A3;100 were taken, and 151 actions over &#x00A3;100 by consent. I do not quote these figures as showing anything more than this, that the legislation which has conferred this position on the County Courts has shown in its result a tendency to resort to these Courts, and that agreement to try cases there is extending with considerable rapidity.<lb/>
The proposals made in this Bill have also been put before your Lordships' House on a previous occasion. Lord Cairns's Bill of 1879 had much more drastic clauses in it than are contained in this Bill. The proposals in that Bill were that cases up to &#x00A3;200 should, as of right, be dealt with in the County Court; that any case over that sum could be brought, but that there should be a right of removal if it exceeded &#x00A3;200. The position, therefore, is that this is not a novel proposition, and it is one which I should venture to suggest ought to commend itself to the Committee. That it is not a very remarkable thing in legislation may be illustrated by this fact. In Scotland the whole of the Sheriff Courts have unlimited jurisdiction over all contracts and all torts, with a right of removal into the Court of Session when the claim is over &#x00A3;50; and I am informed that in Glasgow five Sheriff-Substitutes are daily at work dealing with cases of unlimited amount and disposing of the business in that way. That is in no way different from the proposal put forward in this Bill, except that there is a right of removal there at &#x00A3;50 and here it is proposed that the right of removal should be at &#x00A3;100. The Committee over which I presided came to the conclusion that there was great dissatisfaction in the country as to the way in which the High Court work was being done, because of the inconvenience that was felt at Assizes and the shortness of time that could be allowed, the point being that the work of the Assizes had to be fitted to the time allowed instead of
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0374"/>

the time being fitted to the work that ought to be done. We accordingly recommended that the circuit system should be entirely remodelled, that the principle of concentration of civil business indicated by the Council of Judges in 1892 should be applied, and that so far as possible country civil cases should be grouped at suitable centres in the country. That was the basis of this Report, and that necessitated in our view a greater increase of strength for the purpose of carrying out that recommendation.<lb/>
But when we came to consider the position which finds itself stated in the first clause of this Bill, we thought that these facilities should be given for the reasons which I will state shortly. We reported that&#x2014;
<quote>"There is at present power in these Courts to try any Common Law action without limitation of amount by written consent of the parties, and this has been used to the extent shown in the statistics above given, so that it is incorrect to say, as some do, that this power is practically useless. There is no reason why, if parties are content, and wish to try in the County Courts they should not continue to do so, provided that time can be found to hear their cases, and that larger and longer cases do not interfere with the primary duties of the Courts, and it may be that if that which can now be done by consent were to be carried through unless objected to, a certain percentage of persons might be found who, while they would not consent, would not object. But if a case be a proper one to be heard in the High Court, can it be doubted that the defendant would at once appear in the High Court and assert his right to a transfer? We are strongly of opinion that the true remedy to be sought for is not by encouraging litigants to contest their cases in Courts which were not intended to deal with these cases, and must for the reasons already given find difficulties, and be at a disadvantage in attempting to do so, but to provide that completely adequate facilities should be given by the High Court for disposing of every ease which it is reasonable should be both commenced and continued in it. At the same time we have to recognise the fact that a considerable number of cases between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;100 are now launched in the County Court, and a further number of over &#x00A3;100 are taken there by consent, and that some demand appears to exist in some quarters for further facility to try in the County Courts particular Common Law cases suitable to be tried there but exceeding the money limit triable except by written consent, and in which cases the written consent is sometimes refused merely because asked for by the opponent."</quote>
We went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"We think that no change in the extent of the jurisdiction of the County Courts should be made, but that a better method of working the system and combining it with the High Court system should be adopted, and that if the fourth suggestion, which we deal with later on, were acted on, a means may be found which would meet most of the present difficulties.".</quote>
<col>742</col>
Those who took the view that I took about this matter, feeling that the difficulty was that the High Court at the time was not in a position to give that satisfaction on Circuit that it should do and that to extend the jurisdiction at all the County Courts might have the effect of driving people to the County Courts, thought that if the proposals made in this Report as to the substantial improvement of the High Court were carried through, this provision should be added. There is a demand that the County Court should have the facilities suggested. There is no danger of overworking the Courts if adequate facility is provided elsewhere, and the Lord Chancellor, with the assistance of the Lord Chief Justice, has taken steps to remove the want of facility that has existed on the Circuits. Some of the proposals suggested in this direction have already been adopted, and if it should be thought that any further increase of strength is wanted, then comes in my Amendment introducing a subsection enabling the clause to be brought into force as soon as it is shown that the High Court is working satisfactorily. The Committee, with the exception of one, were entirely in favour of the suggestion on which the clause was based, though there was a division of opinion as to whether it should be dependent or not dependent upon the approval of the proposals as to the High Court.<lb/>
The point is that, by consent, the County Courts now have this jurisdiction; but you cannot always get consent. This clause reverses the position. Under it a case can be put down, and, unless the other party objects, it goes on in the County Court, but, if he does object, it is removed to the High Court. Two-thirds of the whole of the cases tried and disposed of in the High Court are under &#x00A3;200. I conceive it must be very difficult to discriminate between the capacity of a Judge to try a case up to &#x00A3;100 and his capacity to try one up to &#x00A3;200. It is said, first of all, that these Courts are not suited because they will have too much work. This matter so far as regards the question of time formed the subject of a report by ten County Court Judges to my Committee. An estimate was given by which it was shown that if the proposals found in the other parts of this Bill were carried into effect, a very considerable amount of the time of County Court Judges would be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0375"/>
<col>743</col>
saved and would be available for the particular work which would arise under the extended jurisdiction; and these ten Judges signed a Report including this proposition, that any action, other than certain excepted ones, might be commenced in the County Court but should be removable if required.<lb/>
Let me point out how this Bill proposes to meet the points raised. First of all it is said that there will not be time. The Bill proposes to eliminate sittings at certain small places unless it is absolutely necessary to go there. That would effect an economy of time. It proposes to concentrate cases above &#x00A3;50 at certain specified centres in the country. The other proposals in the Bill will be found to be directed to rearrangements of County Court Circuits so as to make the work more equal, and in that way there is great possibility of adding to the amount of time at the disposal of the Judges. There are other points of great importance. The first is that the Bill proposes to give opportunities to Registrars to dispose of the business which is so largely the work of County Courts. It does not propose to give Registrars any jurisdiction to decide disputed cases unless the parties agree. And when it is found that something like ninety-eight per cent. of the verdicts in cases in the County Courts are for the plaintiff, and that the average verdict is for under &#x00A3;5&#x2014;in most cases it is under &#x00A3;3&#x2014;it is perfectly obvious that the great bulk of the work is debt collecting. The proposal in the Bill is that the Registrars shall deal with all those cases unless the parties want the Judge to deal with them. The result of relieving the Judge of this small work will be to give him more time to devote to the larger work; and if the question of committal for debt were dealt with, and if that were abolished, the time at the disposal of the Judges would be enormously increased. I hold that there is a clear demonstration, from the course of legislation, that the County Courts have been entrusted with more and more work because they give rapid and cheap facilities; that if those facilities are desired by the people they should have them; that it does not in the least affect the position if the defendant has his right to remove his case if it is over a certain sum; and that, in fact, this clause carries out a scheme which has been proposed from time to time and one which
<col>744</col>
cannot really be detrimental in any way to the administration of justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01640"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, any one who tries his hand at law reform has one great discouragement. It is that the public take very little interest in it because they do not understand it. He also has this further disadvantage, that he often gets but slender encouragement from those of his own profession who do understand it. I will endeavour, as shortly as I can, to try and persuade your Lordships not to wreck this Bill by striking out a vital part of it in regard to which I cannot understand how any unfairness can be alleged. May I say one word more in preface? I have said that my own profession has nearly always opposed reforms in law, and history will bear me out in every particular if you choose to study it. But I have always admitted that the noble and learned Earl has brought forward many valuable law reforms, to which I have always done justice, and which he will remember I invariably supported to the utmost of my power in the other House of Parliament. Nor will I ever endeavour the vain task of setting myself up as a rival to him in the matter of law reform.<lb/>
We are told that this is a portentous and unprecedented change. The evil of litigation is that it is so expensive, and it is expensive because justice is not localised. What is our remedy? We have in the County Courts, which are situated all over the country, a tribunal which has now by law, if the parties sign a preliminary consent, power to try almost any kind of case. People who are litigating seldom will sign a preliminary consent before the action is commenced, and if an action is commenced by the issue of a writ it is outside the jurisdiction of the County Court. What is proposed in this Bill&#x2014;and I do not deny that it is likely to make a very effective change&#x2014;is to say, You can begin your action in the County Court if you like, subject to this, that the defendant has an absolute unqualified right to remove it to the High Court if he thinks proper, without any interlocutory proceedings whatever, simply by entering appearance in the High Court instead of in the County Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01641"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: That is not in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01642"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: With all respect to the noble and learned Earl,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0376"/>
<col>745</col>
it is in the Bill. At any rate, in my opinion it is in the Bill, and I will justify that statement when we come to the clause. If it is not in the Bill then it is the first time I have heard it suggested, because that is the scheme. The defendant has an absolute right to this under the Bill. That being the case, what possible harm can there be in the proposition? I deny that there is anything portentous in it or that it can work any possible hardship. I really fail to appreciate the severity of the criticism of the noble and learned Earl. Is it contended that the County Courts are incompetent? That can hardly be said. Surely if the parties choose to trust the County Court Judge, this House is not going to say that the County Court Judge is not fit to be trusted in a matter within his department. In Scotland, as my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell has pointed out, the Sheriff Court has unlimited jurisdiction; nearly all the business is conducted locally, and to the universal satisfaction of the community. These Sheriffs are paid about one-half the salaries that County Court Judges receive. Then it is said that the County Court Judge will be too much occupied if you give him this work. We propose that he shall be relieved of petty cases by giving a jurisdiction up to &#x00A3;5 to the Registrar, subject to rules. We say that, with consent, the Registrar may have jurisdiction up to &#x00A3;5. The noble and learned Earl cannot himself complain of that, because he introduced a Bill giving jurisdiction up to &#x00A3;5 to a good many Registrars.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01643"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Registrars selected by the Lord Chancellor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01644"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: If the proposal to give a jurisdiction up to &#x00A3;5 to Registrars is thought to be going too far, let the noble and learned Earl move an Amendment to that effect, and if he pressed it I would agree, although surely all Registrars are competent to try cases under &#x00A3;5. This kind of criticism, I hope, will not prevail in your Lordships' House, although I recognise the weight which Lord Halsbury's opinion does hold in this House and does justifiably hold. My noble and learned friend says that everyone ought to have the right of trial before a High Court Judge. But he has that right under the proposals of this Bill, because all he has to do is to enter an appearance in the High Court to remove the case to that Court. I think I have answered all the points that were put
<col>746</col>
by the noble and learned Earl. He also referred to the fact that the consent of some members of Lord Gorell's Committee was contingent upon an increase of the staff of the High Court. That matter has gone to a Joint Committee of both Houses. If that Committee think that there ought to be more Judges then I suppose that opinion would probably prevail, but I may be permitted to say, with the greatest possible respect to His Majesty's Judges, that I, for my part, have declined to recommend that this step is necessary. I do not think it is necessary, but at the same time I am so far from pretending to anything like infallibility in this matter that if the Joint Committee of both Houses report in favour of such increase I should be willing, as I have said, to accept their recommendation.<lb/>
I would point out that the proposal in this clause has been recommended by a Committee of representative men of great experience and knowledge, and Lord Gorell has informed your Lordships that the very strong Royal Commission in 1872 recommended this. He has also told you that Lord Cairns introduced into and passed through this House in 1879 proposals compared with which my modest proposals are comparatively insignificant. Lord Cairns proposed the same kind of machinery, though slightly different in form. Under his Bill any action could be commenced in the County Court, but he required that a Motion should be made to remove it. I propose that it should be capable of removal simply by entering an appearance. Lord Cairns did more. He proposed to give the same facilities in every kind of action, both in Common Law and Chancery. I have been so terrified by opposition that I have put my proposals in more modest form. Lord Cairns also proposed to increase the compulsory jurisdiction of County Courts up to &#x00A3;200. I feel that it would be too dangerous for me to make any such revolutionary proposal.<lb/>
The opinion of the Bar on this proposal has been referred to. I have a most sincere affection for the profession to which I owe everything, and I am quite certain that the interests of the Bar will never be furthered and will never abide if they are not consonant to and harmonious with the interests of the public, and I am confident that the Bar will never really desire to hinder a reform which is in the interests of the public. I also believe that in respect to these special sittings set up all over England with the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0377"/>
<col>747</col>
County Court Judges trying important cases the Bar will find it to be of advantage, because this measure will give facilities for the kind of litigation to which the majority of people would wish to have recourse in the desire to obtain justice.</membercontribution></p>

There are one or two contentious clauses, but as to some I have the satisfaction of knowing that the Lord Chancellor has actually put down Amendments to give effect to objections which I raised on the Second Reading of the Bill. I am most anxious to co-operate in this matter with the Lord Chancellor, and I trust that because it has seemed to the majority of this House that it is not a wise thing to extend by this side wind the jurisdiction of County Courts to the extent proposed, the Lord Chancellor will not sacrifice the Bill.</p>

My Lords, I do not desire, and it would not be in order to do so, to enter into any discussion on the merits of the clause which has just been thrown out or the merits of the Bill generally. I have no doubt that my noble and learned friend will pay due regard to the appeal which has been made by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, and will take into careful consideration whether it is worth while to proceed further with this Bill. As regards the whole matter, and in connection with the desire of my noble and learned friend not to proceed further at this moment, I should like to say this. The Bill has, at any rate, lost what I think may be called its principal limb, and some surprise may be felt that, in the circumstances, it was allowed to go through a Second Reading at all. The noble and learned Earl opposite seemed to use the argument that these proposals had not been sufficiently considered, and that there was no evidence of popular support. I just desire to point out this, that we make it our endeavour to introduce Bills into your Lordships' House when we can. There are a large number of Bills which, as your Lordships are aware, cannot be introduced in this House, and it is a somewhat poor encouragement to us to introduce Bills here at all if they are liable to be more or less strangled at birth by the intervention of noble Lords opposite. We shall be bound to bear that in mind when it is a question of introducing

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01683"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to the South Africa Bill, a Bill which closes one chapter in the history of South Africa and begins a new one. It closes a chapter which has been varied and sometimes agitated, but on the whole not inglorious or unfruitful. It opens one in turning the first pages of which we feel hopes for the future which we believe that the circumstances fully justify. My Lords, this is not the time or the place for anything like a long historical disquisition on the causes which have led up to this proposal for the Union of South Africa; but I think it is not unsuitable that I should endeavour to trace very briefly some points in that history and some of those causes.<lb/>
Of all the Dominions of His Majesty the King, South Africa is the one which least of any represents a long, conscious attempt towards a White settlement and the development of a great White community. During the 400 years and more that South Africa has been known to Europe&#x2014;during the greater part of those 400 years it has been treated as a stopping-place on the great highway to the East, rather as a wayside inn than as a place of permanent sojourn. Both the Portuguese and the Dutch, and finally the British, who have in turn occupied different parts of the country, have, in the main, so regarded it; and it is from this fact that we can trace many of the vicissitudes of government through which South Africa has passed, and what may be almost
<col>754</col>
called the fortuitous birth of the colonies which compose it.<lb/>
Some of the colonies started simply as ports of call on the coast, and filled up from time to time by refugees and others from Europe they gradually pushed their way inland, often, as we know, with serious opposition and difficulty caused by the native tribes. Other colonies represent the work of pioneers who pushed their way far into the wilderness, for the most part escaping what they conceived to be an unsympathetic form of government. From the time when the Cape became British, in the year 1814, history tells us that there has been from time to time more than one movement to escape from the somewhat uninformed control exercised from this country. The most famous of those movements was what is known as the Great Trek of 1836. I am afraid, my Lords, it must be admitted that the domestic virtues of Downing-street have sometimes been Imperial vices. The whole tone and trend of policy of a great part of the nineteenth century certainly did not tend towards the union or amalgamation of the different races which by that time had found in considerable numbers their homes in South Africa. To abolish slavery was a good thing in itself, but even slavery may be abolished in a sympathetic spirit and with due regard to the losses which those who owned the slaves might sustain. But, my Lords, for many years past there have been gropings in the direction of union of which I may venture briefly to remind your Lordships.<lb/>
The man who, I think, might be described as the father of the idea of South African union was that very distinguished Colonial Governor, Sir George Grey. When Sir George Grey was there in 1858 the Orange Free State made advances towards some system of federation or union&#x2014;advances which he, the man on the spot, of whom we have heard so much since, was in favour of meeting. But in those days, as I have said, the idea of such union was not very palatable at home. The Colonial Secretary of that day was Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, whom I have heard Mr. Gladstone describe as in many respects one of the best of Colonial Secretaries, and the Under-Secretary was Lord Carnarvon. Neither of these men was prepared to take this particular responsibility. Lord Carnarvon, if I remember rightly, described Sir George Grey as a very
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0381"/>
<col>755</col>
dangerous man, and the result was that nothing was done.<lb/>
But later on the mind of Lord Carnarvon became affected by different influences. In 1867 he was responsible to a great extent for the British North America Bill, by which the Dominion of Canada was created, and the success of that measure undoubtedly induced him to make some further attempt towards uniting the Colonies of South Africa. Accordingly, in 1876 and 1877, that movement towards union took place, which unfortunately came to nothing, inspired, as it was, by high motives, but not, perhaps, carried out with complete understanding. It failed in one respect, if I may adopt a phrase used by my noble friend Lord Selborne&#x2014;it failed because it was not home-made. It was suggested and was almost attempted to be forced on the colonies from here, and consequently it was abortive.<lb/>
Then, as your Lordships know, in 1877 the Transvaal was annexed and in 1881 it was restored, and I need not remind your Lordships of the chequered series of events which finally led up to the war between this country and the Dutch Republics. I will only remind your Lordships that in 1872 Cape Colony received full responsible government and that Natal received it in 1893. My Lords, after the war, when peace was declared in 1902, a new section of history naturally began, and from that time the movement for union which culminates in this Bill has been progressing.<lb/>
If I may diverge for one moment, I have remarked with some amusement, but also, I confess, with some regret, the fear which has been publicly expressed by some of those who do not agree with us in politics that His Majesty's Government are likely to claim an undue share of credit for this Act of Union. I do not know exactly what we have done to excite those fears. But the result has been that, both freely in the Press and also, I think, freely on the platform, attempts have been made to show that a great part of the credit for this Act belongs to our predecessors, in particular to Mr. Chamberlain and to the noble Viscount on the Cross Benches, Lord Milner. I have no intention of entering into any discussion of questions of this kind on the present occasion. Neither the right hon. gentleman nor the
<col>756</col>
noble Viscount has, so far as I know, put forward any such claim on his own account. They would prefer, I have no doubt, just as I greatly prefer, to leave questions of that kind to the verdict of history. The Macaulays and the Froudes of the future in writing the history of this time will have their heroes and their malefactors, as their predecessors have had. Indeed, I am not sure that some gentlemen, perhaps not exactly Macaulays or Froudes, have not already started the process. But the historian of the future, whoever he may be, and without raising any question of credit, will undoubtedly point out that this particular Act of Union has been made possible by the action of the Government of the late Prime Minister, Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, in sending the Commission to South Africa in 1906, with the result that the two Colonies&#x2014;the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, as it was then called&#x2014;obtained responsible government. And when dealing with questions of credit the historian will, I think, point out that that action was undoubtedly due to the general political creed held by the Government, to their more robust faith in the virtues of self-government as such than their predecessors probably held. I do not think I should be greatly wronging the Party of noble Lords opposite if I were to say that they would prefer in the main to adopt the eighteenth century maxim,
<quote>"For forms of government let fools contest, Whate'er is best administered is best."</quote>
and to hold that outside this island self-government is a remedy which should be administered with the greatest possible caution. The historian of the future may perhaps point out&#x2014;perhaps he will&#x2014;that in these matters to do the thing at the right moment counts for much, and that if that act had been much longer postponed it was at any rate possible that there might have arisen on the one side a hard temper of ascendancy and on the other side a sullen spirit of dissatisfaction which might have rendered it difficult to perform the act at all. If that be so, then I do think that credit is especially due to two men&#x2014;to the late Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and my predecessor, Lord Elgin&#x2014;for the part they took in that matter.<lb/>
My Lords, when we pass from how this Union was made possible to how it was carried out, we can then abolish the figure of the historian and can distribute the necessary
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0382"/>
<col>757</col>
credit without any fear of being in error. First and foremost, credit belongs to the remarkable band of statesmen in South Africa, representing all parties and both races, who have set to work and carried through this business. We are glad to know that almost all of them have been able to come to this country and see their work through. They have been welcomed here, and will be welcomed as long as they stay with us, by persons of every class and every party. Their names are, most of them, household words to us all. I will only mention one, because he presided over the delegation, my friend Sir Henry de Villiers, to whose skill and experience so much of the success of this measure is due. The others I will dispose of in a single line&#x2014;
<quote>"Ductoresque alii quos Africa terra triumphis Dives alit."</quote>
Then, my Lords, I must not forget to acknowledge the help that was given by the different Governors representing His Majesty in South Africa, and in particular I must mention my noble friend Lord Selborne, who for the time being is out of the main rushing current of politics and seated in a placid back water on the Cross Benches of your Lordships' House. We have all been grateful for the industry and the skill which Lord Selborne has shown in the part which he has played.<lb/>
Now, there were two great motive forces which propelled South Africa towards union. In the first place, there were the Imperial considerations which made South African statesmen desire to form a union which could take a place in the Empire beside the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion of New Zealand, and that was undoubtedly a strong motive. But in addition to this, there were, of course, local and practical considerations of the first importance. In the first place, there was an obvious and desirable economy in working the four colonies as one. In the second place&#x2014;and this, I think, perhaps more than anything, was the immediate cause which brought practical men to see how necessary union was&#x2014;there were the difficulties and complications arising out of the railway systems of the different Colonies. What those difficulties were I will not trouble your Lordships with at this moment; but I may, perhaps, be allowed to say that when Lord Milner was administering both the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony he did his best to diminish those difficulties
<col>758</col>
and differences by amalgamating as far as possible the railway systems of those two Colonies. Then, there were questions arising out of the Customs, also a complicated subject with the details of which I will not trouble the House. All these practical considerations affected the minds of practical men there, and the result was that early in the year 1907 a communication was made first from the Cape which inspired an important and interesting Memorandum on the subject prepared by Lord Selborne, with which, I daresay, some of your Lordships are familiar. The year 1908 was taken up with conferences which led to the formation of the Convention, which, as your Lordships know, met first at Durban, where we were glad to be able to send a squadron of the British navy to do honour to the occasion, afterwards at Cape Town, and, lastly, at Bloemfontein. Now the Bill having passed the respective South African Parliaments, the delegation have come here, and the result is this measure which I now submit to your Lordships.<lb/>
The form of this Bill, I may say in passing, follows rather the Canadian than the Australian model. The second part of the Bill, which describes the union, leads me to remark that, in my judgment, South Africa was wise to decide on a system of union rather than on a system of federation. The system of federation is one which is always naturally favoured by the smaller members of a great polity. A system that makes Delaware and Nevada the equivalents for the purposes of the Constitution of New York and of Pennsylvania is one which is naturally favoured by the former States. It was naturally in Natal that the greatest doubts arose as between federation and unification, and I should like to bear witness to the wise and steady guidance of the Natal Government in this matter, which resulted in the gratifying fact that when the Bill was submitted to a, popular <i>referendum</i> a majority for it was obtained in every district to which it was referred. My Lords, I need not dwell on the appointment of the Governor-General, who naturally replaces the existing Governors, or on the formation of the Executive which follows the usual rule in such matters. But I pass to the fourth part of the Bill, which deals with the constitution of Parliament.<lb/>
The Parliament as is the invariable rule in the British Empire will consist of two Houses.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0383"/>
<col>759</col>
The Upper House&#x2014;the Senate&#x2014;consists of eight gentlemen elected from each of the four Colonies, with eight others nominated, four of whom, as I particularly beg you to observe, are to be selected owing to their acquaintance with native affairs. Provisions are made in Clauses 25 and 26 of the Bill for the future election of the Senate. The House of Assembly consists of 121 members drawn in varying proportions from the different colonies, a certain preference in numbers being given to the smaller provinces, as they will become. There is a provision for increasing their number as population increases, and on that I ask your Lordships to note that the quota for that increase is confined entirely to the European male adults. The country will be divided into electoral divisions, and in the 40th Clause there are five considerations indicated which the Commission may bear in mind in delimiting&#x2014;such as physical features, means of communication, sparsity and density of population, with the possibility of allowing fifteen per cent. margin on the quota either way.<lb/>
When we come to the qualification for sitting in either House we approach a point which has been the subject of much discussion and as to which many protests have been made. Those who sit in either House of Parliament have to be of European descent. So far, the position is that in the Cape Colony no such restriction has hitherto existed. On the other hand, no one not of European descent has ever sat in the Cape House of Assembly. I say frankly that there does seem to me to be a strong case against the insertion of such a provision in this Act or in any Act. There are men not of European descent who are of high standing, of high character, and of high ability. They regard this provision as a slight, and we regret that any loyal subjects of the King should consider themselves slighted.<lb/>
On the other hand, the difficulties which have confronted those who have prepared this Bill were no doubt considerable. In the first place it is only in the Cape that the native has a vote; and therefore it would seem anomalous to allow a man to sit in an Assembly for which the class to which he belongs have not a vote in the greater part of the Union. It is also fair to point out that in the Australian Commonwealth a similar restriction exists, so that therefore, this cannot be said to be without precedent. It is also true that the grievance is probably
<col>760</col>
not a practical one, because if it was the case that no coloured member was elected to the Cape Assembly in the past it is extremely improbable, at any rate for a long time to come, that any such would be elected to the Union Parliament. The fact which has decided us in not attempting to press this matter against the wishes of the South African delegates has been that this is undoubtedly one of those matters which represents a delicately balanced compromise between themselves. As a Government we cannot take&#x2014;and personally I am not prepared to take&#x2014;the responsibility for the possible wrecking of this Union measure altogether by a provision of this kind; and I am assured that such would be the result of any attempt to insert such a provision in the Bill. The cause of those who desire this change to be made has been pressed with deep feeling and much eloquence by some of the natives themselves, and by those who specially represent their cause. But I do feel that if this change is to be made it must be made in South Africa by South Africans themselves, and that it is not possible for us, whatever we may consider to be the special merits of the case, to attempt to force it upon the great representative body which with absolute unanimity demands that it should not appear.<lb/>
I pass to the question of the franchise, which is one that has also raised a consideration of some difficulty. At present in the Cape Colony any man, whatever his colour, who possesses &#x00A3;75 worth of property or &#x00A3;50 a year, and who can write his name and address, can get a vote. In Natal the provisions for obtaining a vote are somewhat similar; but as a matter of fact the native has to obtain what is called a letter of exemption, with the result that very few natives indeed are on the register. In the Transvaal and in the Orange River Colony there is manhood suffrage for Whites, and no native vote at all. It is obvious from that description how difficult the problem was if there was to be any question of instituting a uniform franchise all over the Union. It was ultimately decided that Parliament was to prescribe the form of the franchise, it being, however, provided that the Cape vote should be saved to the native unless it was decided by a two-thirds majority of both Houses sitting together to abolish the native franchise there. This is said by those who desire to see the interests of the native in every way protected to involve a somewhat serious
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0384"/>
<col>761</col>
risk that the Cape franchise itself might be done away with. I think we may assume that as far as the rest of the Union is concerned it will be in future a white franchise.<lb/>
It would require, as you see, some 106 members of both Houses sitting together to abolish the franchise at the Cape. I think it may be assumed that it would require more than this, because it is not likely that the nominated Senators, especially those who are appointed for their interest in the natives, would be likely to join in a venture of that kind. Therefore, from that point of view, as far as South Africa itself is concerned, there does not seem to be much risk. It has also to be remembered that this is a matter on which we could not say that the power of disallowance which, of course, belongs to the Crown, would not be exercised. Certainly it is not too much to say that the disfranchisement of a class who had held this power of voting so long would be viewed here with very deep disappointment. Disfranchisement is always an odious thing in itself, and if it were to be applied in this particular manner I am bound to say that it would assume a somewhat specially odious form. Consequently I myself refuse to believe that there is any probability that this particular provision will be carried into effect. Looking at it as a purely abstract question, we could wish that the safeguard might be even stronger, but such as it is I am prepared to consider it strong enough. I may remind your Lordships also that there is a provision for the reservation of all constitutional Bills, and for reservation subject to instructions received from the Crown; and all Bills which desire to alter any provision in the Schedule are automatically reserved.<lb/>
I will touch briefly on the creation of the new provinces. They will be governed by administrators appointed for a term of years by the Government and by Councils, and it is worth noting that as far as the Cape is concerned the natives can both vote for and sit on the Provincial Councils. The Ordinances of the Provincial Councils will be subject to the approval of the Governor-General in Council. There is a list of subjects with which the Provincial Councils may deal, and there is a provision for purely local subjects being reserved to them. But all such matters as Crown lands, public works, mines, and so forth are by the Bill left in charge of the Union Parliament.<lb/>
I pass quickly over the creation of the judiciary. It is a great thing that the
<col>762</col>
whole of the judicial body of South Africa should be united into one High Court. I merely touch on the question of appeal to the Privy Council, to say that if it should appear to any one who studies these provisions that the right of appeal is more restricted in this Act than it is in some other Acts dealing with the self-governing dominions, it is due to the fact that this single High Court is created for the whole of South Africa. Nor do I dwell on Part VII of the Bill, which deals with finance and railway matters, further than once more to enforce the opinion as to the immense gain which it is to bring the railway system of South Africa under one control and one management. Clause 137 prescribes equality between the two languages, and Clause 147 makes special provision for the control of subjects affecting Asiatics being left to the Union Parliament. As your Lordships know, there have been in more than one Colony some difficulties in the past arising out of the presence of Asiatics there and out of the regulations made concerning them. It will be a still further benefit if the establishment of this Union enables South Africa to dispose of those difficulties, and I sincerely hope that such may prove to be the case.<lb/>
Then the native lands are safeguarded by the same clause. That brings me to Clause 151 of the Bill, the clause which enables what are known as the Protectorates possibly at some future time to be transferred to the care of the Union under regulations provided for in a Schedule. The South African Union finds itself in a unique position&#x2014;a different position from that of any other part of the Empire. Not only has it got a vast native population within its borders, but just outside its borders, and in one case entirely surrounded by the Union itself, there are whole countries, hitherto directly administered by the Crown, in some cases almost entirely inhabited by natives and carried on under the immemorial tribal system. Those Protectorates have been under our direct administration, and towards them we feel that we have a very solemn duty indeed. They were, speaking generally, not conquered by the arms of Great Britain, but came voluntarily under our control. They feel a profound confidence in the British Government, a confidence which has been largely inspired by able men who from time to time have administered them, and when the question of union became urgent,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0385"/>
<col>763</col>
we had to consider what was the best course to take in view of our honourable obligations towards the Protectorates. We felt bound to regard ourselves as trustees for these bodies of natives, and considering that it does not do for a trustee to hand over his trust to another man, however great his personal confidence may be in him, without a guarantee that the trust itself will be taken over, we decided to ask South Africa to accept the provisions embodied in the Schedule. Some opposition has been raised to the Schedule from two very different quarters. Some think that under no circumstances ought the native Protectorates to be handed over to the Union at all.<lb/>
Here I may say that we have no desire, we are in no hurry, to hand over these areas to anyone. They are contented, they are not otherwise than prosperous, and we have no desire to part with them; in fact, they have expressed themselves as averse to passing from under the direct administration of the Crown. But we do feel that in any case that suggestion involves an impossibility. It does not seem conceivable that for an indefinite future these areas should remain administered from here and that the new South African Union should have no lot or part in their administration. Nor do I believe, in view of the varying circumstances of these districts, that it is possible to name a time limit and say, at any rate, we will not hand over a particular area for a fixed number of years. That is a course which might have its attractions, but if you do that, it seems to me you cannot combine that provision in the Bill with the existence of the terms embodied in the Schedule, because although we do not desire to hand over the Protectorates, yet the existence of the Schedule undoubtedly contemplates their being possibly handed over at some time to be fixed by agreement.<lb/>
On the other hand, there are those who contemplate the Protectorates being handed over, but consider that it is not necessary to make any preliminary arrangement with regard to them, and that it would be better to wait and deal with each case as it arises. To my mind there are strong objections to that course. It is extremely advantageous to lay down, as we have laid down in the Schedule, with the full concurrence of South African opinion, certain general principles in order that continuity of
<col>764</col>
administration may exist, and in order that, above all, uncertainty may be avoided. By introducing this Schedule we at any rate obtain a certain uniform and agreed standard of administration. What weighs with me as much as anything is that the natives themselves are not anxious to be transferred, but, admitting that they may be some day transferred, actively desire the incorporation of a charter such as this in the Act itself. To me those reasons seem conclusive for the existence of this somewhat unusual form of provision in the form of a Schedule.<lb/>
I will now give a brief outline of what the Schedule does. The Schedule lays down that the Government should legislate for and administer the Protectorates when they are taken over; and when I say the Protectorates I, perhaps, need hardly say that I am alluding to Basutoland, though strictly it is not a Protectorate, to Bechuanaland, and to Swaziland. It is the name by which they have for convenience been described. The Government will legislate by Provisional Order, which will be laid on the Table of the Houses of Parliament in the ordinary way. It may be asked, What is the object of this provision? If these native territories are going to be handed over, why not let them be legislated for by Parliament like the rest of the country? One may have an almost unqualified admiration for Parliamentary government, and yet may be disposed to think that a Parliament in which certain people are not represented may not be the best machine for administering the daily life of those people, particularly when the constituents of those who sit in the Parliament may have interests at direct variance with the interests of those for whom it is proposed to legislate. Consequently it is the absence of representation&#x2014;because no one supposes that if taken over these natives will be represented in Parliament&#x2014;which is the basis of the proposals in the Schedule. Those proposals involve the institution of something in the nature of a permanent buffer between the territories and Parliament. The Prime Minister, or a regularly appointed deputy nominated by him, is to be the Minister responsible for the government of these territories, and he will be advised by a Commission which will undoubtedly be composed of men of distinction and experience, not removable except by a vote of both Houses of Parliament. This will involve, as we hope, and
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0386"/>
<col>765</col>
secure that continuity which of all possible considerations in dealing with natives is perhaps the most necessary of any.<lb/>
There is always a danger in attempting to govern a native country of causing the natives to become the plaything of the varying policy of parties&#x2014;parties the existence of which may depend on entirely extraneous matters with which they themselves have no concern. We here have been able to keep clear of that difficulty and danger by being so far removed in our Parliament from those great areas which we administer directly. But it is a difficulty which I am certain might probably arise in South Africa without the creation of some such body. For that reason I am glad to know its creation is welcomed by many South African statesmen. This body possesses a certain analogy &#x2014;though not an analogy that must be ridden too hard&#x2014;both in its composition and its functions with the Council which in London advises the Secretary of State for India. It has, however, certain powers larger than those of my noble friend's Council, of recording dissent.<lb/>
Then the Schedule provides against the alienation of native lands, which involves the prohibition of indiscriminate prospecting; it provides against the supply of liquor to natives; and it provides that the restrictions which may exist in any of these territories on the supply of liquor to other than natives shall not be weakened if the territories are taken over. It also provides for the permanence of the native assemblies which have existed heretofore. These are the securities which we conceive to be given by the Schedule. It would not have been proposed from South Africa itself; but I believe it has been frankly accepted by South Africa, and that its actual provisions obtained the approval in the main of those who are entitled to speak for the Union.<lb/>
One point has been raised, and may possibly be raised again. It might be said, What security have you when the Union is formed and the customs and the railways of South Africa are in one hand, that these territories, while they are still under your control, may not be subjected to differential duties or to differential railway rates? We do not guard in the Act against action of that kind. But I am assured that the delegates see no reason whatever to doubt that the liberal policy pursued in
<col>766</col>
regard to these matters&#x2014;that is to say, by which the territories have been admitted to the Customs Union&#x2014;will be continued so long as the territories remain under our control. I am quite prepared frankly to accept that opinion&#x2014;which is as much, no doubt, as it is possible for the delegates to give, because they cannot answer for the doings of a Government which is not yet formed&#x2014;I am prepared to accept that opinion and to agree. I do so for two reasons&#x2014;first, because that opinion was freely and willingly given; and, secondly, because any action of the kind directed against a territory under the administration of the Crown would be so grave from every point of view, would approach so nearly to what, in the language of diplomacy, would be described as an unfriendly act, that I do not for a moment contemplate the possibility of any such occurrence.<lb/>
Before I sit down I should like to ask you to consider for a moment what the Union does. I have spoken of the political and economic advantages which it must bring in its train to South Africa. What may the Union be also expected to do in the less visible but not less important sphere of human relations? This union of colonies marks, as I believe, a great advance in the fusion of the races which inhabit South Africa. The inhabitants of South Africa are some of British, some of Dutch, and some of French Huguenot descent. Their ancestors through many years of history suffered and fought for freedom. They underwent forfeiture and exile and imprisonment, and on the scaffold and on many battlefields they bore witness in the cause of civil and religious liberty. It would have been one of the most tragic ironies of all history if men descended from such races as those had remained permanently estranged. Now I hope we may look forward to seeing them joined in a free union under the supremacy of the British Crown, with a guaranteed freedom, for as many years in front of us as the imagination of man can venture to look.<lb/>
It has been the peculiar good fortune of this movement towards union that some of the actual work of union has been done in the process of discussion by bringing into intimate personal relations the different South African statesmen, soldiers, and lawyers who before that time may have known but little of each other. The result of union will be that the whole past history of South
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0387"/>
<col>767</col>
Africa will become the common possession for ever of all the races. The famous names of South African history will become the joint property of them all&#x2014;names familiar to many of us in a different relation from that which those who bore them ever expected. We may think of the chivalrous figure of Sir Harry Smith, whose name is still extant, and of his wife, so romantically won, whose name survives still more familiarly in association with recent events to which both races may look back with pride. Then there was Sir Benjamin D'Urban, one of the Governors who suffered from not being entirely understood at home. I have mentioned Sir George Grey, and I might mention many more. But we must not forget the names of the distinguished men who filled the office of President in the Dutch Republics, and here I will say that we are particularly glad to welcome here among the delegates from South Africa Mr. Steyn, whose wholehearted advocacy of union has been of the greatest assistance to the cause. Nor can we forget the now common property of the whole Union in the name of Cecil Rhodes, who amid all the agitations of political life always dreamed of the union of South Africa. These men lived their lives, they enjoyed their triumphs, they suffered their failures, and we now in the fulness of time are able to see that where they succeeded, and even where they failed, they often unconsciously were working towards the consummation of this great act of union. Therefore, without distinction of race, party, or creed, we can now say that we honour them all.<lb/>
I will now say one word from the Imperial standpoint. It is not necessary for us to roll up the map of the British Empire as Mr. Pitt desired to roll up the map of Europe, but it is tolerably safe to say that, so far as we can venture to see ahead, this Act of Union places the self-governing Dominions of the King in something like their final form. There is the great American group, the great Pacific group, and the great African group. There may be some re-arrangement and some modification, but it is, I think, reasonable to say that for many years to come, longer than the life of any of us here, these three great divisions will form the three main self-governing parts of the British Empire outside these islands. This fact will enable the advisers of the Crown here and in the Colonies and Dominions abroad to deal with questions

of Imperial defence with more certainty and with greater freedom than they have been able to deal with them hitherto. That is one point of gain. I will go further. If it should ever be the fact, as I hope it may, that it is found possible to solve the very difficult problem of co-operation all over the Empire in the policy of the Empire, to that achievement this Act of African Union is a necessary preliminary. I believe, therefore, that there will be no part of the Empire which will not give a most hearty welcome to the new South Africa, with earnest prayers that she may both merit and enjoy the rewards of prosperity and the blessings of peace. My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I commend it to your good offices, and I trust that it may pass in this House, and also in another place, without amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01685"><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who has had an opportunity of taking a small share in the working of a constitution not much older than that which we hope shortly to see established in South Africa, perhaps I may be permitted to add my congratulations to my noble friend Lord Selborne and his South African colleagues upon the measure of success which has attended their long and anxious deliberations, and I may further say that I associate myself entirely with the noble Earl opposite when he congratulated South Africa upon the shape that their scheme has taken, being that of union rather than of federation. I am glad to think that South Africa was ripe for union, and I congratulate them upon thereby getting rid of those inter-State and federal difficulties which certainly have not been conducive to the progress and prosperity of Australia. I trust that time, and no long time, will remove the friction which has thereby been caused, but undoubtedly in the meantime it is a serious inconvenience to public business.<lb/>
I have no intention of attempting to follow the noble Earl opposite into the details of the Bill, which he very naturally, as the responsible Minister, fully explained to the House. Indeed, the only criticism of the noble Earl's speech which I should be disposed to offer is in relation to his remarks as to how this union was made possible. I am inclined to think that when
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0388"/>
<col>769</col>
the noble Earl gave credit&#x2014;I do not by any means wish to say undeserved credit&#x2014;to the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and to Lord Elgin, he was trespassing a little upon matters which should rather form the subject of discussion on electoral platforms. We meet here, I believe, to-night with the sincere wish to assist His Majesty's Government by passing, unanimously and heartily, a measure so much desired by South Africa, and not to consider to which of the great political Parties in this country more or less credit may be due.<lb/>
There is one question which is likely to excite more attention in this country than any other in connection with this Bill, and that is the question of the electoral position of the coloured races in Cape Colony, and I have read with feelings of keen appreciation, and not without sympathy, the memorial which has been addressed to the citizens of this country by Mr. Schreiner and other distinguished signatories in South Africa. But I would venture to say that we must look at this question from the practical as well as the sentimental point of view. I would remind the gentlemen who signed that memorial of a single sentence in the memorial itself in which they say that to regard the South African question as an isolated one would be a grave mistake, and that what has to be considered is the whole idea underlying the sentiments of the independent and yet inter-dependent members of the community which go to make up the British Empire. Then I would ask this House to consider what that whole idea really is. I say unhesitatingly that, alike in the case of Canada, Australia, and South Africa, it is the determination to have white rule and white responsibility for the conduct of public affairs.<lb/>
I need hardly remind your Lordships that this question of the relationship between the coloured and white races must present itself from very different points of view to the inhabitants of the over-sea Dominions and to those of the Mother Country. It is impossible for us in these islands ever to run any risk of being swamped by an influx of coloured races. That is not at all the case in any of our over-sea possessions; and I need hardly remind your Lordships of the excitement which was caused not long ago in Canada by the threatened influx of a large number of Japanese immigrants. In Australia, which is the
<col>770</col>
most democratic portion of His Majesty's Dominions, the one feeling which unites all parties, and not least the Labour Party&#x2014;the most democratic Party in a democratic country&#x2014;is a determination to preserve Australia white, and, therefore, they cannot be expected to look at the matter otherwise than from a practical rather than from a sentimental point of view.<lb/>
Then I would ask whether it is in the interests of the coloured races themselves that the risk should be run of ruining this new-born Constitution for the sake of giving to certain coloured residents in South Africa privileges which they do not at present enjoy. As the noble Earl pointed out, this Bill takes away nothing from the coloured residents at the Cape. They are still eligible for election to the Cape Parliament, and, in addition to that, they will secure votes for the Union Parliament, although the privilege has not been conceded them of occupying seats in that Parliament. As Lord Crewe very justly said, if no coloured men have yet been elected members of the Cape Parliament, the presumption is that they will not find it easy to secure election as members of the Union Parliament. I therefore think that, in the interests of the coloured races themselves, it would be most undesirable if, to secure that dim and distant possibility, the risk were run of throwing the whole Constitution back into hotch-pot. Would it tend to promote amicable feelings between the white and coloured races if the white men were to find that through this action they had to commence their whole work over again? Moreover, what would be the effect on the relations between South Africa and the Mother Country? Surely it would create a bitter feeling if the people of South Africa were led to think that owing to the interference of the Mother Country in what they regard as a matter of local arrangement the work that they have striven so long to accomplish was suddenly undone. I would further add that in my judgment very considerable apprehensions would be excited alike in Canada and in Australia that the old days of Downing-street interference were likely again to be attempted.<lb/>
And, lastly, I would point out that at the present time a very grave moral responsibility rests upon every white race which feels it incumbent upon it to restrict in any way the rights of citizenship of their coloured fellow-subjects, and I believe
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0389"/>
<col>771</col>
that upon the whole that responsibility is acknowledged and generally acted up to by the members of our great self-governing possessions. If I thought that their hostility to coloured labour was the result of any foolish prejudice against the colour of a man's skin or was actuated solely by the fear that coloured competition would reduce the rate of wages, I should have no sympathy whatever with such feelings; but I believe that above and beyond that lies the fact that they do feel that unless their relations with their coloured fellow-subjects are very carefully regulated grave national dangers may be apprehended. That is at the bottom of their jealousy to admit the coloured races to what they regard as an excessive amount of power. I do not think your Lordships will have very much difficulty in coming to a decision in favour of the principles of the measure which has just been brought before you; and I do not speak with any pretension of convincing your Lordships, but merely because I think it is well to place on record that, in supporting the principles of the Bill as they stand, we do so having well considered the question as to whether they are not in the long run the best and the most fair and reasonable that the coloured races can be expected to obtain at our hands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01686"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to join my noble friend behind me in congratulating His Majesty's Government most heartily and unreservedly upon the introduction of this measure and upon the reception that it has met with in all parts of the country. I agree with what the noble Earl the Leader of the House said, or, at any rate, with the inference we are justified in drawing from his remarks, that the credit for this measure, if that is a point we are called upon to discuss, is to be divided between more than one Government and between many statesmen, both in this country and in South Africa. I agree that the exact proportionment of that credit is a matter not for ourselves, but for history, although when the noble Earl selected as the type of historian who is to make up our minds for us at some distant date a Froude or Macaulay of the future I am not certain that he provided us with the best guarantee for a strictly impartial verdict.<lb/>
My title to speak upon this question is a very limited one, and it is only
<col>772</col>
assumed with the utmost diffidence. It arises solely from the fact that I happened to be in South Africa in the course of last winter at a time when the draft of Union was being deliberated, and when in all parts of the country the forces were being moulded that led to the issue we are here to consummate. Everything that I then heard from the spokesmen of public opinion in South Africa as to the hopeful chances of this measure, even though it was thought by some to be optimistic at the time, has been entirely justified by the results; and I do not think that the most confident anticipations that were made in South Africa and re-echoed in this country have at all exceeded or exaggerated the realities of the case.<lb/>
It is indubitable that this Union represents not any conspiracy or combination&#x2014;however honourable such conspiracy or combination might be&#x2014;of the leading politicians of South Africa, but that it springs from the deliberate and settled convictions of the vast majority of the European population, at any rate, of that part of the Empire. It is not a measure that has been pushed forward with any undue degree of haste, and most certainly its progress has not been accelerated by any pressure from outside. When we remember that it has passed through the ordeal of the Local Parliaments in South Africa, that it has run the gauntlet of all the constituencies there for months, and that it has twice been debated and passed by a Convention of the leading statesmen of that country, we may form an idea of the degree of support that is behind it. It comes to us with an authority which, I believe, has never attended any document of the same character in the history of the British Empire. The Government of Great Britain has given constitutions sometimes to willing and sometimes to unwilling and suspicious recipients. But assuredly it has never given its sanction to a constitutional experiment which has been to so great an extent the product of local conditions or that has so well expressed the Colonial will.<lb/>
I desire entirely to identify myself with the argument of the noble Earl and also of the noble Lord behind me as to the superior advantages, in the circumstances of the case, of union over federation. Lord Rosebery the other day, in the course of a famous speech, appeared to congratulate
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0390"/>
<col>773</col>
the Australian Commonwealth on the evidence of virility which it possesses in being able to maintain seven separate Constitutions and Governments. Whatever may be the case in Australia, South Africa does not appear to me to have the numbers, even if it has the vigour, to support four. Unity of system in respect of railways, Customs, Imperial defence, and statute law must be a source of great strength to the future administration of South Africa. It will be of immense advantage, as matters develop, to have a national land settlement policy, a national immigration policy, a national labour policy, and, if the forecast is not too Utopian, a national native policy also. Whether a single Government will be able in the remote future to cope with the difficulties of controlling and administering territories so extended and so enlarged as these are likely one day to be need not concern us now. What we have to do, and what His Majesty's Government is doing in this Bill, is to provide the most potent and effective governing instrument for the needs of the hour.<lb/>
The degree to which the centre of political gravity in South Africa has changed and is changing could not be better illustrated than by the tone of this debate. The real issue is no longer one between British and Dutch. That is an issue that has gone by and been submerged; as we hope never again to be revived. In so far as any racial issue at all occupies our consideration it is not one between British and Dutch, but between the Europeans and the different tribes and sections of natives. The important part that is played by this question in our deliberations is sufficiently indicated by the proportion, I think amounting to nearly two-thirds, of the speech of the noble Earl the Leader of the House which was devoted to that subject, and it is almost the only part of the Bill about which I am at all anxiously concerned, and upon which I am, perhaps, in some small measure entitled to express an opinion, owing to the fact that in another part of the Empire I have been concerned with different evolutions of the same problem&#x2014;namely, the management and control of native peoples.<lb/>
I do not complain of the attitude which has been taken up by the advocates of
<col>774</col>
what are called native rights. That attitude seems to me to be both honourable to them and reasonable in its character. Whether we regard the question of the native protectorates or the question of the exercise of the franchise by natives it is pre-eminently incumbent on both Houses of Parliament to safeguard the interests and protect the future of the native communities committed to our charge. The question assumes a two-fold aspect. There is the question of the Protectorates in South Africa, the native populations in which I believe amount to about 600,000 souls. There is no doubt that the chiefs and the peoples in those Protectorates have regarded, and, I dare say, still regard, with very great and not altogether unnatural apprehension the change in their political <i>status</i> that is involved in the Union. They attach supreme importance to their direct rule by the Crown and by the representative of the Crown in South Africa. They have found their political independence guaranteed, their ownership of the soil secured, and their personal liberties safeguarded by that system, and in simple and rather moving language they protest&#x2014;as we have read lately in the Press&#x2014;against any change. It is true also that Colonial Governments have not always been successful in the past in their dealings with native Protectorates or in their management of native questions. Further I agree with the remark of the noble Earl opposite that Parliamentary rule is not the form of administration best adapted to solve the difficult and critical issues involved in native questions. Nevertheless, I unreservedly agree with the conclusions at which the Government have arrived. I do not see how it would be possible permanently or in the remote future to contemplate a system of dual control in South Africa, a system under which the native population, in the self-governing States, who, I believe number about 4,500,000, would be under the local Governments, while the small minority of 600,000 natives in the Protectorates would be under another <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> administered and controlled from Great Britain.<lb/>
I listened with appreciation and respect to the cautious and statesmanlike language of the noble Earl on this subject. I hope that the process of transferring the Protectrates to the Union will not be sudden, abrupt, or violent, but gradual and slow, and that it will be accompanied by scrupulous
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0391"/>
<col>775</col>
regard for the feelings, desires, and conventions of the inhabitants. Many of your Lordships must have looked with great interest and care upon the contents of the Schedule of this Bill. I confess that to me the Schedule is almost the most important part of the measure, and I was glad to learn from the noble Earl that it had been introduced in its somewhat unusual form here to meet the express desire of the chiefs and peoples of the Protectorates themselves. From a perusal of the contents of the Schedule I think your Lordships may feel satisfied that the guarantees given for the preservation of the land rights of the inhabitants of the Protectorates, for the restriction of the liquor traffic, and in respect of taxation are adequate, and that the form of administration which the Government propose to set up is, on the whole, the most satisfactory that could be devised for the purpose.<lb/>
Now I pass to another aspect of the native question which filled so large a portion of the speech of the noble Earl. I refer to that aspect of the case which relates to the political rights and the franchise enjoyed by the natives. Here, I think, it cannot be denied that in two respects the situation appears to be, though I hope it is not, worse as a result of this Bill. As the noble Earl told us, whereas there is under the existing constitution in South Africa nothing to prevent a native in Cape Colony from standing for, or being elected to, the Cape Parliament, under the Act of Union natives will be excluded altogether from standing for or sitting in the Parliament of the Union. I observe that in a letter to <i>The Times</i> this morning Mr. Schreiner, a very able and convinced exponent of the native case, draws attention to the fact that this opportunity enjoyed by the natives in Cape Colony has never been abused. It is quite true that it has never been abused, but it has never been abused because it has never been exercised or enjoyed. The noble Earl said that no native had ever been elected to the Cape Parliament, but I think it is true also that no native has ever stood or solicited the suffrages of the constituencies.<lb/>
Here again, I am in sympathy with the noble Earl. On abstract grounds I regret very much this provision. I regret the exclusion of natives in South Africa from the privilege of standing for and being returned to the Parliament of the Union; but I think that the Government, particularly
<col>776</col>
after the explanation given by the noble Earl to-night, were perfectly right not to assume the responsibility of insisting on any such measure. The noble Earl told us in the clearest language that had they so insisted they might have wrecked the Union and that would have been a very serious and very perilous step to take. I doubt whether any Government in the same position would have acted otherwise. Moreover, even if the Union were not menaced, was it in the least likely that, simply because the Cape, whose policy with regard to natives has always been more advanced and generous, decided, I think half a century ago, to admit natives to their Parliament, which, it must be remembered, was only a local Parliament, the other self-governing States of South Africa, who had never given this privilege at all, would, on the basis of that analogy, have extended it over the whole area of South Africa, not for a local Parliament, but for the great Union Parliament?<lb/>
The second point on which there appears to be some loss of privilege is with regard to the political franchise and political rights. Under the Bill of Union we know that the franchise enjoyed by the natives in Cape Colony can be taken away by the vote of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of Parliament sitting in session together. I listened with interest to what fell from the noble Earl on this point, and here again I thought he was right. The prospect, the fear that any such thing may take place is one of which I at any rate am not at all alarmed. I cannot believe it to be in the least likely that public opinion in South Africa or in this country would allow of any such deprivation. Rather I should hope that public opinion in South Africa will steadily move in the opposite and more liberal direction in the future. Again, your Lordships cannot fail to have been impressed by the serious language used by the noble Earl in this connection, in which he not obscurely indicated that if any such measure were presented at a future date to His Majesty's advisers they would not be oblivious of the fact that they have the power of veto.<lb/>
I think, therefore, that over the field of action covered by the noble Earl the natives of South Africa cannot be said to have lost anything substantial. It would have been impossible either for the Union statesmen in South Africa or for His Majesty's Government to go further than they have
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0392"/>
<col>777</col>
done. If there is a single question I imagine on which it is impossible for Governments or statesmen to march in advance of public opinion it is in respect of racial issues. As we all know, they excite the most heated passions and produce the most profound social and moral fissures. We may deplore that public opinion in South Africa or anywhere else has not reached the precise point of advancement to which we, with our greater irresponsibility and often with our superior ignorance, have attained, but the real line in all such matters is not to force public opinion up to your level, but to wait until it reaches the point you have attained yourselves.<lb/>
This brings me to the only other remark that I wish to make, and that is that the main, or one of the main, justifications of the Union of South Africa appears to me to be the splendid mental and moral discipline that it will provide for the whole of the South African community. We shall see there the evolution of a national consciousness, and&#x2014;I hope the remark may not be considered an invidious one&#x2014;the growth and development of a national conscience in all these matters. Whereas, under a system of four Governments, separated to some extent from each other by petty squabbles and the somewhat narrow and selfish interests of the various communities, you could have nothing of the sort, under a single and powerful Government you will have a new national sense growing up in South Africa. You will produce large and broad-minded statesmen who will take a wide rather than the petty and narrower view both of local and Imperial affairs. And if as time goes on this process of intellectual and moral expansion is accompanied, as I hope it may be, by an increasing amalgamation of the races and the two peoples inter-marry and reproduce all the best qualities of both, then, my Lords, I believe that this Bill will be not only the dawn of a new era in South Africa, but will prove a positive and most important landmark in the history of the civilised world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01687"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we must all be impressed with the gravity of the situation in which we find ourselves. We are accepting from South Africa the draft scheme for the union of the hitherto separated Colonial Governments of that country, and we are setting on foot something which, in the
<col>778</col>
words of the noble Lord who has just sat down, we may hope will develop a national mind, a national conscience, and a national policy, especially in respect of native affairs. We are bound probably to accept on almost every question which is submitted to us the opinion of those who have been engaged in the formation of this Act of Union, in view of the great issues which, as Lord Curzon has pointed out, are involved. But having regard to the fact that in respect of a great class of questions those who have been engaged in the formation of this union were not representatives of, and in no case entitled to speak for, those for whom they were legislating, we are bound, I think, to offer some opinion, even if we abstain from going the length of attempting to enforce our opinion when we find it different from the conclusions arrived at in South Africa. My own prepossession is entirely to accept with little question what has been brought to us.<lb/>
As my noble friend who introduced this Bill has told you, this is not the first time that a proposal for the establishment of a united Government for South Africa has been brought before Parliament. More than thirty years ago a scheme for the confederation of South Africa was submitted to Parliament and ultimately became law. That was very early in my political life, but I took&#x2014;it may be known to some of your Lordships&#x2014;a rather resolute stand in opposition to that project, which became ultimately abortive because it was never put into operation. But my chief ground for opposition, and one of the main principles on which I proceeded, was that that union did not come from South Africa and was not conceived in any just relation to the circumstances that then prevailed in South Africa. The present Bill does come from South Africa and is founded upon an intimate knowledge of the circumstances of that country; and it comes to us with the authority of a happy union of the most distinguished men, both Dutch and British, who have been engaged for years past in the government of South Africa. Every principle, therefore, which led me to resist the former Bill leads me to accept, with deference, what is here submitted to us. The provisions relating to questions concerning the relations of the different white populations of South Africa to one another and the provisions which deal with
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0393"/>
<col>779</col>
the formation of a European or a European-descended community in South Africa command my entire concurrence and respect. But when the representatives of the European communities there go further and lay down principles which shall govern the organisation of South Africa in the future with regard to the overwhelming black population, then I think we may be entitled to question their authority; and if we do not go the length of pressing our opinions on their acceptance, we may at least state them and invite their consideration under aspects which, perhaps, have not previously occurred.<lb/>
The two main points to which I would like to call attention are the denying of the eligibility of the native to sit either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives of the South African Parliament and the taking over of the Protectorates by the future Government of South Africa. Both the noble Earl who introduced this Bill and the noble Lord who spoke last expressed regret that the native should not be eligible to sit in the Parliament of South Africa; but it was pointed out by both of them that this was a new question not governed by what had pre-existed. Lord Curzon said it is very difficult to press upon an unwilling local population any principle which they strongly resent, and that you are bound to defer to the authority of those on the spot. The argument of the noble Earl who brought in the Bill and the argument of the noble Lord who has just sat down would be very strong if it were necessary to choose between the eligibility of non-European-descended persons to sit in the United Parliament for all constituencies under all circumstances, and their to sit for Cape constituencies or to sit in the Senate. In maintaining their eligibility for Cape constituencies you would be practically maintaining what exists, and it would not have been necessary to insist that they should have been eligible for election as representatives of the Transvaal or the Orange Free State, where they are not now eligible, or as representatives of Natal, where they are eligible but under such conditions that it would be impossible to dream of their being elected. It is not necessary to have a universal eligibility. It would have been quite sufficient and consistent with what has gone before if you maintained the eligibility of natives as representatives of Cape constituencies.<lb/>
<col>780</col>
Was there any invincible obstacle to that eligibility being maintained? We are told that if any such change had been insisted upon it would have broken up the scheme of the Union. I do not find, however, that that statement is made with respect to this partial eligibility on which I have dwelt. It is made in respect to universal eligibility. Would, it have been impossible to have maintained the <i>status quo</i> in regard to eligibility in Cape Colony? I am not clear from any statement that has been made that such a provision would have involved anything like the destruction of the Union. I would go further and say that, from conversations I have had and from communications which have been made to me, I think that this difficulty was in a large measure unreal. I am at all events not convinced,&#x2014;perhaps a desire not to be convinced leads to the conclusion, but I do not think so&#x2014;that if a quiet resolution had been maintained on the part of the representatives of the King to insist upon the retention of the eligibility, however theoretical that may be, of the natives for election for Cape constituencies, such a resolution would not have prevailed. Indeed, there are reasons for thinking that even in the Transvaal and in the Orange Free State the objection to the possibility of a native member sitting with other members in the united Parliament of the future was not as great as has been represented.<lb/>
Let me recall to your memory a circumstance which I think illustrates this. Before representative institutions were granted to the new Colonies and whilst the Transvaal was still administered as a Crown Colony, there was a Commission appointed to inquire into the government of the natives, and that Commission held an elaborate inquiry and presented an ample Report. It has not led to any practical conclusions, and I do not think, indeed, that the mind of the Commission was so decisive as to produce any legislative consequence. But it is a remarkable fact that in the course of their Report great stress is laid upon the possibility of maintaining native representation in any future Parliamentary institutions that might be set up in South Africa by following the New Zealand pattern, where, as your Lordships know, native Maories elect four Maori members to sit in the New Zealand House of Representatives. There
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0394"/>
<col>781</col>
was no kind of repulsion expressed as to the possibility of admitting a similar system in South Africa&#x2014;that is to say, the idea of admitting one, two, or three native members, elected by the natives to sit in the Union Parliament, was not at once rejected as absolutely inadmissible. Thus the aversion to possible co-operation in this way of natives with those of European descent in the future government of the country is so far shown to be something which you might grapple with and dispel. Is there any solid reason why a stronger line should not have been taken with respect to this question of eligibility? It was stated by my noble friend below me, and repeated by Lord Curzon, that no native presented himself for election, and, therefore, that no native had ever been elected to the Cape Assembly. That is perfectly true; but eligibility is not a matter of merely sentimental consideration, as was suggested by the noble Lord who spoke second this evening. It is a matter which concerns those who take a very practical view of this problem.<lb/>
What is the problem, after all? The great problem of the future is the government of the natives by the whites, and how they should be associated in the organisation of South Africa. Now, what are the circumstances with respect to the natives in relation to the problem? The native is increasing in numbers and shows a remarkable aptitude for education, insomuch that some of them are occupying honourable positions in the liberal professions; others are engaged in trade, and a larger number every year are going through the practical education which lies in the industrial development of the community. You have some 20,000 native voters in Cape Colony; you have native barristers, native doctors, native editors, native preachers; and it is a most practical question not to stifle the aspirations which we find in the minds of those natives, and which will become stronger and stronger with their progress and development, but to allow the possibility, even though it may not become immediately active, of these natives passing up and going from a position of members of a subject race to a position of equality with the superior race in the government of the country. If you really wish to get a national conscience, if you wish to get a national mind, could you secure better contributions to the magnificent thing you desire than by the co-operation,
<col>782</col>
in however feeble a manner and however slight a degree, of native action with your own in the Government in the future?<lb/>
There were some observations made by Lord Curzon which lead me to think that he agrees with me in this respect, that in the remote future there must and will be such an association of the educated natives with the whites as I have been sketching. When you have got, as even under this Bill, native electors in the Cape; when you have got, as even under this Bill, natives eligible to be elected to the provincial committees of the Cape, do you think that even a South African Parliament could permanently withstand the admission of natives to sit in the House of Representatives if sent there by a Cape constituency? Our own experience leads to the conclusion that ineligibility of that kind could not be maintained in the circumstances of an election taking place such as I have suggested. You had a law prohibiting Catholics sitting in the House of Commons but when the people of Clare sent Mr. O'Connor there, the Duke of Wellington did not think it wise to face the possibility of a civil war in Ireland and the disability was removed. I have no doubt that this ineligibility will be removed, but I do not desire that it should be removed as the result of severe contention, or of strife which may take a material shape. Do not take away eligibility because it has not been exercised; allow it to remain since it involves no serious danger. It gives the possibility of the building up of that society in South Africa in the future in which alone can we hope to find a stable, a progressive, a civilised nation.<lb/>
I am unwilling even for a moment to refer to a matter which may be regarded as peculiar to myself, but I think the case for maintaining the eligibility of the native is much stronger because of the unfortunate removal from the final draft of the South Africa Act of that principle of proportional representation which was embodied in it at first. Having regard only to the composition of the white communities there, it was most desirable that in the Parliament of the future there should be found representatives of every shade of moderate opinion; that there should emerge from the Boer community, so to speak, men who would be more in agreement with the English and would have sympathies and
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0395"/>
<col>783</col>
affinities leading them to understand their ways of thought, and that from amidst the English communities there should emerge those having affinities and sympathies with the Boers&#x2014;that you should get the man of moderate opinion, free from the folly of extremes, who should carry forward that steady, sober, persistent and well-maintained course of moderate policy which is found in the happy circumstances under which this Act of Union has been framed, by bringing the representatives of both parties together, but which is always in danger of lapsing under Parliamentary institutions such as we usually understand them. It is pre-eminently desirable that this principle should have been kept in the Union in the interests of the natives, because in the absence of it I am afraid there may be great difficulty in anybody who is dubbed a negrophile finding it possible to obtain access to the united Parliament.<lb/>
I put it to your Lordships as a matter of practical wisdom, not as a matter of sentiment. If you go to the root of the matter and consider what is practical and wise, if you take into account the composition of the population and the proved improvability of the native races, if you take into account the way in which they have raised themselves and are raising themselves, you see that it will be impossible to maintain the position assumed in this Bill, and it would have been better at the outset to have allowed this question of eligibility to remain open as it was in the past, and to have left to the Parliament of South Africa its development in the future. When we get into Committee I shall feel it my duty to put before your Lordships a proposition for removing from the Bill the clauses requiring that all Senators and members of the House of Representatives should be of European descent. I do not quite know, by the by, what that expression means. There is no definition of it in the Bill, and it would be interesting to know what proportion of blood renders a person European. But whatever it may be, if this disqualification were removed, then the eligibility of natives for the united Parliament would remain the same as for the present separated Parliaments, so that, in fact, in the Cape a native would be eligible, in the Transvaal and Orange Free State he would be ineligible, and in Natal he would be theoretically eligible though
<col>784</col>
practically ineligible. The simple removal of the disqualification clause would leave things as they are.<lb/>
One strong reason in favour of the removal is that it would operate as a means of enabling the gradual working up of the great populations of South Africa into a position to take some share, however small, in the government of the country. It may appear to many of you fanciful to think that in maintaining this eligibility we should have any kind of prospect of welding the populations of South Africa together. But the fact that any man may look forward to being in Parliament is a circumstance which is of the profoundest influence in the organisation of society among ourselves, and in South Africa, too, it would tend to make society one. This eligibility I repeat is a thing which ought to be cherished if we really wish to build up a society which will hold together as one society in Africa.<lb/>
I pass to the other matter on which I wish to make a few observations. It will be said, and has been said, with respect to what I have been already speaking about, that it is idle to make a proposition for removing the clause in question because it is vital to the Act of Union and could not be removed. But with respect to the taking over of the Protectorates we have, as I understand from the noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal, an admission that that emanated from us, that the Clause and the Schedule attached are home-grown, that they are not of Smith African formation, and that although the delegates are ready to accept them they are not brought forward by them, and, indeed, there is a rumour, which may or may not be accurate, that when it was suggested that items in the Schedule might be strengthened the members of the Convention were ready to accept them as they stood but would prefer to have them dropped altogether than altered. But they are not averse to having them dropped altogether. It is, therefore, within our competence to strike out the provision relating to the taking over of the Protectorates. I cannot help thinking that it is very desirable that that should be done, and I would almost claim the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, as a supporter in that. He wishes that the Protectorates should be taken over slowly, that there should be delay and due weight paid to all representations made by those concerned;
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0396"/>
<col>785</col>
and though he admitted that the thing must be done, he was in favour of its being done later rather than sooner.<lb/>
I admit quite frankly that these Protectorates must at some future day be taken over by the Government of South Africa. It is impossible to conceive that they should remain apart from that Government, intermixed as the Protectorates are with the area which will be governed by the South African Parliament, but it need not be done at once. If the clause were omitted there would be this great advantage, that when the transfer of a Protectorate was proposed the conditions would have to be examined anew by the Home Parliament, and this circumstance would be of extreme value, because we should have more opportunity for deliberation and preparation. If we cannot do that, we might at least attach some conditions to the transfer which are not found in the Bill at present. I would remind your Lordships that, although it may be argued with almost irresistible force that you could not deal with the non-eligibility of the native to sit as a member even for the Cape in the House of Representatives, you are perfectly at liberty to deal with this question of the transfer of Protectorates.<lb/>
Now, are the clauses in the Schedule dealing with this subject really as trustworthy as seem to be thought by my noble friend below me and as was accepted by the noble Lord who spoke last? What do they amount to? They really amount to nothing more than this, that the Protectorates should be under the Parliamentary Government of the Cape in future. Examine them quite narrowly, and you will see that all the precautions that are supposed to be involved in these clauses are of a very shadowy and unsubstantial nature. The transferred Protectorate is to be under the government of the Prime Minister. Who is the Prime Minister? He is the man enjoying the confidence of the House of Representatives at the Cape. The laws and regulations are to be made by the Governor-General in Council. Who is the Governor-General in Council? The Governor-General is not an independent authority like the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General in Council in the future will be a Constitutional monarch, and the Governor-General in Council is another name for the authority of the Prime Minister. These regulations and laws have to be submitted as Provisional
<col>786</col>
Orders to the Parliament, and again you have the concurrence and the co-operation of Parliament. You have the whole of the administration of the transferred territory practically under the control of Parliament. It is true that there are to be certain gentlemen appointed as advisers of the Prime Minister, and they are to have a certain fixed tenure of office and fixed remuneration. They will be chosen, however, by the Prime Minister in the first place, and they will naturally be chosen in a way not to present opposition to him. More than that, the Prime Minister, although he is bound to present to his advisers any new scheme of legislation or of taxation, is not bound to accept their conclusion; and although when they dissent they have a right to record their dissent, the Prime Minister&#x2014;the Prime Minister again&#x2014;with the concurrence of his colleagues, can determine that the publication of the dissent would be opposed to good policy and injudicious in the circumstances of the situation, and the dissent could in that way be suppressed. So that the guarantees that are supposed to be involved in this separate administration are, as I have said, of a very shadowy character.<lb/>
Even the safeguards supposed to be derived in the case of India are wanting in respect of these Protectorates. The great mass of our members have no special knowledge of or interest in India, and there is no legislation with respect to India which they desire to promote for any ends of their own. But take the case of the Protectorates of Bechuanaland and Basutoland. They are close to the electors and close to the members of the Cape Parliament. The eyes of many of the constituents are directed to the lands contained within those Protectorates. They have very plausible arguments for saying that if these lands were taken under their control there would be plenty to allow the natives and the rest might be turned to better use&#x2014;might, in fact, be made the means of developing a large European society. These temptations of interference in the administration of the Protectorates do not prevail in respect of British India and therefore the safeguards which you think you derive from the analogy of British India are wanting in respect of the Protectorates of Bechuanaland and Basutoland.<lb/>
There is one other consideration I desire to present to you. We are bound in respect
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0397"/>
<col>787</col>
of Basutoland, for instance, in the most clear fashion by promises of a very deliberate and unmistakable character to give the Basutos the benefit of direct government from home. State Papers amounting to a contract exist, for Lord Derby's great Despatch of 1883 guaranteed to Basutoland direct government from home. I admit that all these declarations, whether contained in treaties, conventions, or other State documents, cannot be regarded as being perpetually binding as eternal obligations. They must be construed with reference to the circumstances in which they are given and the circumstances in which they are sought to be applied; and I admit that, despite Lord Derby's solemn assurance amounting to a promise, a case may arise and must arise when Basutoland would be handed over from the direct authority of the Crown to the control of the Parliament of South Africa. But the members of His Majesty's Government must be very slow to take that liberal view of the way in which conventions and treaties can be manipulated. At all events, their language in recent months has led them to look upon all such negotiations as matters which cannot be changed, and they may agree with me in thinking that they must not be changed until the proposed changes have been communicated to those interested in them, until those interested have had a right to speak upon them and to make out any case they may desire to make in opposition to them. If the Schedule and the Clause are retained, they should at least secure that no transfer should be made of a Protectorate from the direct control of the Crown to the Government of South Africa until the indunas had been collected together and the circumstances explained to them, until they had had an opportunity of expressing their opinions, until they could, if necessity arose, send representatives to appeal to the King in Council not to sanction the transfer. That is the simplest and most natural way of protecting a right which is acknowledged to exist, and which should not be changed except under the most cogent considerations demanding a change.<lb/>
I see no difficulty about inserting provisions requiring that these securities shall be realised before any transfer is made. It is admitted that the inhabitants of Basutoland and Bechuanaland implore you not to make the change. Well, do not be in a hurry to make it. Do not insist on its being done soon. Let time elapse before it is done.
<col>788</col>
Remove the power from this Bill, and let it come up again before Parliament. But if you persist in maintaining the machinery in the Bill then at least improve that machinery by securing to the people most affected the right of remonstrance and of presenting their case. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Northcote, spoke of this Act of Union as part of a great measure of Imperial relations. The primary object to be considered is what shall be the relation of this Act to the people of South Africa. Imperial relations will follow in due course; but no Imperial relations can be sound unless you have a united, a self-reliant, a self-conscious, a vivified community. If you have only a small proportion, relatively, of European descent governing a vast mass of coloured population you will have a position of unrest, of instability, and of future danger such as would not make South Africa a sound element in your Imperial Union. You must in some measure or other admit the possibility of co-operation between native and white if you would make South Africa a united part in the union of Imperial Britain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01688"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: I desire to say a very few words on this subject, and I shall not detain your Lordships for more than a few minutes. I feel deeply the responsibility of uttering any word which savours, I will not say of objection, but even of serious criticism of a Bill which is fraught not merely with the power of effacing so many of the memories of strife in the past, but also with the possibility of opening the gates of high hope for the future. I am a grateful and glad supporter, with the rest of your Lordships, of the Motion for the Second Reading of this Bill, and, more than that, I am ready, in all the circumstances, that the Bill should stand upon the Statute Book without amendment of any kind. The noble Earl who introduced the Bill to-night so eloquently, spoke in his opening words of the fact that what we are doing closes a chapter in South African history; and he went on to say, to my great satisfaction, that it opens a chapter as well. I regard these as words of good omen, for the chapter which is opening may, I trust, unroll a story of progress and advance in more ways than one.<lb/>
But there is one matter to which every speaker has referred and which cuts so
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0398"/>
<col>789</col>
deep into the principles upon which the central legislation of a great Empire ought to rest, that, sitting where I do, I should find it difficult to pass it by in silence, or rather to pass it by as though we acquiesced in this proposal, at a juncture like the present, as something essentially and fundamentally right. I refer, of course, to the racial or colour bar which cuts across the path of certain men. Whatever their gifts and whatever their educational and other qualifications for the responsible discharge of the functions of a citizen, or even for high office, these men are to be debarred on the ground simply and solely of the racial or colour distinction. The calm consideration of the racial question is always apt to be hindered by excessive sentiment on the one side or by violent prejudice on the other, and I am very far from contending either that the question is an easy one or that those are to be censured who, either in South Africa or in England, are responsible for the Bill as it stands.<lb/>
Again, I would not say a word which might seem to imply that I thought we had, reached a stage at which the native races in South Africa could be placed as regards the functions of citizenship on a par with the white men. The overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa must for some generations to come be regarded, I am afraid, as quite unfit for any such charge or responsibility. I gather that what is here proposed is not in the least likely to do any harm at this moment to any appreciable portion of the native races. The greatest danger, I suppose, of all to which we could expose the native cause would be that the privilege of the franchise should fall into the hands of natives who are obviously unfit to exercise it. But in case we should hereafter be regarded as having acquiesced in laying it down as a permanent principle that there is to be a bar against certain men, whatever their other qualifications, on the mere ground of race or colour, we must to-night make our position clear. To say that would be saying what to some of us is not merely against the grain, but traverses principles of a very sacred kind. Noble Lords have to-night used the phrase "native franchise," but the words in the Bill are "of European descent." I believe there has been no judicial interpretation of these words. We can imagine an interpretation which might carry us very far indeed. I should be out of my depth if I discussed that matter, but I think it is well we
<col>790</col>
should bear in mind where these words may possibly lead us, and what effect their rigid application may have upon the position of many who now possess an unchallenged franchise or a seat in Parliament. I fee so strongly about the principle which is at stake in regard to this colour bar that I should greatly have liked to hear that it had been possible, in South Africa, to take a different line from that which has been adopted. As at present advised, I should be sorry to try to force Amendments upon the Bill as it stands, for the very plain reason that, <i>pace</i> Lord Courtney, I am given to understand that such an Amendment would, be fatal to the Bill and that the dropping of the Bill would be in the highest degree harmful, not only to the general well-being of South Africa, but specially to the native cause in South Africa, and that by wrecking the Bill we should be defeating the very object we have at heart.<lb/>
The principle on which I suppose that we may fall back in this matter was laid down in an eloquent address delivered to the University of the Cape in a perfectly private capacity by the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, to whom South Africa owes so much. He laid down in that address, speaking, he tells us, not as High Commissioner, but as a graduate of one University addressing another University, that what we have to remember in our dealings with the natives in South Africa is that we are the adults and they are the children. The white man, he points out, is the racial adult: the black man is the racial child. That principle runs through all that is best and most desirable in the legislation we may lay down. On that principle it is that I desire to base the hopes I entertain that good may come out of what is to many of us an apparent evil. If we clearly realise that the restrictions and limitations which are for the present imposed on so many of our fellow-subjects are restrictions and limitations which correspond to those which we impose on children, or growing boys, in our own land, and that they will grow up and that the time will come when they will be fit to discharge all the responsibilities we withhold from them at present, we may look forward to the future without the alarm which this provision would otherwise cause us. We believe that what we regard as the larger, sounder, and more Christian principles will in the long run
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0399"/>
<col>791</col>
prevail in South Africa as years advance. I have been glad to notice, as Lord Curzon has already said, that whereas under the Bill any endeavour to restrict the rights given by the Bill to the natives must be supported by a two-thirds majority of the Assembly, the privileges can by a bare majority be extended freely in more directions than one. That seems to me to strike a hopeful note, and corresponds with the satisfaction with which we are able, on the whole, to welcome what I believe to be a measure of a wise and beneficent character, and likely to tend to the good of the whole peoples of South Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01689"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if this debate is not prolonged further into the evening, and if the closing speeches are addressed to somewhat sparsely filled Benches, I trust it will not be believed that that is because there exists in any part of the House anything like a feeling of indifference to the Bill before us. We recognise, on the contrary, its vast importance to the Colonies concerned most immediately and to the Empire as a whole.<lb/>
But this Bill comes to us in somewhat special circumstances. We are not asked to consider this evening the draft or the outline of a new system which is to be submitted to these Colonies and afterwards brought back to us for final consideration. What we have before us to-night is a carefully-elaborated scheme for the creation of a new Constitution in South Africa&#x2014;a scheme which comes to us backed by the responsible Governments of the four Colonies concerned and, so far as we are able to judge, by the people of those Colonies. We therefore on this side of the House not only do not approach the question in anything like a critical spirit, but we realise that, as the Secretary of State for the Colonies told us earlier in the evening, it is most important that this Bill should pass through Parliament without anything approaching serious alteration. For that reason our discussion this evening has been necessarily of a somewhat academic character. If we are to give self-government to these Colonies, surely it is clear that it is not for us, at any rate as regards matters of detail, to tell them how they are to exercise the rights which we confer upon them. To do so would be to sow the seeds of future trouble, and to assume responsibilities which I do not think we ought to undertake.<lb/>
<col>792</col>
Therefore we have to ask ourselves with regard to this Bill the simple questions&#x2014;Is it a good Bill for the Colonies? Is it a good Bill for the Empire? I think we may safely answer both those questions in the affirmative; and it does seem to me to be established by what has passed to-night that union is good for South Africa, not only because, as the noble Earl told us, without union economical administration would be impossible, not only because without union a sound railway system would be unattainable, but because without union it would be impossible for these communities to found stable institutions and to create that wider patriotism of which signs have already been manifested during the negotiations which led to the framing of this measure. Therefore, I say unhesitatingly that I, for one, regard this Bill as a great achievement on which I offer His Majesty's Government my sincere congratulations. It is an achievement which would have been creditable in any circumstances. It is an achievement which seems to me doubly creditable when we remember that within the present decade we were locked in a deadly struggle with some of those who have acted most energetically and most cordially in bringing about this great settlement.<lb/>
When I say that, I wish to guard myself against being supposed to suggest that this, in our opinion, is in all respects a perfect measure. I do not believe for a moment that it will solve all the problems which lie before us in South Africa, and I do not believe that those who have been most responsible for framing the Bill would themselves claim that it is a measure of that kind. But taking the Bill, as we must, as a whole, I regard it as a justification of the expeditious procedure which His Majesty's Government preferred to the more deliberate policy which found favour with their predecessors.<lb/>
The noble Earl observed that the point with regard to which most anxiety is felt in this House is the manner in which the Bill deals with the political rights of the non-European part of the South African population. As to what I conceive to be the main principle on which His Majesty's Government have proceeded in this respect I have not a word of complaint to offer. I understand them to found themselves as far as possible on the recognition of the <i>status quo</i>. That seems to me to be a reasonable proposal.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0400"/>
<col>793</col>
The question of native rights is one which for generations has distracted South Africa, and it would have been impossible to attempt in this settlement to substitute for the anomalous and inconsistent arrangements which now obtain in different parts of His Majesty's South African Dominions anything like a uniform or symmetrical arrangement. To have attempted any task of the kind would only have over-weighted the Convention and might well have led to its complete failure.<lb/>
I cannot, however, refrain from saying that there are points in regard to which considerable anxiety is felt by those who are interested in these matters. There is, in the first place, the general and sweeping exclusion of all persons not of European descent from the right to sit in the Union Parliament. That broad exclusion has come, I have no doubt, to many people as a very considerable shock. The noble Earl evidently felt that, for I think he told us that in his opinion it was necessary to make a very strong case for such an exclusion. The most rev. Primate who has just spoken has called attention to the ambiguity of the expression "European descent." That is a question which I will not pursue at this moment, but it is quite clear that a great deal depends upon the interpretation which it is intended to give to those two words. But apart from that ambiguity, the wholesale exclusion of non-Europeans undoubtedly seems a somewhat striking and unsatisfactory feature. There is only one answer to that objection, and it is the answer which in effect the noble Earl gave when he told us that without this condition the Bill would not have been attainable at all. If that be the case, as I have no doubt it is, much as I regret the insertion of these words, I very much prefer the Bill with the exclusion to no Bill at all. Then there is the special hardship occasioned to Cape Colony. The non-European residents of Cape Colony are at this moment qualified to sit in the Legislature of Cape Colony. They retain the right, but they are not eligible for a seat in the Union Parliament. I do not press that objection very hard. It seems to me that the arguments which apply in the case of qualification for a local Parliament do not necessarily apply where you are dealing with the Parliament of the whole Union. Moreover, even in Cape Colony there has been, I think we were told, no instance in which a person not of European origin has been allowed to sit in the Legislature.<lb/>
<col>794</col>
Then just a word, with regard to a point which has been taken by more than one speaker&#x2014;the question whether under this Bill there is really anything like adequate security for the retention of the franchise by the citizens of Cape Colony. The noble Earl was confident that the two-thirds majority was a sufficient safeguard. I frankly confess I am not quite so easily reassured. It does seem to me by no means inconceivable that circumstances might arise in which that two-thirds majority might not prove a sufficient safeguard. As I understand the figures, a two-thirds majority would mean 108 votes out of 161. Of those votes I understand ninety-four would be drawn from the Transvaal, the Orange River State, and Natal, in which it is notorious that the feeling is against the native franchise. If that figure is correct it would follow that only fourteen additional votes would be necessary in order to provide the two-thirds majority under which these people might find themselves disfranchised. That does seem to me to be a serious risk, and I think the noble Earl must be aware that it is a serious risk, because he told the House that in his view the remedy for such a state of things would probably be found in disallowance by the Imperial Government of the statute in which that disqualification was embodied. Disallowance of a Dominion statute by the Imperial Government is not a light matter, and I should be sorry to look forward to the use of that particular safeguard. I do not desire to press that point further. I would only say that I am very glad that this point has been fully discussed in this House, and that the noble Earl himself, by his language, should have showed that he realised how grave the question was, and that this right, now enjoyed by the people of Cape Colony, was not one of which they ought, in any circumstances to which we can look forward, to be deprived.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I feel that these are really not questions which we can dispose of in this house. We must look forward for a satisfactory solution of them to the same patriotism, the same love of fair play, and the same Imperial instincts which have characterised the discussion of this measure in South Africa, and we may, I hope, be confident that those qualities will be displayed again. Meanwhile we welcome this Bill both on its merits and because it is the outcome of negotiations
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0401"/>
<col>795</col>
in which these great qualities have been so repeatedly manifested. I regard the Bill as full of hopeful augury for the future. May I be permitted in passing to say that I was glad the noble Earl rather went out of his way to mention the manner in which the people of Natal had responded when the <i>referendum</i> was submitted to them? It was a very remarkable exhibition of disinterested and patriotic conduct. We gladly join noble Lords opposite in doing honour to the statesmen to whom this happy solution is due. I would gladly mention the names of those whose personal services and exertions we should like to recognise specially, but I feel how dangerous it would be for any one in my position who has not been behind the scenes during the last few months to single out those to whom special honour is due. We desire to honour them all, whether they be of the British or of the Dutch race.<lb/>
But I may be permitted to say one word&#x2014;and I shall do it all the more gladly because it relates to an old friend and colleague&#x2014;in recognition of the part played by Lord Selborne in these affairs. He has held what I suppose we may call a watching brief for the Empire. No one could have shown more tact and courage than he has throughout these negotiations. And may I add to the name of Lord Selborne another name? I think at this moment we must all feel how much is due to the services rendered to the Empire by Lord Milner, who bore a weight of overwhelming responsibility in days when the task was much more thankless and the prospect much less hopeful than it is at present. Without the preliminary work which Lord Milner accomplished I do not think it is too much to say that this great result might have been unattainable. The names of all these men will indeed go down to posterity associated with these events&#x2014;the names of actors in one of the most memorable chapters in the history of the Empire, a chapter begun amidst suspicion, strife, and racial animosities and ending amidst high hopes, generous aspirations, and mutual good will.<lb/>
There were some who in the darkest days of our South African troubles cherished the hope that there would emerge from that great struggle a new order of things in which those admirable elements to be found in South Africa should no longer antagonise, but should be found blended
<col>796</col>
together in happy combination for the good of South Africa, for the good of this country, and for the good of the whole civilised world. That hope has been fulfilled more rapidly than any of us could have dared to hope, and therefore it is in no grudging spirit that we on this side of the House are ready to take our full share of responsibility for assuring to this Bill a safe conduct through this House. And should it ever be our lot, or the lot of those associated with us, to watch over the Bill in operation, you may depend upon it that we shall do so in a spirit not less cordial and friendly than that exhibited by the noble Earl and his colleagues. This is a great Imperial settlement, and it is for the Imperialists of the old country and of the new to see to it that it is made a success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01690"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have very little to add to what has been said. This debate has been quiet because it is unanimous, not because any one has been indifferent to the occasion. The only topic on which I would say a word or two is that relating to the political <i>status</i> of the natives, to which allusion has been so freely made. It is easy to express aspirations for political ideals, but it was quite impracticable for His Majesty's Government to press further the point on which so much insistence has been laid. I think your Lordships should remember, in the first place, that it was a very difficult task to reconcile differences in South Africa itself; next, that these are four self-governing Colonies, and that the doctrine of non-interference with the wishes of self-governing Colonies in regard to their own confines is thoroughly well established between both Parties; and, further, that these provisions are provisions which affect their own life and their own business 6,000 miles away from us.<lb/>
At the same time, I hope that our countrymen in South Africa will feel that the real anxiety that exists in Great Britain on this subject is due not to any selfish reasons of our own, but to our obligations of honour, and that it is shared by large numbers of men in this country who have most honourable sympathy with the native races. This anxiety is not due to any distrust of our countrymen in South Africa, but wherever there is exclusion there always will be apprehension, whether the scene
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0402"/>
<col>797</col>
be in England or in any other part of the world. My hope and belief is that by indirect leading to direct means there will be in good time an admission of the native element in South Africa.<lb/>
My own feeling of satisfaction is the same as that which pervades the whole House. I will not refer to any names of those who may have been parties to this settlement. I am not sure that we should agree or that we do agree altogether with regard to names. But I am certain we all agree in this&#x2014;that there should be an effacement of anything remaining that may be bitter in the minds of any man as to past events in South Africa. Let us imitate the example of those brave and honourable men out there who have forgotten, though they have suffered much more than any of us can possibly have suffered, and look forward to a future of union and unreserved good will among all classes of the people in that distant country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TERRITORIAL FORCE RESERVE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01702"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War if, among the Territorial Infantry included in the swiftly moving central force described by the Secretary of State for War on the 30th November last, men will be excluded who are (1) under twenty years of age; (2) have never fired a recruit's course of musketry; (3) have tired a recruit's course of musketry, but have never fired the annual musketry course of the trained Territorial soldier; and what is the present estimated average strength for active service of Territorial Infantry battalions included in the central force, after making the deductions necessary on account of immaturity, physical unfitness, and lack of musketry training.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01703">The noble Duke said: My Lords, I beg to ask the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War the Questions standing in my name on the Paper. We know now for certain that Territorial battalions are to be used in combination with Regulars in the swiftly moving central force designed by the Government to crush any sudden invasion. Hence they cease to be Second Line troops and we must consider their immediate fighting value. We have never been told whether it is the intention of the Government to include boys of under twenty years of age in their central force. Boys in their teens are no more fitted for active service at home than abroad, because they are physically incapable of carrying the necessary weight of ball ammunition, <i>plus</i> a great coat and rations. Without a pack of that kind the utility and mobility of an Infantry soldier vanish. But this pack, with the rest of the clothing and equipment, according to the Field Service Pocket Book issued by the General Staff, means a weight of sixty lbs. on the man. Tens of thousands of the boys of the type we see in the Territorial Army do not themselves weigh 120 lbs. Are they to march and fight carrying a burden equal to more than half their own weight? We are all agreed that boys are quite unfit to do the work of men in time of peace; therefore, why should they be considered fit to do so in time of war?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01704">My next Question concerns recruits not trained in musketry. It is inevitable that in every Army there must be untrained recruits, useless for the field. At present in the Territorial Force there are 67,087 noncommissioned officers and men who have never fired a recruit's course of musketry.
<col>800</col>
As the strength of the Territorial Force is 260,676 that is rather more than a quarter not available on account of being totally untrained in musketry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01705">My third Question refers to those men who have fired a recruit's course of musketry, which is completed by firing twenty rounds of ball ammunition on the rifle range in one afternoon, but who have not yet fired the annual musketry course, which is to convert them into trained Territorial soldiers returned as efficient in musketry. I ask if these men on the strength of their having discharged twenty rounds of ball ammunition on a single occasion are to be included in the firing line of the central force without further training. Anyhow, we have 67,087 totally untrained recruits and 53,367 men who have once fired twenty rounds of ball ammunition, giving a total of 120,454 untrained and partially trained men in the Territorial Force, and leaving 140,222 trained but up to the musketry standard of the Territorial Force. Now the annual musketry course of the trained Territorial soldier, as far as practice on the rifle range is concerned, consists of one afternoon when he fires twenty-three rounds of ball ammunition. There are certain other shooting gallery practices, but none other obligatory on the range. I believe in the utility of the shooting gallery, but I refuse to believe that firing toy ammunition is any reliable substitute for practice with ball ammunition. As regards the standard of efficiency in musketry of the Territorial Army, it is measured not by the ability of the men to hit the object aimed at but by the number of rounds of ball and toy ammunition discharged. A man may fire his twenty-three rounds of ball ammunition and never hit his target. Then if he fires 445 rounds of Morris tube ammunition in the shooting gallery with the same result, that man will be returned as an efficient soldier as regards musketry. This appears from the last paragraph on page 4 of the War Office Memorandum of November 13, 1908.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01706">What has happened is this. The Government having designed the Territorial Army as a force of the Second Line, now propose to use portions of it as a First Line Army, but do not consider that this change of duties necessitates any corresponding change in musketry training. Can there be any doubt as to the result of the conflict of two firing lines, the one composed largely of boys who do not profess to have either drill or
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0404"/>
<col>801</col>
discipline and whose knowledge of musketry has been acquired by firing once a year twenty-three rounds of ball ammunition <i>plus</i> toy ammunition fired in the shooting gallery, and the other line composed of physically fully matured men, disciplined to the highest pitch and trained to a first class standard of musketry by continually firing an ample supply of ball ammunition in the field?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01707">My last Question is as to the strength of the Infantry battalions in the central force. I do not see how you can reckon&#x2014;but I am now asking for information&#x2014;on more than an average of 350 men per battalion. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War will remember that he once told us that every Infantry Brigade was to consist of four battalions, and that a weak battalion meant a weak Brigade, and a weak Brigade weakened its Division. The Brigade ought to be 4,000 strong. Well, if so, you must put ten or twelve Infantry battalions into every Brigade, and how can such an amalgamation be made at a moment's notice? However, the strength of a Territorial battalion in the central force must depend on whether it is the intention to exclude or include boys of under twenty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01708"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the noble Duke I have first to say that we do not intend to exclude men under twenty from the Territorial Force. We have laid it down that men under twenty should not be employed on foreign service or sent out to India because of the question of health, men under that age being more liable to certain diseases than those above it. But in our view there is no doubt that in a climate like this if the Territorial Army had to go into action men under twenty would be just as good soldiers as those over that age. We see no reason at all for excluding them from the force or from the campaign that the force would be called on to undertake. We do not propose on mobilisation to include recruits or men who have not fired their recruit's course of musketry until they have completed it. The course has been worked out very carefully, and if a man goes through it, including the rounds on the open range and with the Morris tube or at the miniature range, it should make him under ordinary conditions a fairly good shot, and we consider that he would be fitted to take his place in the ranks of the force.<lb/>
<col>802</col>
I am afraid that I cannot give the noble Duke a precise answer to his last Question. It is always rather difficult to estimate the actual number of men who are available in any unit on mobilisation, and at the present time the <i>data</i> we have with regard to the Regular Army do not altogether apply. In the Regular Army we exclude men under twenty, and take as a general average ten per cent. over and above that for men who would be rejected as unfit for foreign service. But in this country there would be no necessity to put so severe a test on the men, so that presumably the number of rejections would be rather under ten per cent. But that is only approximate, and it is no use for me to try to give the noble Duke any actual figure as to the strength at which these battalions would take the field. In these circumstances, if the Territorial Army had to mobilise it would mobilise considerably under strength. We are perfectly aware of that, and are devising means to meet it in order to bring the units up to full strength.<lb/>
Section 7 of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act gives us the power of forming a Reserve to the Territorial Force, and we have now completed the scheme and are about to issue instructions for the formation of a Territorial Force Reserve. We propose to form a Reserve in three separate categories to be called the Territorial Force Reserve, the Technical Reserve, and the Veteran Reserve. The Territorial Force Reserve will have an establishment of 100,000 men. It will consist of captains and subalterns of four years completed service in the military forces of the Crown since 1900. The men who will be eligible to join it will be serving soldiers who have completed four fifteen days camps or their equivalent. That means that if a man has done less than fifteen days in camp it will only count as half a camp, and he would have to put in another half camp afterwards. Those men will be provided with uniforms, and will be allowed to attend camp if they wish&#x2014;there will be no compulsion&#x2014;with their unit up to the establishment of the unit as it goes to camp. If you have a battalion of 900 serving men going to camp, it will be permissible to allow the difference between the 900 and the full establishment to be taken from the Reserve. They will be allowed to draw twenty rounds of ammunition every year to keep up their musketry. These men will make an agreement under which they will be called upon under the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0405"/>
<col>803</col>
same conditions as the Territorial Force on mobilisation. From these men we propose to complete the ranks of the Territorial Force on mobilisation.<lb/>
In the Technical Reserve it is proposed to enrol those men who, having some specialised knowledge of a technical nature, might be able to render very valuable service. That would include people belonging to the medical or veterinary services, railway and telegraph <i>personnel</i>, balloonists and aeroplanists, all of whom might certainly prove useful. Finally, as regards the Veteran Reserve, we are establishing that in order to enable the War Office to get into touch with that very large number of men who have passed through any of the Military, forces of the Crown and have a knowledge of soldiering, and who would be prepared to register their names to be called up for service in case of emergency. The Veteran Reserve will be open to ex-Regulars, ex-Militiamen, and ex-Special Reservists, as well as other men who have served in Irregular corps in the South African war. It is not proposed to organise that force or spend money upon it in the way of equipment or training; what we want to get is a register of the names of those people in order that, if it should become necessary, we might call upon them.<lb/>
This is an important step in advance. We have always realised the soundness of the criticism of the noble Duke, that you cannot have a force whose peace establishment and war establishment are the same unless you have same reservoir to draw upon. That is why we have formed this Reserve, and it is hoped by this means to enable units not only to take the field on mobilisation at full strength, but also to go under training at full strength or something very near it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01709"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am very much obliged to the noble Lord for his answer, especially for the statement concerning the proposed Reserve which was quite unexpected as I had not asked for it. But I should like to know whether or not it is intended to put into the firing line of the swiftly moving central force which is to be called upon at a moment's notice to resist invasion boys of less than twenty years of age who have only fired twenty rounds of ball ammunition in their lives?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01710"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I answered that in the affirmative. Men who have fired their
<col>804</col>
recruit's course will be called up on mobilisation to take their place in the ranks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01711"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: And the veterans, too?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01712"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01713"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the House must have listened with great interest to the concluding part of the answer given by the noble Lord opposite. It is, as far as I am aware, the first we have heard of what seems to me a most important new departure&#x2014;namely, the creation of a new Reserve outside the members of the Territorial Force as we know it at this moment. I will not comment upon that, because we have not yet had time to consider the statement of the noble Lord. But I should like, if I may, to ask him one question which I think arises out of his reply to my noble friend. We now understand that the Territorial Force is to be used not merely for Second Line purposes, but on occasion as part of the central force which on emergency is to be used for the purpose of meeting sudden invasion. I should like to ask whether those members of the Territorial Force who will be told off to serve upon this central force, will be given any special instruction in musketry or whether they will be simply on the same footing as the other members of the Territorial Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01714"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Marquess will give me notice of his question.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TUBERCULOSIS ORDER.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01715"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> rose to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture how much of the sum of &#x00A3;140,000 provided under Section 18 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, had been expended during each of the last three years in compensation for the slaughter of animals suffering from diseases other than swine fever.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01716">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Question which I wish to ask the noble Earl has reference to the sum of &#x00A3;140,000 which may be granted annually by the Treasury towards the fund out of which compensation is paid for cattle slaughtered in consequence of pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, and swine fever. The compensation in respect of swine fever is limited to &#x00A3;50,000, and it is with reference to the distribution of the balance of &#x00A3;90,000 that I am anxious to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0406"/>
<col>805</col>
obtain information. I believe that the amount of pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease recently in this country has been very small indeed, and in all probability the compensation paid in respect of those diseases is practically insignificant. I should be glad to have information on that point, and also to know whether the noble Earl can inform us if it would be possible to apply any part of the &#x00A3;90,000 in carrying out the Tuberculosis Order which the Board of Agriculture recently issued. Tuberculosis is to the community of vastly greater importance than these other diseases, since pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease are communicable only from animal to animal, whereas tuberculosis is communicable directly from animal to man. In my opinion the putting of the compensation payable under the Tuberculosis Order upon the rates will be the greatest possible obstacle to the proper carrying out of that Order, because local authorities will be very unwilling to keenly work the Order if they have to tax themselves for the expense incurred. I hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will be willing to use his influence with the Treasury so that tuberculosis may be included among the diseases scheduled under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01717"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord seemed to imply that this sum of &#x00A3;140,000 provided under the Act was voted every year. That is not the case. Only such sum is voted as is estimated to be required for each year. I am afraid that no part of this money can be used for the purposes of the Tuberculosis Order. That is impossible; but I can assure the noble Lord that I will do all I can to soften the heart of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the matter. I think we may say that we have never had a more sympathetic Chancellor of the Exchequer as regards agriculture than the present one. Brought up in North Wales among the small farmers, he knows the difficulties and troubles of agriculturists, and we are very fortunate to have him as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The amount expended in 1906&#x2013;7 was &#x00A3;100 in respect of pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease, and in 1907&#x2013;8 a similar amount, while in 1908&#x2013;9 we drew &#x00A3;4,000 on account of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Edinburgh. A large number of cattle were slaughtered the moment the outbreak occurred, and I am glad to say that the
<col>806</col>
money we then spent stopped the outbreak and no further damage was done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01718"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: May I ask why the noble Earl says it is impossible to place the charges in respect of the Tuberculosis Order upon this fund? We know, of course, that it is impossible to do so at the present moment, because the fund is limited to the other purposes; but what is to prevent the Government putting in one of their Milk Bills a short clause saying that this fund should be devoted also to this purpose? The one thing that the noble Earl has told us is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is very sympathetic, but the only way in which he can show his sympathy is by putting his hand into the funds of the Treasury and providing the money for this purpose. I take it that the Board of Agriculture, as well, probably, as the Local Government Board, would be very willing to relieve the ratepayers of a charge which ought obviously to be a national charge if they were able to do so. The only Minister who can do this is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I therefore hope the right hon. gentleman is going to show his sympathy by doing what I am sure the Board of Agriculture and the noble Earl would be extremely glad to see him do&#x2014;namely, find some part of the funds himself out of the Imperial Exchequer. I trust that the noble Earl will not think he has at all satisfied those who have taken great interest in this question, and that he will in the later stages of the Milk Bill give us some fuller assurance on this point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01719"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: The Diseases of Animals Act applies also to Ireland, and I would like to suggest to the noble Earl that a short Bill should be introduced adding the Tuberculosis Order to the Schedule of that Act. If this were done it would, I am sure, receive the support of all the Irish Members in the other House. This question of tuberculosis is a very serious one indeed in Ireland, and the disease has come to be known as the white plague. A very important organisation in the country is working against the spread of this terrible disease, and if the noble Earl could see his way to carry out my suggestion he would, I am confident, receive universal support. I hope that he will give some consideration to the point.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MILK AND DAIRIES (SCOTLAND) BILL.<lb/> [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01728">Amendments reported (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01729"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved to amend the definition in Clause 2, which provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"the word 'dairy' shall include any creamery, farm, farmhouse, cowshed, byre, milk store, milk
<col>808</col>
shop, or other premises from which milk is sold or supplied for sale or in which it is stored or kept for purposes of sale, or which are used for the making of butter or cheese for purposes of sale; the word 'dairyman' shall include any occupier of a dairy and any person carrying on the trade of cowkeeper or purveyor of milk; and the word 'milk' shall include cream, skimmed milk, separated milk, and butter milk,"</quote>
by substituting the word "mean" for the word "include" in the three places where it occurred. The word "include," as he understood it, implied that there were some other meanings to be attached to the words "dairy," "dairyman," and "milk," besides those actually laid down in the clause. The definition of "dairy" was already a wide one, and he did not think it was intended that it should have other meanings than those in the clause. The earlier part of the section provided that expressions used in the Bill should have the meanings assigned to them in the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, and those meanings were reproduced, with certain modifications. He gathered that there was no further meaning which could be included in the word "dairy"; and they would object to the word having any wider meaning than that assigned to it in the clause. The noble Lord concluded by moving the first of his three Amendments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01730">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line 11, to leave out the word 'include' and to insert the word 'mean.' "&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clinton</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01731"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member> said he did not pretend to be an authority on drafting, but he was advised that the word "include" was the word used in earlier legislation, that it would only lead to confusion to use a different word now, and that there was no danger, as the noble Lord anticipated, that the use of the word "include" rather than "mean" would lead to any wider interpretation. He therefore submitted that it would be safer to adhere to the word "include."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01732"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> said that if the Secretary for Scotland was satisfied that there was really no danger of a larger meaning being attached to the word "dairy," he would withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01737"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> thought the words proposed to be inserted were superfluous because they were already contained in the definition of "dairy."

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01738"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said he was assured that the words "carrying on the trade" and "purveyor" implicitly conveyed the notion of sale. He would, however, consider the point, and if the words suggested were necessary they should be inserted.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01744"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> moved to add to Clause 5 a new subsection, the
<col>810</col>
object of which was, he explained, to make quite sure that the certificate of registration was a continuing thing. The Bill, even as amended, did not make that quite clear. He was not certain whether Lord Pentland's Amendments would have this effect without this subsection, but he did not think it would do any harm to make the point clear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01745">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 3, line 24, after the word refusing,' to insert the following new subsection:</quote>
<quote>'(4) A certificate of registration shall remain in force until it is revoked by the local authority or until the person to whom it was granted quits the premises in respect of which it was granted, in which case it shall cease to be in force unless and until it is renewed upon the application of the person proposing to carry on the trade of dairyman in the premises in respect of which the certificate of registration was originally granted.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01746"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> submitted that the proposed new subsection was unnecessary. In the Amendments standing on the Paper in his name the Government had accepted the position imposed upon them by the change made in the Bill in Committee abandoning the system of annual licence. He could not answer for what night be the future course in regard to this Bill, but they had loyally carried throughout the Bill the change effected by the decision of their Lordships. If the machinery was not complete they would be very glad to adjust it, but the proposed new subsection would be surplusage in the Bill as it stood.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01747">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01748"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> moved to strike out from subsection (4) of Clause 5 the words&#x2014;
<quote>"Every application for the renewal of a certificate of registration shall be lodged with the local authority not later than the first day of March.

He explained that the object of leaving out these words was to do away with the difficulty arising out of entry at different times of the year. If the Amendment were adopted it would be possible for registration to be secured at any time of the year.</p>

The result of the Amendment would be that a person whose dairy was in one district and who sold milk in another would require, to obtain two certificates.

<title>PUBLIC HOUSES IMPROVEMENT BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01797">Amendments reported (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01798"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to insert, in Clause 1 (Provision for facilities and improvements), the following proviso&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that nothing herein contained shall alter or affect the existing prohibition of gaming upon the premises or any provision of the Gaming Act of 1845, or the existing law, as to the regulation of places ordinarily used for public dancing, music, or other public entertainment under any Act of Parliament."</quote>
He explained that this Amendment had been postponed from the Committee stage at the request of several of their Lordships. Dealing first with the question of gaming, the noble Earl said that although he was sure the noble Lord in charge of the Bill did not desire to relax the provisions of the existing Act, his supporters largely wished to do so. When the Bill was in Committee he (Lord Carlisle) referred to a pamphlet on this question by Mr. Platt, but Lord Lamington stated that he had not read the pamphlet and rather suggested that it was a bogus pamphlet. But this pamphlet, the writer of which was a voluminous author on this question, contained the same arguments
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0412"/>
<col>817</col>
and exactly the same figures, some of them very questionable, as had been given by Lord Lamington, and the pamphlet also contained long quotations from Lord Lamington's speeches. In these circumstances he thought it was not unreasonable to suppose that the pamphlet represented the views of a large number of persons who supported this Bill. The writer of the pamphlet said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am disposed to think that the gaming provisions of the Act of 1872 should be modified to bring them more in accord with present day conditions. So long as they remain as they now stand the ideal public house as a place of entertainment on reformed lines can hardly be realised";</quote>
and he added&#x2014;
<quote>"There are scores of laws on the Statute Book which are never enforced at all."</quote>
This gentleman suggested that the gaming provisions were of the class of laws which it was desirable not to enforce. And he was not alone in that. Mr. Alderman Johnson, chairman of the Licensed Victuallers' Protection Society, in a recent issue of a trade paper, stated&#x2014;
<quote>"However desirable reform of the public-house may be, I do not think it can be effected without the repeal of the gaming laws."</quote>
As they had this strong expression of opinion from the supporters of the Bill though not from the noble Lord in charge of it, it seemed to him very desirable, unless their Lordships wished these laws to be largely disregarded, that his Amendment should be inserted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01799">With respect to that part of the Amendment dealing with music, he would like to insert the words "other than automatic music "after "music." What he wanted to do was not to establish any fresh restriction, but to make it understood that this reform did not mean that the existing regulations, which had been established by successive Acts of Parliament brought in by the late Government and their predecessors, should be allowed explicitly, or by inference, to be interfered with.</p>

<col>818</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01801"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> said he understood from what the noble Earl had said that the existing statutes were very often disregarded and not acted upon, but the people who offended in that way were liable to a police prosecution. But he did not see that that was any reason for inserting the Amendment in his Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01802"><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE</member> explained that he meant that they might be disregarded in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01803"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> failed to see how his Bill would entitle magistrates to disregard the existing law. At all events, he was in possession of legal opinion to the effect that the Bill in no way conflicted with the exercise of the statutes referred to by the noble Earl. The fact was that his Bill had been pretty well knocked out of shape by the acceptance of an Amendment which had been moved by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Haversham, by which the magistrates were given unfettered discretionary powers. The Bill was merely a directing post as to what they considered desirable attainments in the conduct of public-houses, and he believed that if the Amendment was accepted it would tend to confusion and to still further weaken the Bill. It was, moreover, superfluous, and he therefore deprecated its acceptance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01804"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREHURN)</member> said that if the Bill would be weakened by the insertion of an Amendment that the existing prohibition of gaming and the provision of the existing law as to dancing, music, and other public entertainments should not be altered or affected, that was rather an argument against the Bill itself. He could not see why existing laws should not be safeguarded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01805"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said they did not desire to pass bad legislation or confusing legislation. They did not want to send down to the House of Commons legislation which was so bad that it would be difficult to interpret it. Therefore he would like to ask the Lord Chancellor whether the proposed words were necessary and whether, in the absence of Lord Carlisle's proviso, the Bill would not mean exactly the same thing. The Bill did not propose to repeal in any sense the Gaming Act or any provision of the existing law as to the regulation of places used for public dancing, music, or other
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0413"/>
<col>819</col>
public entertainment. He thought it was contrary to practice to insert words preserving any particular Act unless it would be otherwise infringed by the Bill. Their Lordships would be glad to be guided in this matter by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01820">Amendments reported (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01821"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> moved to add a new subsection to Clause 1 (which prohibited the use of hop substitutes in brewing) providing that nothing in the Bill should prevent the use of any preservatives which in the opinion of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise were necessary and for which hops could not be substituted without detriment to the beer. He said the object of the Amendment was to bring the Bill into exact harmony with the statement of the President of the Board of Agriculture on the Second Reading. Lord Carrington then said that the Government had not agreed to prohibit the use of preservatives altogether, but only when the necessary preservation could be obtained by the use of hops. The clause was rather obscure upon the point, and the Amendment was designed with the object of making the intention of the Bill quite clear. There were unquestionably other articles used for preservative purposes in the brewing of beer which could not be replaced by hops. Those compounds were compounds of sulphur dioxide; but hereafter other articles of the same kind might be discovered, and therefore it seemed to him to be desirable that the words should include not only dioxide of sulphur but also any substance which might hereafter be discovered of a similar nature and which
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0414"/>
<col>821</col>
could not be replaced by hops. He wished to make it clear that if hopes could be used in the place of these substances then the use of these substances would be illegal; but if there were substances which hopes could not supply the place of, then his Amendment would cover them.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01824"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member> opposed the Amendment on the ground that it was a wrecking Amendment. The clauses at present laid down clearly all the substances that one could brew beer from. The Amendment, if carried, would do away with the other two clauses, and would practically admit anything that might be allowed by the Customs and Excise, who were the arbitrators in the case. He also opposed the Amendment because it introduced another example of government by Department. Finally, he regarded the words of the Amendment as insulting. He hoped that those, like himself, who were interested in pure beer and hop growing would take exception to the Amendment because hops were actually talked about as substitutes. It was suggested by this Amendment, too, that the Commissioners of Excise and Customs might consider hops detrimental to beer. He could not conceive any Amendment which would be less worthy of being inserted in a Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01825"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member> urged his noble friend not to press the Amendment.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01830"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member> said that as he understood that brewers asserted that sulphur dioxide did not take the place of hops, he did not wish to oppose the Amendment, and he could assure the noble Earl that hop-growers never had any wish to prohibit the use in beer of anything which did not displace hops. Hop-growers had no desire to put any obstacle in the way of brewers, whom they recognised were their best customers, but who, like themselves, were being severely tried at the present time. All they wished was that the unanimous recommendation of the Select Committee, which included a prominent brewer, should be carried into effect as quickly as possible. On the understanding that the noble Earl and others who represented the brewers in the House would agree to eliminate the words "various compounds of" and would not raise any further objections to this part of the Bill, the hop-growers would be only too willing to compromise on this point in the spirit of live and let live, which had ever been the motto of the English tenant farmer. He had an Amendment upon the subject later on the Paper, and he hoped that that Amendment would be accepted in the same spirit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01831"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member> thought the word "compounds" too general a term. The chief analyst's opinion was that sulphur dioxide and its preparations were not substitutes for hops, and could not be held to displace hops. Therefore he suggested that the words of the Amendment should be altered to "other than sulphur dioxide and its preparations." If that were done he thought the Government could meet the noble Earl's wishes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01832"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> thought there was danger in specifying any particular article lest they thereby excluded others. He was entirely in accord with noble Lords behind him in
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0415"/>
<col>823</col>
desiring to exclude the use of anything which was purely a substitute for hops. There were certain articles used, he believed, to a limited extent, which had a bittering but not a preservative effect. All the class of articles which were purely and strictly substitutes for hops ought, in his opinion, to be prohibited. He understood that under the Bill they would be prohibited, and that seemed to him to be entirely right. But he thought it would be wiser and would make the Bill freer from possible litigation if the articles which it was desired to prohibit were specified. There was no doubt that dioxide of sulphur might be said in one sense to be a substitute for hops in respect of its being a preservative. It was a preservative against a class of germ against which hops in large quantities were also a preservative; but if hops were used in such large quantities in the classes of beer for which sulphur dioxide was used the beer would be destroyed to the taste of the people who drank it. He deprecated the specification of any particular article, as Lord Mayo had suggested. He did not understand the difference between compounds of sulphur dioxide and preparations of sulphur dioxide. To the lay mind they seemed very much the same; but it was clear that the more they limited in strict terms the exception in the way proposed the more risk they ran of perfectly harmless substances which were necessary for the brewing trade being prohibited.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01833"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: I think it is clear, from what the noble Lord who has just sat down has said, that there are two ways in which this matter might be approached. You might either take a schedule excluding certain named substances, or you might take a schedule including one or more named substances and permitting their use. The noble Lord suggested that it would have been better to have had an exclusive schedule, but in that case I do not quite understand why he did not put down such a schedule in the form of an Amendment. When the noble Lord says that an inclusive schedule which contains only this one article, sulphur dioxide, is of rather a dangerous character, that can only be because in his opinion, or in the opinion of his friends, there are some other articles which they want to use and think they may be prevented from using. If not,
<col>824</col>
I do not see the objection to naming what, I think, is the one article which they wish to use and which, by common consent, they ought to be allowed to use. With regard to the term "preparations," that is the term used in the Poisons Acts, and there is, I fancy, a distinct chemical difference between a compound and a preparation. A compound may include other articles, but a preparation means one article prepared in a particular way. I hope, therefore, that the House will agree to the Amendment as amended by my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

It might happen that the noble Viscount might be appointed President of the Board of Agriculture, and if that happened he was not at all certain that the noble Viscount would be himself prepared to say that he would approach the consideration of this question in an absolutely judicial spirit.

This would remove a difficulty in the way of small growers. If it was desired to extend small holdings, it was worth bearing in mind that the growing of small patches of hops seemed to offer one of the best hopes for small holders in Kent.

We understood that the policy of His Majesty's Government was to place the foreign producer of hops on exactly the same footing as the British producer, and therefore as the English hop-grower has to mark his bags with his name we contended that the foreign hop-grower should also be required to similarly mark his bags; and that was the promise given by Mr. Lloyd-George in distinct terms to the hop deputation.</membercontribution></p>

I quoted the passage on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Bill; but I do not in the least wish to pin His Majesty's Government to an <i>obiter dictum</i> of Mr. Lloyd-George's. The noble Earl explained that there was a practical difficulty in giving effect to that pledge, because the foreign hop-grower produced his hops in such small quantities that it was impossible to get them marked in the same way as English hops are marked; and I suggested, in the course of debate, as a possible way out of the difficulty, that if we could not obtain a system of marking for foreign hops exactly corresponding to the system which prevails here, it might be done by some plan which would obtain at any rate full particulars as to the origin of the foreign hops. I do not know whether that is possible or not, but I think the whole difficulty may probably be met by the suggestion made just now by the noble Earl behind me, and which, I understand, finds favour with Lord Hardinge and the other promoters of this Bill&#x2014;namely, that the whole of these proposals for the identification of packages of hops should be dropped, and that similar treatment should be extended to producers of hops in this country.

<col>827</col>
marking English hops were done away with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01849"><member>THE EARL OF CRANBROOK</member> explained that what he had suggested was that the requirement that the name of the grower should be marked on the hops should be put an end to. He had not suggested doing away with the marking of the county or district.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01850"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HARRIS</member> said that English hops had a higher reputation in the market than foreign hops, because under the English system it was possible to trace the hops to the place they were grown and the individual who grew them. That gave an honourable reputation to English hops which foreign hops could not claim, and he was doubtful whether the suggestion made by Lord Cranbrook would be received with favour in some parts of the county in which Lord Cranbrook lived. He was not surprised that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture had lost conceit in his word "district." He could not imagine any term more vague. He was advised that there were territorial divisions in Germany, Austria, and France corresponding to the English parish, and that there would be really no difficulty in tracing foreign hops to the parish from which they came. Whether there was a difficulty in the case of foreign hops, in consequence of there being a number of small growers in a territorial area corresponding to a parish, in marking the names of the growers on the pocket, he could not say; but the foreigner was living under a system so elastic now that it was possible for, say, Russian hops to be taken to Bavaria, packed in bags there, and imported into this country as Bavarian hops; or English hops could be sent into one of the best areas on the Continent in which hops were grown, put into bags there, and brought back as hops coming from that particular country. There was no marking on the bags; it was known that this could be done, and therefore foreign hops had not the same reputation as English hops. The effect of the proposal of the Board of Agriculture would be to give a spurious reputation to foreign hops.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01851"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The discussion on this point has proved to be an interesting one. The noble Lord, Lord Balfour, first made a strong objection, I think on a larger scale than the circumstances
<col>828</col>
warranted, against a matter of this kind being left to the Board of Agriculture, and he pointed out that it might so happen that some President of that Board would be so biassed by local considerations as to deal with the matter in a way of which the noble Lord himself could not approve. We always assume in this House, I think, that everybody on every occasion is absolutely unbiassed by his own interests, and more particularly, I hope, is that the case with those who hold Ministerial office. But I am quite sure that my noble friend behind me has no desire to undertake a responsibility of this kind if a better means can be found of meeting this question. Those who represent the hop industry are not entirely agreed in this matter. The noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, as I understand, made a suggestion that it might be well in the case of the English grower to drop the regulation that the name of the grower should be placed on the pocket. On the other hand, it was pointed out, I have no doubt with considerable force, that by many growers that necessity is regarded as a most valuable advertisement, and that the dropping of it might not be altogether a popular thing. Then the noble Earl said&#x2014;at least so I understood him&#x2014;that the small holder whom he wished to see become a grower of hops was placed at a disadvantage in this country. But is that so? Is there anything in the present law to prevent people growing hops in small quantities on small holdings, sending them to a central kiln to be dried, the pockets being then marked with the single name of the person who had packed the hops into the pockets? As I understand, there is nothing whatever to prevent that being done in this country; and therefore it is not accurate to say that in this respect the English small holder is in a worse position than the foreign small holder. Lord Harris pointed out that at present there was nothing to prevent hops being carted about all over the world, if that is a lucrative thing to do, and taken, say, from Russia to Bavaria and thence exported to this country. The Bill as it stands, at any rate, will prevent that practice being carried on, because the name of the country and district in which the hops were grown must be placed on the pocket.</membercontribution></p>

that in a moment. The name of the country and district in which the hops were grown must be placed on the pocket, or a fine of &#x00A3;20 may be inflicted. We all know that Russia is not a district of Bavaria, and therefore the particular case which the noble Lord suggested as possible would be prevented by my noble friend's original suggestion in the Bill. If the amended proposal of my noble friend is objected to, he is quite prepared to leave the Bill as it stands. His Department do not think that it is possible to find ally closer term of definition than "district" which would meet the case Lord Harris made. It is very difficult, if not impossible, in their opinion, to put into the Bill such terms as "parish," which do not possess a real analogy in the different countries in which hops are grown. I have no doubt that if any noble Lord can suggest an ingenious form of words which would carry out a somewhat closer definition than appears in the Bill my noble friend will be glad to consider it. But in the circumstances my noble friend, having no desire to have this forced upon him against the wish of the House, will, I have no doubt, withdraw his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01857">The noble Viscount said he moved this Amendment in consequence of his failure to persuade His Majesty's Government to consent to the deletion of the word "owner," the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture having told them that if they persisted in eliminating the word the Bill would be dropped. The retention of that word in the Bill could have but one effect&#x2014;that of enabling the foreigner to pursue an entirely different system of marking from that which was carried out in this country, where for over forty years the name of the actual grower had had to be placed on every pocket of hops. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture had stated the other day that he based his Bill on the Act of 1866, but Clause 4 of that Act clearly required that the name of the planter and grower of the hops should be marked on the pockets; it made no reference to the owner at all. He therefore failed to see what possible good could accrue to anyone except to the foreigner by proceeding further with this clause. The sole object of the demand of English hop-growers was that all foreign hops coming into this country should be marked with the name of the grower, in accordance with the English custom and in compliance with the undoubted promise given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the hop deputation which waited upon him last year. One object of his demand was to put an end to the iniquitous system of gambling ill "futures." It would also have the effect of putting an end to the system of mixing different grades of hops, and thereby render fraud ill connection with foreign hops as difficult as it now was with English. Again, if the name of any "owner" were allowed to be substituted for that of the actual grower it would be practically impossible to place any efficient check upon foreign hops, for no parcel of hops could be properly identified unless the name of the grower was marked on

each package. Since the noble Earl would not consent to the deletion of the word "owner" the hop industry considered that the best course was to abandon the clause altogether and thereby lighten the Bill and assist the Government in passing it through the House of Commons without much opposition in order that it might come into operation on October 1.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01868"><member>THE EARL OF CRANBROOK</member> said it was impossible to do this in the case of foreign hops because there were such numbers of small growers that the names could not be marked. That might mean half a dozen on one pocket. They did not mark them at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01869"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member> said that there was no reason why the name of the growers
<col>832</col>
should be on the bag in England. It was the custom and a great safeguard for the English grower. The Select Committee of the House of Commons recommended that such marking provisions of the Hops Act as were applicable should be applied to imported hops, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer brought in a Bill on those lines last year. Now when he was carrying out the pledge given to the hop-growers he found that strong objection was taken to it. The Committee presided over by Sir William Collins found that the two main grievances were substitutes and marking. On the second point, this was the pledge given to the hop-growers throughout the country&#x2014;Herefordshire and Worcestershire, as well as Kent&#x2014;and he presumed that they knew last year what they were about and that the marking grievance of last year was a grievance this year. He was bound in honour to stick to the clause. If those who championed the hop industry cut a limb off the Bill they would be responsible, but if necessary he would be bound to take the sense of the House on the question, for if the clause was dropped he was afraid that he might be unable to proceed with the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01870"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HARRIS</member> said that it was hardly necessary for the noble Earl to take so serious and despondent a view about the Bill, even if the middle, instead of a limb, was cut out. What the growers were concerned about was that the foreign hop should be traced to the person who grew it and the place where it was grown. That was imposed by law on the English grower, and all that they asked was that the foreign grower should be put in precisely the same position. Surely, that was not a very extravagant demand. The reply to that was that these people grew their hops in such a way that it was difficult for them to comply with this requirement. If hops could not be imported from those particular districts in consequence of there being a number of small growers, then those districts must go without the advantage of importing hops into England. It would not deprive the English market of foreign hops but only of hops from particular districts where there were a number of small growers, and no doubt the foreign grower would make arrangements to secure the advantage hitherto enjoyed of entering the English market. He was astonished to hear the noble Earl say that it was not necessary for the English grower to put his name on the pocket, for the Act of
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0420"/>
<col>833</col>
1866 seemed clear on the point and there was a penalty for any one who put some other name on the pocket. He advised Lord Cranbrook to test the matter next picking by sending up a pocket or two without a name and seeing whether the authorities would prosecute. If this clause was dropped they fell back on the existing system, and if the growers were content why should the noble Earl regard it as a bad compliment to himself? They appreciated to the full the hard work he had given to the Bill. They would rather be without the clause which the noble Earl offered them than have it in the form proposed, with the permission to omit-the name of the grower and the elastic description of the area in which the hops were grown. The reason they objected to the clause was that at present the foreign hop was a disreputable article, and the clause gave it a spurious respectability. At the same time they accepted gratefully the rest of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01871"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member> also supported the omission of the clause, insisting that if they did not put the name of the actual grower on the bag it would be difficult to trace the place of origin. There could be no question as to the promise which Mr. Lloyd-George gave to the hop deputation. Mr. Lloyd-George said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have no fear of the principle which has been impressed upon me by Mr. Bannister&#x2014;that you should compel these gentlemen to mark their hops with the country of origin and the date of origin. There is nothing unfair in that."</quote>
Then Mr. Bannister said, emphatically&#x2014;
<quote>"And the name of the grower, sir; exactly the same as we have to do in all particulars";</quote>
to which Mr. Lloyd-George replied&#x2014;
<quote>"Quite right. Whatever conditions you impose on the British grower should be imposed on the foreigner. That is not a departure from Free Trade."</quote>
At present there was no means of earmarking foreign hops. Nothing was put on the pockets to show the place of origin, and it was well known in the trade that foreign hops were mixed both in regard to the places from which they came and the date of the crops. The name of the owner had little meaning. It was essential that the name of the grower, as in England, should be placed on the pockets to prevent fraud. There was, in regard to hops, a great deal of gambling in futures. Agents came over to this country and offered to
<col>834</col>
sell hops a great many months ahead, knowing that as they were under no obligation to mark the hops they could describe them in any way they liked, and, if necessary, send over mixed hops. The English grower could not deal in futures in that way because every bag had to be marked, and if the crop was a failure he could not deliver. For these reasons he supported the omission of the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01872"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: There is some apparent difference as to the state of the law as it stands. My noble friend is advised that it is not, in the strict sense, necessary for the name of the grower to be placed on English hops. On the other hand, the legal advisers of the noble Lords opposite apparently inform them that it is. If they are right it would undoubtedly constitute a difference between the treatment accorded to English and to foreign hops, but I cannot help thinking that the noble Lords opposite are mixing up the law and the practice. It is, no doubt, the English practice, and for reasons which have been explained in this debate it is one which is found most desirable by English hop-growers; but I still maintain that, if small English growers choose to act as the sin all foreign growers do&#x2014;grow a small quantity of hops, have them collected and dried with others, and placed in bags by one person&#x2014;the name of that person is the name which would appear on the bags. If that is not so, the aspirations of Lord Cranbrook for hops to be grown by small holders cannot be fulfilled, because they would not be able to carry out the provisions of the law. I hesitate, I confess, to believe that is so. Lord Harris seemed to me to use a somewhat incompatible argument. He objected to the marking of foreign hops, as suggested by Clause 2 of this Bill, because it would give what he called a spurious advertisement to those hops. But I should have thought that if the name of the grower could have been put on that advertisement would have been all the greater and all the more effective, and it is impossible to avoid the suspicion, if the noble Lord will forgive my saying so, that, knowing as he does that the name of the grower cannot be put On&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01882"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> Commented on the difference of opinion which prevailed between the President of the Board of Agriculture and his noble friends as to the marking of the packages. The noble Earl held that English hop-growers were not compelled to put their names upon the pockets, but his noble friends behind him argued that they were so compelled. That was a matter on which he would have thought, considering the time that the discussion had lasted, the President of the Board of Agriculture might have made absolutely certain.</p>

If the practice was universal it was almost the same as the law; he did not think it made very much difference, and therefore, if they were placing the foreigner on the same footing, the conditions under which the foreigner imported hops should be assimilated to the practice which universally prevailed in this country. His noble friends had also shown that without the insertion of the word "grower" the clause would be useless, and he submitted that in these circumstances no practical advantage would be gained from the passing of a law in the form intended by the Government.

<title>TRAWLING IN PROHIBITED AREAS<lb/> (PREVENTION) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01889">Amendments reported (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01890"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> moved an Amendment in Clause 1 (Landing and selling of fish illegally caught prohibited) striking out the proviso at the end of the clause. The words of the proviso were&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that nothing in this Act shall operate to impose liability to any other penalties under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, in respect of the importation of prohibited goods."</quote>
He explained that the effect of the proviso, which was inserted against the Government in Standing Committee, was to relieve notified vessels from their liability to any penalty under the Customs Consolidation Act, except, it would appear, forfeiture of the prohibited fish. Even this was not made clear in the proviso, for by the use of the words "any other penalties" an element of uncertainty was introduced. No penalties had been referred to in the previous part of the clause, and it could not, therefore, be said with any degree of certainty what the precise effect of the proviso might be. The ground on which the Government had consistently resisted the insertion of any such provision was that the result would be to place prohibited fish in a different category from any other prohibited goods referred to in the Customs Consolidation Act and in subsequent statutes which had extended its scope. Where a large staff was concerned it was always undesirable to multiply separate provisions in regard to different articles; but the main reason for retaining powers which doubtless it would not be necessary to exercise was that it was the existence of those powers in the background which
<col>838</col>
enforced compliance with the orders of the Customs Department in regard to forfeiture of prohibited articles. What were the provisions which it was suggested should be excluded? Section 172 provided for the forfeiture of vessels or boats used in the importation, landing, removal, carriage, or conveyance of any uncustomed or prohibited goods. Section 186 provided for heavy penalties upon persons importing or assisting in importing prohibited goods, or delivering, removing, or withdrawing such goods from any ship, wharf, etc., or otherwise assisting in the evasion of the laws prohibiting the importation of such goods. Section 202 gave further power of seizure and detention of boats and persons, and Section 203 made persons refusing to stop or allow examinations when required by Customs officers liable in heavy fines. The Customs Department, however, had full power, under Sections 208 and 209, to exercise a full discretion in regard to all these proceedings, and it was understood that vessels had never been forfeited except in the case of dutiable goods, which prohibited fish were not. In practice the powers complained of would not be exercised, but their exclusion would weaken the executive powers of the Customs officers when desiring to board and detain vessels carrying illegal catches. For that reason the Government objected to their exclusion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01891">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, lines 15 to 18, to leave out the words 'Provided that nothing in this Act shall operate to impose liability to any other penalties under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, in respect of the importation of prohibited goods.' "(<i>Lord Pentland</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01892"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said the proviso was inserted in Standing Committee on the motion of the Duke of Northumberland, who was not able to be present that day and had asked him to state the case for the proviso. In moving to strike out the proviso Lord Pentland had described the use of the words "any
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0423"/>
<col>839</col>
other penalties" as introducing an element of uncertainty; but the words which almost immediately preceded the proviso were&#x2014;
<quote>"fish so caught within such areas shall be added to the table of prohibitions and restrictions contained in section forty-two of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01893">Section 42 was quite clear, and provided that if the goods described in the table of prohibitions and restrictions were imported they should be forfeited. Therefore under this section these fish were liable to be forfeited. Then there were certain other penalties which might be imposed under three other sections which Lord Pentland had mentioned. Those penalties were very severe. Under Section 172 the vessel itself might be forfeited; under Section 186 the captain was liable to a fine of &#x00A3;100, and under Section 202 there was another penalty. Their Lordships would, therefore, see that there were certain other additional and heavy penalties which could be enforced under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876. He submitted that if it was not intended that these penalties should be enforced in cases arising under the Bill, that ought to be made clear, so that any person affected by the Bill should know what his liabilities were. If it was a fact that the only penalty to which the trawler in these circumstances was to be liable was the forfeiture of the fish, what objection could there be to saying so? He was certainly not on the side of these trawlers himself, but it seemed to him that the persons affected by the Bill ought to be informed what they were really liable to. That was the sole meaning of the proviso, and he hoped their Lordships would retain it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01894"><member>LORD BALFOUR of BURLEIGH</member> was of opinion that if there was no other sanction behind the authority of the Customs but the confiscation of the fish the commander of a trawler might give a great deal of trouble. If he did give trouble and refused to obey the legitimate orders of the Customs authorities, then he ought to be punished; but he would be punished not for attempting to import prohibited fish, but for disobedience of the lawful orders of the Customs. The retention of the proviso would, he thought, weaken the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01895"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said there was not one word in Section 172 of the Act of 1876 about disobeying the orders
<col>840</col>
of the officers of the Customs. It might be declared that it was not the intention to enforce the powers under Section 172. But how were they to know it?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01896"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I cannot help thinking that somewhat too much has been made of these terrible penalties by the noble Earl and by the noble Duke on whose motion the proviso was introduced. As has been pointed out, they apply uniformly to all prohibited goods and not merely to dutiable goods. If one prison-made brush was brought into the country these penalties would apply. I presume that in such a case they would not be exacted. But, as the noble Lord pointed out, it is necessary for the Customs to have behind them these very formidable, though rarely exercised, powers. The noble Earl said just now, quoting from a clause of the Act, that it contained nothing which compelled the officers of the ship to be obedient to the orders of the Customs. No; but it is conceivable that the knowledge that the Customs have these powers would make them infinitely more disposed to be careful to obey the orders of the Customs, whereas if there was no such penalty in the background they might safely defy them. If the argument of the noble Earl is a good one, what he ought to do is not to insert this proviso, but amend the Customs Consolidation Act. Those Acts are full of anomalies of all kinds. I remember that in a debate on the fiscal question, during the term of office of noble Lords opposite, I pointed out that there were provisions in one of the Customs Consolidation Acts which directly sanctioned the imposition of retaliatory duties. These are not, as a rule, applied; indeed, I think they never have been applied. Therefore it seems to me not a very desirable thing to do to break into the symmetry of the Customs Consolidation Act on this point, instead of, if these unused powers are considered to be a grievance, going through the Act as a whole and putting its provisions into a less anomalous form. But I quite agree, on the merits, with Lord Balfour that even in this particular case it is desirable that the Customs should retain these powers, and I therefore hope your Lordships Will consent to my noble friend's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01897"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> intimated that he had intended to vote for the retention of the proviso, but on considering the whole
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0424"/>
<col>841</col>
matter he was inclined to support Lord Balfour and the Secretary for Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01898">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01899"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> moved an Amendment to Clause 3 providing that where it is possible for the Fishery Board to take proceedings under the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, for penalties against the master or owner of any British vessel for fishing within the prohibited areas, they shall not notify such vessel to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, as provided by the clause. He said that in the case of genuine foreign trawlers the closing of British ports to the sale of their fish would not be a very serious matter; they would be able to sell the fish at home. British trawlers, however, would suffer much more severely. They could not take their fish elsewhere, and for two months they would be debarred from bringing fish to a British port. The existing law under which a heavy fine could be inflicted on British trawlers was, however, sufficient to deal with their case, and there did not seem to be any necessity for treating them with this increased severity. Another reason for the Amendment was that under the present law the master of the trawler would be summoned before a Court, where he could state his case; under this clause no opportunity whatever was given to the master to be heard in his defence. That was a very serious increase in the penalty against British trawlers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01900">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 2, line 19, after 'Kingdom' to insert the words 'Provided that where it is possible for the Fishery Board to take proceedings under the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, for penalties against the master or owner of any British vessel for fishing within the areas aforesaid, they shall not notify such vessel to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, as provided by this clause.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Eversley</i>.)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01901"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> opposed the Amendment. It would be highly dangerous to adopt differential legislation for British and foreign trawlers. They must have equal treatment under our laws. The noble Lord would notice in Clause 4 a provision against the application of both procedures to an offender under this Bill &#x2014;that was to say, there would be no danger of an offender under this Bill being proceeded against under the Bill and also under the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act. He urged that to carry out these
<col>842</col>
provisions there must be a summary procedure. No course other than that suggested in the Bill would be effective in stopping illegal fishing in the Moray Firth. It was impossible to proceed under the Herring Fishery Act because that involved laying information, and by the time that could be done the cargo of fish would have been discharged and probably sold by the offending trawler.</p>

<title>LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES (MEDI-<lb/> CAL TREATMENT) BILL.</title>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01905">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01906"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this late hour I will not detain you for more than two minutes in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, and even on the merits of the case I do not think it necessary for me to do so. The object of the Bill is to wipe out a blot that undoubtedly exists in the law. As your Lordships know, under the Education Act of 1907 power is given to a local authority to medically inspect children when they first enter the school, and to provide such medical treatment as the Board of Education may authorise. Both these are at present charged on the rates. This Bill makes no change as regards inspection, but it makes it possible in future for the local authorities to recover the cost of medical treatment from the parent, if the parent can afford to pay it. I lay stress upon the point that the parent must be in a position to afford to pay, and there is in the Bill ample protection for very poor parents. Local authorities have been diffident as to the exercise of this power to any large extent owing to the great charge it would obviously place upon the rates. That, my Lords, is the reason for presenting this Bill. I may add that there is a precedent for the Bill in the Provision of Meals Act, 1906, which gives power to the local authorities to recover from the parents. The Children Act which your Lordships passed last year makes neglect to provide necessary medical treatment
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0425"/>
<col>843</col>
an offence under the Act, and this I think, points to the fact that the provision of medical treatment by parents is an obligation which the State recognises. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01907">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Donoughmore</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01908"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to offer any opposition to the Second Reading of this Bill. It has passed through the other House, and I am quite prepared to believe that in some cases it will have a good effect in inducing local authorities to institute a system of medical treatment when otherwise they might be somewhat nervous about doing so. I think, however, it must be admitted that, like some other measures of this kind, its success will depend very largely on the care and the spirit in which it is administered. It would be very unfortunate if in any locality too hard a construction were placed upon the provision that the parent must pay if he is able to do so. If too hard a construction were placed on that provision I fear it might have the rather dangerous effect of discouraging parents who are really poor if not absolutely indigent from having recourse to this medical treatment for their children. That is really the only criticism I have to make of the measure, that it is one of those for which very sympathetic and reasonable treatment is required on the part of the local authority. I hope that any fears I may have on that side may not be realised, and if that is so I am quite willing to believe that the Bill may prove to be in some respects a useful measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01909"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was glad to observe the spirit in which the noble Earl the Leader of the House received this Bill. I have no fault to find with anything he said, and I quite agree with him that the greatest care should be taken by the local authorities in carrying out the Bill. I think, however, that the local authorities may be trusted not to abuse the measure if it becomes law. The Act of 1907 imposed on local authorities the duty of seeing that medical inspection was brought to bear on the children in their schools. It was made compulsory, and consequently in cases where the parents are fairly well off the cost of medical inspection should not be
<col>844</col>
thrown on the rates, which are already greatly overburdened.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01910"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess is mistaken, is he not, in thinking that this Bill refers to inspection? I think it refers to medical treatment only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01911"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I meant to say medical treatment. There is a precedent for this in the Provision of Meals Act, and I cannot see any reason why local authorities should be called upon to pay the expenses of the medical treatment of children whose parents are well able to pay. I do not think that any difficulty will arise except in very extreme circumstances. My mind goes back to the Departmental inquiry held at the time I was President of the Board of Education and conducted under the auspices of the late Duke of Devonshire, and I remember that when we went into the question of the feeding of children in the poorer parts of London we found that there were three classes of parents&#x2014;parents who could pay and would not, parents who felt rather insulted at the proposal that their children should be fed for them, and parents who could not feed their children at all. Again, we find that there are a certain class of parents who desire that their children should not go to the ordinary elementary schools and are prepared to pay fees in respect of education practically the same as that given in the public elementary schools. Recognising that parents who can afford to pay for the education of their children do so in many cases, I think that there is no need for apprehension in regard to the working of this Bill, and that this will be found a satisfactory method of in some way relieving the burden placed upon the shoulders of the ratepayers under the Act of 1907.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TRAFFIC IN DECREPIT HORSES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01918"><sup>*</sup><member>The EARL OF MAYO</member> rose to call attention to the exportation of decrepit horses to the Continent, and to move for Papers. The noble Earl said: My Lords, there is no doubt that this traffic exists, and that the reason why the exportation of horses to Holland and Belgium is so large is that it is an imperative necessity for the poorer classes in those countries to have cheap animal food. The Dutch Government prohibit the transit of meat across their frontier, and the Belgian Government, by an Act passed in 1905, allow only live animals to enter their country. This is no new subject. It has claimed the attention of Parliament before. A Bill was introduced in the House of Commons in December, 1908, by Mr. George Greenwood, and supported by eleven other Members of Parliament. In February, 1908, a Bill was presented by Sir Howard Vincent, and another one just before he died in March, 1908.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01919">But before these dates, as long ago as 1898, a deputation was received by Mr. Walter Long, who was then President of the Board of Agriculture. The result of that interview was that the Board of Agriculture issued an Order, dated November 25, 1898, regarding the prohibition of the exportation of unfit horses. That Order pro-
<col>846</col>
vided that it should not be lawful to convey in a vessel from any port in Great Britain any horse which, owing to age, infirmity, illness, injury, fatigue, or any other reason, could not be so conveyed without cruelty during the intended passage and on landing; and penalties were provided if anything were done or omitted in contravention of any of the provisions of the Order. I do not wish to make any comment on that Order. I had thought that that Order would have covered everything, and I was going to urge the noble Earl to put it in force; but I am informed that it only deals with horses on board ship in the direction of seeing that they are properly treated there.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01920">Now let me tell your Lordships what is going on at the present moment. Horses of &#x00A3;5 and under were exported to Belgium in 1904 to the number of 2,475, and in 1907 the number fell to 1,777. The figure in regard to Holland in 1904 was 2,333, but in 1907 that number rose to 15,719. There is a larger number of horses classified by the Board of Agriculture as of &#x00A3;5 in value and under shipped to Holland. This is easily explained because Holland imports these horses only for food; they are under the supervision of the Dutch police, and are slaughtered at the port of entry. The Dutch traffic compares favourably with that to Belgium. The larger proportion of the horses that are sent to Belgium are of the value of &#x00A3;10 and under, as many of them are worked before they are slaughtered. I make no appeal to sentiment, but will let the House draw its own conclusions from the facts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01921">The ports from which these old and decrepit horses, many of which suffer from horrible complaints, are sent abroad are Hull, Goole, Newcastle, Leith, and the London docks. The traffic has nearly ceased in the London docks owing to the action of the metropolitan magistrates, who have not only enforced fines but have put people in prison for dragging these wretched horses through the streets. On one occasion when an inspector of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals came up to some ruffians who were dragging a horse through the streets they fled, leaving the horse, which had to be taken away and slaughtered. I ought to mention that the Wilson Line, one of the largest shipowners in the world, carry the greatest number of these horses. A gentleman who returned from Antwerp yesterday, having been sent
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0427"/>
<col>847</col>
there by responsible persons, and who is prepared to corroborate the facts in a Court of Law, states in his report that four boats from Hull, Goole, Newcastle and Leith respectively disembark horses every Monday at Antwerp. Some are in such a bad condition that they have to be taken in wagons to the market, three miles distant from the quay; some are slaughtered on the quay; and some die on the voyage, mainly during the winter months. Before I proceed let me say that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture has all these facts before him. I am not springing anything upon him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01922">The following is a record taken from the report of the Antwerp Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 'to Animals, which has been signed by M. Henri Duflon, the Society's inspector who watches these boats&#x2014;
<quote>"From January 4, 1909, to July 19, 1909. Horses conveyed from the quay in wagons: Hull boat, 86; Goole boat, 34; Newcastle boat, 21; Leith boat, 21&#x2014;total 162. Horses arrived dead: Hull boat, 9; Leith boat, 2; Goole boat, 2; Newcastle boat, 1&#x2014;total 14. Horses killed on quay: Hull boat, 2; Leith boat,2&#x2014; total, 4."</quote>
I think that those are terrible statistics. M. Duflon states that&#x2014;
<quote>"On every Monday this year the Hull boat has disembarked horses in such a state as to need transport to the market";</quote>
and that the total number of horses shipped to Antwerp from January 4 to July 19 of the present year was&#x2014;From Hull, 3,305; from Goole, 2,086; from Newcastle, 1,237; from Leith, 408&#x2014;total, 7,036. That is a not unimportant trade which brings large profits to the people who deal in it. These men go round the country and when they find wasted and broken-down horses, suffering, it may be, from horrible complaints, they purchase them for very small sums indeed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01923">M. Joseph Moulekers, the secretary of the Antwerp Society, states that twenty per cent. of the horses arriving in Antwerp are in a lamentable state and unable to stand transport. I must now dot my i's and cross my t's in this matter, and I will therefore read to your Lordships exactly what this gentleman, who returned from Antwerp yesterday, saw. He states&#x2014;
<quote>"The following cases I saw myself on Antwerp quay this week: Roan gelding with much swollen sore foot hound up with sacking, and stinking
<col>848</col>
horribly. Dark brown mare in similar condition. Grey mare with neglected open tumour on elbow. Horse with open wound on fetlock, discharging freely and much flyblown. Horse with overshot fetlock. Pony in similar condition, and must have been so for some months. Bay gelding with bind fetlock bowed. Horse very lame through deformity of foot. Horse with foreleg bowed."</quote>
He also saw a black gelding about sixteen years old, blind in both eyes, lame in both hind legs, and in an extreme state of exhaustion. Owing to blindness it had knocked itself about badly on the boat, and its head was covered with bleeding cuts. When led on the quay it walked into an iron pillar and gave itself another wound on the nose. The Antwerp officials were astonished that such an animal should have been embarked. This gentleman spent four and a-half days making inquiries as to the fate of the animals when purchased, and he asserts that beyond doubt many of them ate put to do more work. The dealers travel regularly, some of them weekly, between Belgium and Great Britain, and one man of East Dereham admitted to this gentleman that he had a slaughterer's licence. That is not fair, because, of course, men with these licences can purchase horses presumably for slaughter and can then convey them to the docks and ship them abroad. The three points which my informant lately from Antwerp wishes to emphasise are&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>"(1) That many sellers of old horses in England are deceived by the dealers who ostensibly purchase the animals for slaughter.</li>
<li>(2) That in the case of about 75 or 80 per cent. of the animals shipped to Antwerp there is cruelty in England in subjecting them to the risk of being put to Further work.</li>
<li>(3) That many of the horses I have seen arrive at Antwerp must have been suffering in England for a considerable time."</li></ol>
I do not wish it to be thought for a moment that I desire to interfere with the trade in old horses for food if they are sound and if the Belgian and, Dutch people choose to eat this meat; but it is disgusting to think that these diseased and stinking horses should be made into sausages.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01924">I feel a certain amount of shame at having to mention it in public that Great Britain should permit such a horrible trade as that to which I have called attention to go on, but I have thought it my duty to bring it before this House, and I hope we shall have a satisfactory statement on the subject from the noble Earl. We in Ireland are lovers of horses. The
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0428"/>
<col>849</col>
breeding and training of horses is one of our chief industries. Two years ago I was asked to call attention to this matter in Parliament because of the gathering together of a lot of "old crocks" for this purpose on a certain field near Dublin. The attention of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was directed to the matter, but the horses disappeared and the people could not be got at. This is a traffic which is carried on in the early morning and late at night, and your Lordships can imagine the sort of low-class horse "copers" who do this work. I will not detain your Lordships longer, but will conclude by thanking the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture for affording me the opportunity of directing his attention to this matter, and by moving for the Return asked for in my Motion.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01926"><member>LORD ABERDARE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has gone so fully into this matter that it will be necessary for me to say very little. But as a member of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals I desire to say that we welcome the Motion which the noble Earl has moved, and that I endorse all he has said. The noble Earl gave the credit for the great reduction in this traffic at the London docks to the metropolitan magistrates, but I should like to say that great credit is due also to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as nearly all these cases are brought forward by their inspectors. The inspectors are greatly hampered in their work because, as the noble Earl has said, these horses are often moved at midnight and in the early morning to avoid public scandal and also to avoid the inspectors. Moreover, the inspectors cannot follow the horses beyond the dock gates, as they are then on private ground. But, in spite of the
<col>850</col>
difficulties under which their inspectors work, the Society have since 1902 obtained no fewer than 635 convictions in this trade alone. I do not wish to say more, but I would urge the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture to provide several qualified veterinary inspectors to put an end to this disgraceful traffic.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01927"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must confess that since I have been at the Board of Agriculture I have been rather uneasy about this trade, owing to the unsatisfactory reports about it which have reached the Office. I honestly think we owe a debt of gratitude to the noble Earl for having brought this matter forward. The Motion of the noble Earl and the action which has been taken by the newspaper Press, by those public-spirited men and women who have spared no pains to elicit the truth in the matter, and last, but not least, by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, have enormously strengthened the hands of the Board in dealing with it, and I can assure the House that we shall make the fullest possible use of the assistance which has thus been afforded us.<lb/>
I may say that this morning, with the sanction of the Treasury and the approbation of the Prime Minister, I have been empowered to obtain the services of a special veterinary inspector, who will be appointed at once, and the whole of whose time will be devoted to the enforcement of the provisions of the Order and the supervision of the work of the local authorities. This inspector will begin his work, I hope, during the present week. We have got our eye upon a man specially qualified, and I think he will make a very valuable official. The requirements of the Order are emphatic enough, but everything depends upon the manner in which those requirements are interpreted and carried out in practice. There have been cases, I must admit, in which much too sanguine a view has been taken of the capacity of a horse to travel during the intended passage and on landing without cruelty, and I am determined that these cases shall not recur. The special inspector will, therefore, be instructed to secure the adoption of a much higher standard of capacity to travel than has hitherto been the case and to bring about a uniform inspection at all the ports.<lb/>
I am confident that I can count on the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0429"/>
<col>851</col>
co-operation of the shipowners, and I am pleased to say that from no source have I received any complaints as to the way these old horses are carried when once they are on board ship. I think I may say that the shipowners have so far satisfactorily carried out the regulations as regards accommodation on board ship. We shall also press upon the local authorities the necessity of employing an increased number of veterinary inspectors for the purpose of enabling them to enforce the Order; and our own inspectors will be instructed to take more frequent voyages in order to see for themselves the condition of the horses on arrival. I hope the House will see that we are in absolute earnest in this matter, and I am hopeful, indeed confident, that the measures we have taken will secure the required result. If not, I shall be prepared to ask Parliament for further powers. In conclusion I may say, not only on behalf of my own Office, but the whole Government, that we are determined that nothing shall be done to impair the reputation which this country happily enjoys throughout the civilised world for its humanity and sense of what is right in all matters in which animals are concerned. I shall be glad to give any Papers that we possess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01928"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer which the noble Earl has just given is, in my opinion, very reassuring. I set great importance upon more veterinary inspectors being appointed, and the further statement of the noble Earl that if the steps he has now foreshadowed do not achieve the desired result he will ask Parliament for further powers is absolutely satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01972"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to Clause 26. The clause ran&#x2014;
<quote>"The qualifications of a senator shall be as follow:&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>He must&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) be not less than thirty years of age;</li>

</ol></quote>
<quote>For the purposes of this section, residence in, and property situated within, a colony before its incorporation in the Union, shall be treated as residence in and property situated within the Union."</quote>
He moved to insert after "British subject," in paragraph (<i>d</i>), the words "and if representing the Province of Transvaal or Orange Free State." He had a similar Amendment to the clause relating to the qualifications of Members of the House of
<col>856</col>
Assembly. The object of the Amendment was to qualify natives for election to the Union Parliament as representatives of the Cape or Natal. In these colonies no bar of race or colour existed to election to the local assemblies, so that his Amendment, if carried, would maintain the existing law with respect to natives in the Cape and Natal. Since he spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill he had received a copy of a petition of a simple but touching character from the assembled chiefs in these colonies pleading with great earnestness for the retention of the privileges they now enjoyed in the Cape and Natal, and which, they said, and said truly, they had never abused. This petition had been addressed to the Governor-General at the Cape to be forwarded to the King. Had he known of its existence before, he would have moved that the petition be printed and circulated among their Lordships. In the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill there was an extraordinary concurrence of opinion as to the impolicy, if not something worse, of making the natives ineligible for election to the Union Parliament. The one exception was Lord Northcote, who referred to the strength of the popular feeling in Australia in favour of maintaining that Commonwealth as a white country. But there was a wide difference between Australia and South Africa. In Australia the demand was not that coloured inhabitants should be disqualified for all time from taking any part in the government of the country, but that the immigration of coloured people should not be permitted. In South Africa there was no such absence of coloured population as there was in Australia. The blacks were there; they could not be excluded or got rid of, and they multiplied more quickly than the whites. In these circumstances was it good policy that they should be excluded from the sphere of government? In Cape Colony there were over 22,000 natives on the register. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, had spoken of the Cape as a halting place to which people did not go to settle. That might be said of many places. But the pathetic fact was that the Cape had become a halting place because it was not a good place for the settlement of whites in consequence of the dissociation of sentiment between the blacks and the whites. Since the blacks were there he maintained that it was a matter of policy and of good
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0432"/>
<col>857</col>
government to provide that they should be duly qualified, without any bar on account of race or colour, to enter the sphere of legislative government. He had been speaking hitherto of the natives of South Africa alone, but there were many other persons of colour there. Among them were University men, medical practitioners, men in considerable positions who had earned the respect of their white fellow subjects; and if the Bill were passed in its present form these men would be disqualified for election to the Union Parliament. It was said that if any change were made in the Bill it might endanger the scheme of the Union. As to that, he had heard that if a sincere and clear issue had been raised at the Conference by the representatives of the Cape and Natal in favour of making the coloured races in these colonies eligible for election the disqualification would not have been inserted in the Bill; but no such proposal had been made. He was surprised at the degree of tolerance and, indeed, of agreement expressed by certain members of the delegation now in London in regard to what he had said in favour of the coloured races in the debate on the Second Reading. He admitted the difficulty of pressing his Amendment to a Division. If it were inserted the delegates here had no authority to accept it, and it would probably have to go back for consideration by a new Convention. Their Lordships might therefore hesitate to take such a step. He himself would hesitate to press the Amendment to a Division; but he submitted it for the purpose of eliciting, if possible, another chorus of agreement as to the painful character of this disqualification, being persuaded that an expression of opinion on this subject on the part of their Lordships would have the greatest influence for good in South Africa&#x2014;influence which might prevent further steps being taken in an injurious direction and which might freely be taken if it were not apprehended that the feeling here was strongly against such a course.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01974"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member>, in supporting the Amendment, said he did not yield to any one in his enthusiasm for the South African Union. That satisfaction
<col>858</col>
was, however, tempered by alloy of the most serious kind if the Amendment was not inserted. Their Lordships ought to object to disqualification which was purely and simply that of race. Lord Courtney's Amendment merely allowed them to retain the <i>status quo.</i> He did not say that the great measure of Union must not take place if accompanied by this disqualification, but he urged their Lordships to emphasise the displeasure with which the insertion of the disqualification was regarded. Their Lordships would be in a far better position if they passed the Amendment even if afterwards it had to be withdrawn at the request of the South African delegates. Then at any rate there would be on record an expression of their Lordships' feeling on the matter in which they would he ventured to say be representative of the higher feeling in this country. If it was merely allowed to rest on sentiments expressed in speeches he was afraid it would rest on something which would be easily forgotten; but if it rested on an Amendment carried in their Lordships' House even though afterwards withdrawn he ventured to say that it would rest on a far more solid basis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01975"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will all agree that my noble friend behind me has brought forward his Amendment, and the parallel Amendment to Clause 44, in the most moderate and least aggressive form which he could devise, and that he has set it before the Committee in a speech of equal moderation. My noble friend said that to pass this Amendment would, after all, only be to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> In a sense that may be accurate, but I think the statement does not represent the real position. The creation of the Union Parliament so completely alters the whole position that the <i>status quo</i> cannot be said in any real sense to exist any longer. The mere fact that natives could be elected to the Cape Parliament does not make it a retention of the <i>status quo</i> to declare that they should be capable of being elected to the Union Parliament.<lb/>
My noble friend said very truly that there was something like a general concurrence of opinion that in itself this provision is an undesirable one. There was, as he truly said, scarcely a dissentient
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0433"/>
<col>859</col>
voice, if any, raised to that proposition; but there was an equally marked and declared concurrence that it would not be wise for your Lordships to attempt to amend that provision. That concurrence was at least as strongly marked as the other. I confess that I am not able to fall in with the proposition suggested by my right reverend friend the Bishop of Birmingham, that it would be a wise or a dignified thing to insert an Amendment of this kind in the Bill on the understanding that it would be immediately withdrawn if the delegates, as they undoubtedly would, objected to <i>its</i> insertion. The process of marching up a hill and then marching down again is not one which I think would commend itself to your Lordships' House, and I confess I do not see that anything whatever would be gained by following the course which the right reverend Prelate has suggested.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me misunderstood, I think, one observation which I made when moving the Second Reading, when I spoke of South Africa having been in past history a halting place on the road of travellers and, of adventurers into other parts of the world. That was so, but it has altogether ceased to be the case. It is in no way true now to speak of South Africa as being a halting place. It is the home&#x2014;the permanent home, as I hope&#x2014;of a great white race, and although my noble friend was right in describing the complications which exist there from the presence of a coloured population, that does not alter the fact that as much as any part of His Majesty's Dominions South Africa is now a permanent white settlement. I do not think that my noble friend is really doing a good turn to the native population, whose interests he has at heart, by moving this Amendment, and I do not believe that we should be doing them a good turn by inserting it in the Bill. It has often been said, and I believe with truth, that if after the great Civil War in the United States the conquering North had not been quite so urgent in declaring the equality of the two races in the Southern States, real equality, which, after all, does not exist there now after the lapse of more than forty years, would have been sooner approached than by the strong and overwhelming assertion of equality which at that time they thought it right to make. Similarly, I believe that if we were to attempt to force upon white opinion in South Africa to-day provisions of this kind
<col>860</col>
which conflict, if you like, with the prejudices, but also with the views which are most strongly held, we should be deferring rather than accelerating progress in the direction of equality between the white and the native races. The opinion even of the native population is not entirely unanimous on this point. This very fear has occurred to some of them. Some of them are actually afraid that any demonstration of this kind might serve to influence white opinion against them rather than in their favour, and so operate prejudicially to them. I share the belief which my noble friend at that time on the Woolsack expressed, that as years go on there may be, as we hope there will be, a change of opinion in South Africa in this respect. We must look forward to that future, but I do believe that that future would be made more remote if the Amendment of my noble friend were adopted, and for that reason, as indeed he has clearly foreseen and most fairly stated, the Government cannot agree to the insertion of this Amendment or the one to Clause 44.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01976"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> said that the precedent of the United States which the noble Earl had quoted was not applicable. He was not inclined to force on the South African colonies something entirely repugnant to their views&#x2014;the establishment of perfect equality between black and white; he was trying simply to maintain that which existed. He put it to his noble friend whether he thought that the eligibility of the native to sit in the Cape Parliament ever since that Parliament was established had retarded the advancement of the natives of the Cape. Compared with the native in the Transvaal the native of the Cape was much more advanced. He was more educated and was admitted to functions of a highly useful and public character. Was he, therefore, in seeking to maintain the privileges now enjoyed by natives in the Cape, doing something which would retard their advancement? He could not but think that the experience of the last fifty years falsified the suggestion which the noble Earl had made. He would not withdraw his Amendment although he did not intend to press it to a Division.</p>

<image src="S5LV0002P0I0434"/>
<col>861</col>
indeed from saying that the fact that the native was eligible, or might be eligible, to Parliament would do anything to retard the progress of the race. On the contrary, I go farther and say that if there was a general native vote all over South Africa, I think it would do something in all probability to raise the status of the native in the other provinces to something approaching that which he holds in the Cape Colony. The conclusion which I asked your Lordships to draw from the American analogy was not that the suggestion was bad in itself, but that because it was forced upon an unwilling population that fact of itself had had the effect of retarding the progress of the negro.</membercontribution></p>

As a matter of fact, I believe no legal decision exists as to what "European descent" really means, and I have no doubt that after the Act has come into operation the phrase will be decided in the ordinary way before a Court of law. If it bears the construction, as to which I express no opinion, which my noble friend on the Cross Benches thinks it does, I can only say that the grievance will be considerably minimised in a great number of individual cases. We have been so far taking it in debate as excluding all persons who could be said to be coloured, but if not, there is no doubt the less objection to passing it in its present form.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-01984"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member> pointed out that this clause provided that the number of
<col>862</col>
members to be elected in the original provinces at the first election should be as follows:&#x2014;Cape of Good Hope, fifty-one; Natal, seventeen; Transvaal, thirty-six; Orange Free State, seventeen. He presumed that the difference in the number of representatives was due to population, wealth, and other reasons. But with regard to the Senate there was absolute equality, Clause 24 providing that eight Senators should be nominated by the Governor-General in Council, and that for each original province eight Senators should be elected. He asked how it was that one principle had been applied to the number of Senators to represent each State and a different principle in regard to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-01985"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I have not discussed this point with the delegates because it was never raised in the course of the communications which I had with them. The noble Lord will notice that in the allocation of numbers for the House of Assembly some advantage is given to the smaller provinces in the numbers there put down. They get a somewhat larger share than their population warrants. I think it is safe to state that the provision of giving an equal number of Senators to each province represents a feeling of the same kind&#x2014;namely, that the case of the smaller States demands some special consideration. As the noble Lord knows very well, in many constitutions of a Federal Government&#x2014;for instance, in the United States&#x2014;the States are all treated alike for the purpose of the Senate, although they are not so treated for the House of Representatives; and it does not seem to me, therefore, especially strange that in a unifying constitution such as this a similar plan should be adopted.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl in charge of the Bill had stated that these points were subject to legal interpretation afterwards, but he did not think their Lordships should be asked to pass dubious phrases to be hereafter interpreted in a way of which some noble Lords might approve and others highly disapprove.</p>

He said that if their Lordships regretted the necessity of having to place on the Statute Book a law of civic disqualification on the ground of race or colour, and also to pass the Bill without any material alteration, he thought that it was the more incumbent upon them to allow no opportunity to slip or anything to escape by which they might reduce as far as might be the prejudicial effect of the Bill. He was aware that the Leader of the House stated in his opening speech that it would be possible always to deny the King's approval to any particular Act promoted by the Union Parliament. He was also aware, according to the terms of the Bill, that if the members from Cape Colony were solid, it would not be possible for a long time, or, at all events, so long as the proportions of the population remained what they were now, to obtain a two-thirds majority for an alteration of the law. But he thought it was very uncertain that the Cape representatives would be able to maintain that solidarity in respect of the native vote, and he said that if the Union Parliament were unanimous in pressing on His Majesty such an alteration in the law as this clause contemplated it would be impossible to deny assent. They were not asking too much, therefore, or imposing on the Union Parliament too great an obligation, when they said that it should not proceed to touch the question of the franchise until such a period had elapsed&#x2014;he suggested ten years in his Amendment&#x2014;within which it might be hoped that the feelings which the present proposals called into existence had subsided, and when the Union Parliament might be disposed to come to the assistance of the Empire and relieve it from a difficulty which was, he believed, being generally recognised throughout the country.</p>

<col>865</col>
together before any change can be made. I certainly do not desire to qualify anything which I said on that occasion in disapproval of the provision as it stands. I frankly confess that the provision for a possible change in this respect is the provision which I like least in the whole of this Bill. But for reasons which I then stated I do not myself think that the danger of a change being made is a great one, and I was glad to see that I was confirmed in that opinion by the speech of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition. The noble Lord who has just sat down spoke of the possibility of a unanimous opinion of the Union Parliament for a change of this kind, and the difficulty there would be in disallowing a Bill so presented here for His Majesty's assent. I admit that. If opinion in South Africa should be so hardened that there was practically only one opinion in the country that no native ought to have a vote in the Cape Colony, it would no doubt be a serious matter to disallow such a Bill, although I will not go so far as to say it might not be done; but that, I confess, is a state of things which I cannot conceive. I greatly doubt, as I said before, whether it would be possible to obtain under any circumstances a two-thirds majority, but that there should be anything like practical unanimity is a consideration which I must decline to admit. The noble Lord, actuated, I am sure, by the very best intentions towards this native franchise, desires to insure it for ten years. Although I hope there may be a general improvement of feeling in this respect, in one way I am less afraid of this ten years than I should be of a sudden wave of feeling arising at some future and remote time. During the next ten years the passing of this Act of Union will be fresh in the minds of all the South African statesmen who have been here, and they will, I am sure, be unwilling to think of disturbing so important a provision as this; and my main objection to the noble Lord's Amendment is that it almost seems to invite reconsideration of the matter at the end of ten years. I should be so afraid of its being possibly taken in that sense that, even if I were asked to put it in by the South African delegates themselves, I confess I should have great hesitation in doing so.

<quote>"The King, with the advice of the Privy Council, may, on addresses from the Houses of Parliament of the Union, transfer to the Union the government of any territories, other than the territories administered by the British South Africa Company, belonging to or under the protection of His Majesty, and inhabited wholly or in part by natives, and upon such transfer the Governor-General in Council may undertake the government of such territory upon the terms and conditions embodied in the Schedule to this Act,"</quote>
by inserting, after the words "The King, with the advice of the Privy Council, may," the words "at the expiration of ten years from the establishment of the Union." He understood that the delegates laid no great stress on this clause or on the schedule, and that they would even be content to see both clause and schedule struck out of the Bill. If he was not misinformed, certain questions did, arise on this subject between His Majesty's Government and the delegates. The Colonial Secretary desired to stiffen some provisions and the delegates replied that rather than consent to that they would like to see the clause dropped altogether. The delegates were not in a hurry to take over the Protectorates and were willing to come to the Parliament of the United Kingdom again for authority to have them transferred, when they wished the transfer to take place. If that was the situation, their Lordships were quite free to deal with the two Amendments that he had placed on the Paper. The first Amendment was that application for the transfer of any Protectorate should not be made until the expiration of ten years from the establishment of the Union, and this Amendment would be apparently quite acceptable on the part of the representatives of South Africa. His second Amendment was to add a proviso to the effect that no such transfer should be made until the terms and conditions of the transfer were made know to the chiefs and inhabitants of such territory and opportunity given them to express their desires with respect to such transfer, or in support of any modification in its terms and conditions. Their Lordships would
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0437"/>
<col>867</col>
observe that the proviso did not make their consent a necessary condition of the transfer; it only required that they should be informed of what was proposed and should be allowed to make ally suggestions they might desire. As to his first Amendment, the one he was now moving, there was a real danger with respect to the transfer of the Protectorates. Two questions would probably occupy the Union Parliament in the future&#x2014;first, the question of the relations between the coloured residents and the white; and, secondly, there would be a demand for the transfer of the Protectorates. Although the delegates were not eager to have these provisions inserted now, there was no doubt that on the part of a considerable number of inhabitants in South Africa there was a strong desire to get one or other or all three of the Protectorates transferred. The inhabitants of one province had already set longing eyes on Bechuanaland. Basutoland had been very much desired by another province, and Swaziland by another province. The thing to be apprehended was that at no distant time application would be made for the transfer to the Government of the Cape of one of these Protectorates. There was considerable objection on the part of the inhabitants of the Protectorates to being transferred. An interesting communication appeared in <i>The Times</i> three weeks ago giving an account of an interview between the Acting Administrator of Bechuanaland and the chiefs of that country. The Acting Administrator told them that there was no intention at present to hand over Bechuanaland to any local government, but the thing might happen at no distant time and he thought it well to submit it to them to be thought over; and they one and all replied that they did not desire the change, but wished to remain as they were. That was the unanimous opinion of the people of Bechuanaland; and representatives had come over from Basutoland to beg that no change should be made in their position. Not one of these steps should be taken in a hurry, and he heard, with satisfaction the remarks made by Lord Curzon in his speech on the Second Reading in which he pleaded for deliberation before any transfer took place. There was no fear in regard to the adoption of his Amendment from the point of view of wrecking the Union. The Amendment might be adopted and the Union would proceed as smoothly and efficiently as
<col>868</col>
without the Amendment. His Amendment would give ample time to the Union Government to look about them, to organise their Parliament and their government, to realise their situation, and to provide for the precautions that should be taken. This was a matter which should not be dealt with in a hurry. The whole question was whether it was a judicious step to require that there should be a term of years in which the new Government and the new Parliament should be able to look about them and realise where they were. There was one other consideration which ought to be impressed upon their Lordships. These Protectorates existed under the most solemn assurances which had been communicated to the inhabitants by different Colonial Secretaries. He admitted that all such declarations must be construed with reference to the conditions in which they were made and the conditions in which it was sought to apply them, and he did not think a declaration made in the past could be admitted to be an eternal bar against any transfer in the future; but it should not be done without much deliberation and ample time for the whole consideration of the problem. He therefore hoped their Lordships would see their way to enact that this period of ten years should elapse before any step was taken.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02002"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend has stated his case with his usual lucidity, and if I may I will follow his example and deal with the various Amendments together. My noble friend is not perfectly informed, I think, as to the views of the South African Governments and their delegates on this question. He told us that, so far as he knew, the South African Governments would agree either to the total omission of Clause 151 and the Schedule, or, as he thought, to the insertion of this time limit of ten years. I have no reason whatever to believe that such is the case. It is quite true that the South African Governments expressed themselves, speaking generally, willing to agree to the omission of the Schedule if Clause 151 was so altered as to make the transfer take
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0438"/>
<col>869</col>
place upon such terms as might be agreed upon at the time. I dwelt at some length, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, on what appeared to me to be the overwhelming reasons in favour of adding this Schedule and of not leaving the whole matter to be casually dealt with at such time as negotiations might be entered into between the African Union Government and His Majesty's Government here. Nor have I any reason to suppose&#x2014;indeed, quite the contrary&#x2014;that the existing South African Governments would agree to the ten years limit proposed by the noble Lord. I think that they would raise the strongest objection to the insertion of any such provision.<lb/>
From our own point of view we also object to it. If you say that no handing over shall take place for ten years, there is some case against the insertion of the Schedule at all. It might be argued, and would, I think, be argued, that if at any rate for ten years, and possibly longer, no transfer could take place, it is somewhat premature to enter into the terms of transfer as we have done in the Schedule&#x2014;a Schedule to which, as I have said, we attach the highest importance. The general effect, I think, of the Amendment would appear to be that, having safeguarded the Protectorates for the next ten years, we afterwards wash our hands of them. That is the effect which would be produced on the ordinary mind; and the South African Governments might then come and say, "Our time limit is up and we must now be allowed to take over the Protectorates on our own terms," and it is to prevent the possibility of that arising that we have asked to have the clause put in this form and to have the Schedule attached to it. I cannot say that as regards, at any rate, one of the Protectorates there will not be a request to take it over in less than ten years; nor am I in a position to say that such a request could be refused. As regards the others, I altogether decline to make any forecast as to if or when they might be or ought to be transferred to the South African Government. But so far as Swaziland is concerned, I think it is extremely probable that within a period of ten years a request will be made to add Swaziland to the Union of South Africa.<lb/>
As regards the noble Lord's further Amendment, it really only represents what
<col>870</col>
is practically certain to occur if and when any transfer is proposed. My noble friend very rightly does not attempt to give the local chiefs an absolute veto on transfer; he merely desires that they should be consulted and their wishes should be considered. Of course, they will be consulted. I cannot imagine any High Commissioner or any Government in this country who would not consider most carefully the wishes of the chiefs and the natives in such a case as that; but I should not be prepared to say that the mere expression of a preference for remaining under the direct government of this country could be taken as an absolute bar to a transfer at some future time. That preference might be very complimentary to us and might be an index to the good administration under which the particular Protectorate had been governed, but it could not of itself be taken as anything equivalent to a veto, and with that I am sure my noble friend would agree. I wish to repeat that my noble friend has been really very greatly misinformed as to the attitude of the South African Government on this question. With that fact I venture to think a very large part of his argument falls to the ground, and I must ask your Lordships not to accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EDUCATION (ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02010" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02011">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02012"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need not trouble your Lordships at any great length in asking you to give a Second Reading to this Bill. The Bill is of a purely departmental character. It has been before the House for some little time, and up to the present no serious exception has been taken to it. Should any criticisms on points of detail be forthcoming, I think they would be more appropriately and conveniently dealt with when we reach the Committee stage. I will, therefore, confine myself to a short explanatory summary of the proposals to which I ask your Lordships' assent.<lb/>
Clause 1 provides that the delegation by a local education authority of its powers under the Education Act of 1902 to its education committee shall be applicable also to the educational powers conferred by subsequent Acts, with the exception, of course, of the power of raising a rate or of borrowing money. The power of delegation under the 1902 Act has been widely exercised, but, in view of the wording of Section 17, it is open to doubt whether specific powers conferred by subsequent Statutes are powers within the meaning of the Act, and, more generally, whether a local authority can delegate any such powers which it may have acquired since 1902. By way of illustration, I may refer to the Children Act of last year. Some doubt exists whether the function of cleansing verminous children can be delegated to the education committee, as administrative convenience would naturally suggest, and the Home Office agrees with the Board of Education that in the public interest the point ought to be cleared up. The difficulty is of a purely technical nature, and this clause is designed to effect its removal.<lb/>
Clause 2 applies to the managers of provided secondary and technical schools the system of financial control and audit which the Act of 1902 imposes in the case of elementary schools. In practice it is found necessary to place sums of money at the disposal of the governors or managers of secondary and technical schools, and it
<col>872</col>
goes without saying that the expenditure of such funds should be properly controlled and audited.<lb/>
Clause 3 extends, for the purposes of higher education, the power which the Education Act of 1870 gives to two or more local education authorities to combine in the maintenance of elementary schools serving the areas of more that one authority. Administrative experience has shown the great necessity for the establishment of such machinery in the case of secondary and technical schools. I may mention that, where these combinations are effected, the accounts of the joint body will be audited as if they were a separate local education authority, unless the Local Government Board sanction an agreement to the contrary.<lb/>
Clause 4 proposes to simplify the means whereby students who enter a training college may give to the Board of Education some security that they will either follow the profession of teacher for a specified period, or will repay the money spent out of the Parliamentary grant to give them the education they receive at the college. The State has clearly the right, where it sets apart money for a specific purpose, to insist that the money shall be made to serve the object in view, and to impose conditions to that end on the persons benefiting by the expenditure. In this particular case the principal difficulty arises from the circumstance that the beneficiaries are almost invariably minors when they enter the training colleges, and that consequently, in default of statutory provisions to the contrary, agreements made with them are not enforcible at law. Prior to 1907 a declaration of intention to follow the teaching profession was usually exacted from such students, but this declaration had no legal force to bind the student, and did not in practice prove very effective, although obstacles were placed in the way of his entering the Civil Service. The Treasury were dissatisfied with the result and pressed for some amendment of the system. Since 1907 a new experiment has been tried, consisting of a tripartite agreement between the Board, the governing body of the training college, and the student, whereby the latter undertook either to serve as a teacher or to refund the money wasted on his specialised education; but in this arrangement also legal and administrative difficulties have
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0440"/>

arisen. To refer to one point only, the students being minors, it was thought desirable to make the governors of the college parties to the instrument, but, as these mostly are unincorporated bodies, great obstacles presented themselves in obtaining their adhesion to the agreement. The clause in the Bill provides a remedy by substituting a simple agreement between the Board of Education and the students, and by giving it legal force in spite of the minority of one of the contracting parties. As the details are to be embodied in the Board's Regulations, it will be possible to ventilate any grievances through the usual channels.<lb/>
Clause 5 is designed to enable a local education authority, subject to the approval of the Board of Education and the Local Government Board, to appropriate to non-educational purposes land which they hold for educational purposes. Previous Statutes, notably the Education Act of 1870 and the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act of 1907, enable education authorities to sell or lease land which they hold for educational purposes; to appropriate to the purposes of elementary education land held for the purposes of higher education, and <i>vice vers&#x00E2;</i>; to alienate educational land; and to appropriate to educational purposes land held for other purposes. This clause legalises the converse of the last-named process, and completes the series. I may mention that it is drawn on the model of Section 95 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act of 1907. Some of your Lordships will, perhaps, think that there should be a local inquiry into the conditions of any proposed appropriation, and I have no doubt that in Committee we shall be able to discuss that point and to deal with it in a manner satisfactory to those competent to express an opinion upon it. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02014"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I concur with the noble Viscount that this would not be the stage in which to deal at any length with the provisions of the Bill which he has so lucidly explained, but I think at the same time it would not be altogether out of place if I, as Minister for Education in the late Government, asked the noble Viscount to explain one or two provisions in the Bill which I do not
<col>874</col>
quite understand. Clause 1 of this Bill is introduced for the purpose of amending Section 17 of the Education Act, 1902. With that I have no fault to find; but the provision in the clause applies not only with respect to the powers conferred under the Act of 1902 but also to "any powers I connected with education conferred on the I authority or council under any other Act," except the power of raising a rate or borrowing money. I should like to ask the noble Viscount what are those other powers which are alluded to in the clause. The clause is not very clearly defined. I do not ask the question in any hostile spirit, but merely to get some idea as to what those powers are.<lb/>
Clause 5 opens up a new field. It allows the council of any county, borough, or urban district, with the consent of the Board of Education, to appropriate to other purposes land acquired originally for educational purposes only. There was a provision in the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act of 1907 enabling land acquired for the purpose of elementary education to be appropriated to the purpose of higher education, and <i>vice vers&#x00E2;.</i> That requires no comment. There was also a provision that land acquired for other purposes could be appropriated to educational purposes, but in that case the appropriation could only be with the consent of, and after inquiry by, the Local Government Board. In another case the council was allowed to alienate land acquired for the purposes of higher education, but that could only be done after inquiry by the Board of Education. I ask the noble Viscount to explain why there is this alteration in the present case, and why no inquiry is provided for in this Bill. If land were taken without inquiry for some other purpose it might be unfair to the person who sold it, or to the parishioners themselves who understood that the land was taken for one purpose only; and in my opinion an inquiry in such cases is always desirable. I think it would be advisable if the noble Viscount could see his way to introduce an Amendment in Committee to meet this point. Clause 1 of the Act of 1907 affords a precedent, for it is there provided that a local education authority may appropriate "with the consent of, and after inquiry by, the Local Government Board."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02031">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02032"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I deal with this Bill I feel that I ought to offer a word of explanation and perhaps of apology regarding another Bill which stood in my name&#x2014;the Trade Boards Bill; and I think that an explanation is particularly to be asked of me by those many Members of the House who take a deep, and, I believe, a benevolent interest in that measure. The Second Reading of that Bill has now been twice put off. I am afraid that I was the innocent cause of the postponement on Wednesday last, and I beg to offer my apologies for that. To-day the Second Reading has again been postponed and the Bill has been replaced, for reasons which, I believe, will commend themselves to your Lordships, by this Bill dealing with labour exchanges. The Government attach very great importance to both of these Bills, to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0442"/>
<col>877</col>
one as much as to the other; but there is a special reason for urgency in the case of this Bill which does not exist in the case of the other.<lb/>
This Bill deals with unemployment, and it is in the highest degree desirable that the machinery which it sets up should be in readiness to commence operations before the winter comes. I think your Lordships will appreciate that and also the reasons which have caused us to press it on. The Bill entails the establishment of a great number, I think this year some 125, of different offices with the necessary staff, and preparations for them are being pressed on as far and as fast as possible. But the House will understand that the Treasury will not part with the money necessary to enable the scheme to be in working order until the full consent of Parliament has been given, and therefore we propose to ask your Lordships to so far co-operate with us as to agree, if you approve of this Bill, to its passing through all its stages during the current week.<lb/>
I have said that this Bill deals with unemployment. I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate in any way the great distress and misery which arise from lack of work. I am sure that this House will be as ready as any other humane and thinking body of men to do anything it can to cure that evil, and I therefore assume that your Lordships will approve of the object of this Bill and that you will only require to be convinced of the desirability and the efficiency of the means by which that object is to be arrived at. There have been many attempts of late years to deal with unemployment, but perhaps the most important have been the relief works which have been started by many of the great municipalities. That, of course, is an old way of dealing with emergencies of this kind. It has been resorted to in all such emergencies. Anyone who has travelled in Ireland cannot fail to have been struck by the huge walls which surround many of the domains there. Many of your Lordships have such walls on your own property which were built in times of famine. Those works are monuments to the benevolence of your predecessors, but I am afraid they are rather expensive monuments to maintain and that they embody almost all the disadvantages of these relief works. As a rule these works are not wanted;
<col>878</col>
their cost is altogether disproportionate to the amount of relief they give, and after the emergency which they were designed to meet has subsided they continue to cost money every year. In fact, relief works cannot seriously be regarded as a cure for unemployment. At the best they are only a palliative. What is wanted is not a drug to still the pain of this disease, but a cure which will reach deep down to its roots.<lb/>
The closest study has been given to this problem, and as a result of that study a scheme has been evolved&#x2014;a practical and economical scheme, which seems to go as far as it is possible to go in the direction of the cure of unemployment. The Bill which is before the House does not contain the whole of that scheme. In fact, I doubt whether it can be said to contain half of it, but as far as it goes it contains a scheme which is complete in itself, and which, though it is an essential part of the whole, is nevertheless complete in itself and capable of doing a very great amount of good. It is proposed by this Bill to establish a network of labour exchanges all over the country. A labour exchange is really quite a simple thing. It is what its name implies&#x2014;a place where the man who wishes to buy labour will be put in touch with the man who has labour to sell. Its object is the same as that of any other exchange&#x2014;to bring buyer and seller together. That is the simplest aspect of a labour exchange, and I think that if it did nothing more than that it would amply justify its existence.<lb/>
I would ask the House to consider for a moment what happens when a man is looking for work. It surely ought not to be necessary that he should have to hawk his labour round to every likely employer in the town where he lives, or perhaps walk great distances from one town to another in search of work. As a business process one cannot imagine anything more wasteful or cumbrous than that. One can hardly imagine it; but by a stretch of imagination one may think of what might happen if there was no such thing as a Stock Exchange, and if every share that was for sale had to be hawked round the City of London in search of a possible purchaser. That is exactly what happens when a man is looking for work, and that is a thing which can very easily be prevented by a properly-arranged system
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0443"/>
<col>879</col>
of labour exchanges. It is not only the time of the man who is looking for work which is wasted, but the employer suffers also, because it often happens that an employer may require men to do some particular form of work and may not be able to obtain them, while all the time there are men seeking employment at no very great distance who are perfectly capable of doing that work. That is a state of affairs which, of course, does not arise as a rule in regard to unskilled labour, but it is by no means uncommon in skilled trades, and that is a thing, again, which could clearly be put an end to by a system of labour exchanges.<lb/>
In regard to unskilled labour the evil which has to be met is of a different nature. There are certain trades, of which the building trade is, perhaps, the best example, which give employment of a more or less intermittent character to a large number of men. Each building firm gives employment of that nature to a number of more or less unskilled labourers. Some of those men get employment which is practically regular, but there are many others who go down every day to the office or to the gate to see whether they can get a job. If trade is brisk, they are engaged; if it is slack, they are not. That sort of thing may be going on at half a dozen different builders' yards in a town, and the result is that each of them is maintaining on half rations more men than it is able to give regular employment to. That may be, to a certain extent, a convenience to those firms, though it is probable that they would be better served by men who were in receipt of regular wages, and, what is much more important, getting regular food and properly clothed and properly housed. Such men would do better work and earn their wages better. But whether it is convenient to the employers or not, I would ask your Lordships to consider what it means to the men themselves. It means that their life is made up of an alternation of full wages and of semi-starvation, and that is a state of affairs, again, where a labour exchange can come in, and where, by putting various employers in touch with each other, continuous work may be found for a number of those men and the evil of casual labour reduced to a minimum.<lb/>
Then my Lords, there are trades in which employment, as a rule, is brisk at one time
<col>880</col>
and slack at another, and here, again, the labour exchange, by a sort of process of dovetailing, will be able to arrange that men will get continuous employment, perhaps at one trade at one time of the year and at another trade at another time. As an instance of what I mean I would quote the case of building and brick-making, at which men may get work in the summer, and the same men may be found employment in gas-works and at docks in the winter. There are many other cases of the same sort. I have mentioned a very few of the more obvious uses of a labour exchange. Many others must suggest themselves to anyone who gives the matter a moment's consideration. I do not claim, of course, that this system will do anything to increase employment. Obviously it will do nothing of the kind, but what it will do will be to secure that wherever there is a vacancy for a man you will be able to put a man into it, and a vacancy will not go begging in one place while men are seeking work in another. There is another claim which can be made for this system, and that is that it will prevent any necessity for men tramping about the country in search of work, and in that way it will remove all excuse for vagrancy. That is, I think, an important consideration. The most important thing which I would urge in favour of this scheme is that it will prevent hard-working, decent men from being forced into the ranks of the unemployed and the casual labourers, as they often are at present, because the facilities for finding work for all such men will undoubtedly be increased.<lb/>
As far as the Bill itself goes, it is a short, and, I think, a simple Bill, and it does not require, as far as I can see, any explanation. What I think I ought to do is to inform the House what the Board of Trade propose to do under the regulations they are given power to make. It is proposed to set up a system of 240 exchanges&#x2014;that is ultimately &#x2014;grouped in ten principal divisions. The largest of these exchanges will be in towns of above 100,000 inhabitants, and will provide for the separate registration of several classes of workpeople, such as skilled men, labourers, and women. The smallest exchanges will be in the smaller towns of from 25,000 to 10,000 inhabitants and in the suburbs of the larger towns; and in each of the ten divisions there will be a divisional clearing house, the object of the clearing house being to receive and collate the regular
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0444"/>
<col>881</col>
returns of situations unfilled and of men unemployed at all the exchanges in the division, thus enabling the demands for labour in one place to be met, if necessary, from another place. The divisional clearing house will be linked up with a national clearing house in London. It is proposed for the present that the exchanges shall be housed in premises which shall be hired; but it will he found more convenient and economical that, at all events in the case of the larger exchanges and clearing houses, premises shall eventually be built for the purpose, and it is proposed to carry out that building programme gradually.<lb/>
The annual expenditure which this Bill will entail will amount for the present year, which, of course, is only part of a year, to &#x00A3;100,000; next year it will amount to &#x00A3;210,000 and will remain at that figure till 1912, when it is estimated that it will fall to &#x00A3;200,000, and finally in 1919&#x2013;20, when it is estimated that the building programme will be completed, the expenditure will reach its normal level, which will amount to &#x00A3;180,000. These details, my Lords, are given much more elaborately in the financial statement which has been presented to Parliament, and which I daresay your Lordships have in your hands. I have already said that this Bill contains only a part of the scheme of the Government for dealing with unemployment. The other part of that scheme is contained in the Bill which it is intended to introduce next year, but which has been announced by my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade in the other House of Parliament. My right hon. friend gave an outline of that scheme. It is not possible for me to give more than an outline myself.<lb/>
Broadly speaking, it is proposed by that scheme to establish a system of compulsory insurance to which workpeople and employers will both contribute, and to which the State will also make a contribution. It is not proposed, at present at any rate, to do more than include certain trades in which unemployment is chronic. The trades which my right hon. friend mentioned are these: house building and works of construction, engineering, machine and tool making, ship, boat, and vehicle building, including sawyers and general labourers working at those trades. That Bill and the Bill now before the House are a part of the same system. The one is the necessary
<col>882</col>
adjunct of the other. Without some system of unemployment insurance it is not possible to deal completely with unemployment; and also without some system of labour exchanges, even if those exchanges are only regarded as a test of the willingness of the men to work, it would be folly to set up any system of State-aided insurance against unemployment. By the system of labour exchanges we hope to fill all the vacancies in the country for men who are able and willing to work, and by the other system we hope to provide for those for whom perhaps no work may be able to be obtained. The remainder &#x2014;the unemployable and the unwilling&#x2014;will have to be dealt with in some other way. I imagine, and I think that it is a common idea, that that will be done by some reform in the system of Poor Law Administration. That, of course, is not a question which is. before the House, but, as everyone knows, it is a question which is receiving earnest consideration.<lb/>
This system of labour exchanges is not a new one. It has already been tried with success in London and particularly at the docks. It is in operation in half a dozen different countries on the Continent at the present time&#x2014;in France, in Germany, in Austria, in Belgium, in Switzerland, and in Norway, and I understand that its establishment is contemplated in the United States of America. There is another thing I should like to say about this system of labour exchanges. It enjoys this unique distinction, that I believe it is almost the only proposal which is to be found in both the Majority and the Minority Reports of the Poor Law Commission. This proposal has been very favourably received by both masters and men. It is a purely voluntary system. There is no compulsion whatever on anybody to use these exchanges. It is recognised that it will be most important that masters and men shall meet us on this neutral ground, and the leading trade unionists have admitted that it is extremely important that that neutral ground should exist. They are aware that if that neutrality disappears there will be many employers who will not use the exchanges, and for that reason we have been assured that trade union leaders will do their best to maintain the neutrality of these exchanges. This is not a charitable scheme; it is an economic scheme; and I recommend it to your Lordships above all on the ground that it is a practical and honest attempt to deal with a very great evil. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02034"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be glad if I might be allowed to say a few words, partly of welcome to a measure for the like of which some of us have been looking for a long time, but also, if I might, of warning against exaggerated expectations of what labour exchanges by themselves are at all likely to accomplish. So much has been said, and justly, about the necessity for labour exchanges that there have been in the minds of a great many people expectations excited as to the good that is to come from the establishment of labour exchanges which are quite certain to be falsified and to lead to widespread disappointment and disillusionment if these exchanges are allowed for any length of time to stand alone. I am sure that the Bill ought to be welcomed, and that most cordially, by this House and by the country, because it is a step in the right direction, and a sign that we have at last learned the lesson of the futility of some of the remedies to which we used to look, as, for example, the remedy of relief works. We have learned many bitter lessons as to remedies that are no true remedies. It is at least a great thing that we should be in this Bill set upon a path of reform which certainly, as far as I know, economists and social reformers of all kinds believe to be the path of real progress.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I hope we shall not, even in welcoming this Bill, allow ourselves to hide from our eyes that all that labour exchanges, even if they answer to all the best hopes of their advocates, can accomplish is something very limited, and that the institution of labour exchanges must be followed up by other measures besides that which was mentioned by the noble Lord just now as forming already part of the Government programme. Of course, what we hope from labour exchanges is that they will do something, not actually to meet the evil of unemployment, but to meet an evil which is so very closely allied to it&#x2014;that is to say, to decasualise or to regularise labour. Since I have been at work in Birmingham I think nothing has impressed my imagination with such terrific force as the vast and growing amount of casual labour. It is deplorable to hear those who know best the state of parish after parish bear witness to the fact that the area of persons who never expect to be in regular work is a growing
<col>884</col>
area. I believe that that lamentable state of things is so far true. The area of casual labour is growing, and that for certain assignable causes, and there seems to me no doubt in the world that the path of real progress is the path of ascertaining how much labour can be regularly employed. Even if the immediate result of that is that we have more and not less unemployment to deal with, I think it is better that there should be a smaller number of persons in regular work. What we have to recognise is that the institution of labour exchanges may be hoped, if they are well and wisely worked, to do something of a very real kind to decasualise labour. If that is so, then I think it is of great importance that all of us who are interested in this matter should realise that the institution of labour exchanges and anything which tends in the direction of decasualising labour must be followed up by other remedies.<lb/>
The noble Lord spoke of this as being only part, and perhaps not the larger part, of the Government programme, and he spoke of the extremely important measure which is announced of compulsory insurance against unemployment. I may say that no one in this House could welcome that proposal more cordially than I do, but I still feel that there are one or two other remedies on the necessity of which social reformers and economists of all kinds and schools are practically agreed, and which must also follow very rapidly on the heels of the institution of labour exchanges if they are not to lead to real disappointment. I will mention three. First of all, something effective must be done, and very speedily done, to resist the influx from the bottom of the great mass of untrained and unskilled labour which comes from the improper or unwise employment of boys. I do not think anyone can really contemplate the social situation at the present moment without seeing the disaster which comes from the extraordinary facility with which boys at the age of fourteen can get into posts by which they are enabled to earn small wages, which, of course, they and their parents hail with great enthusiasm; but when they are seventeen or eighteen they are turned out without any skill, without any real preparation for taking a permanent place in life, inevitably to swell the ranks of casual labour and to look forward to life without any hope of obtaining a permanent place. I have been very much struck with the evidence of those
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0446"/>
<col>885</col>
who have had close experience of the vast number of boys who, at the age of seventeen or eighteen, have not really any hope or expectation of doing anything else except picking up a job.<lb/>
For the last two or three days I have been acting as chaplain to the Warwickshire Territorials in their camp in the New Forset, and I talked to a good many of the lads of eighteen who were there. The very facility with which they had been able to come to camp was due in part to the lamentable cause of slackness of employment. It was pathetic to see so many who were in casual employment, and there is no doubt that one of the very first things we have to do is to dam the influx of totally unskilled labour from the ranks of boyhood. I do earnestly hope that His Majesty's Government intend at an early date to take the step which it seems to me social reformers of all kinds are now urging upon us, and that is to raise the age of compulsory schooling and to continue compulsory training at night in such a manner as shall do something to put boys into a more effective path towards skilled permanent labour. I do earnestly hope that none of us who are interested in this project of labour exchanges will fail to see that one great part they are qualified to play in decasualising labour they will be unable to do unless we are at the same time diminishing the influx of totally unskilled labour from the unregulated condition of the boy market.<lb/>
Secondly, I hope His Majesty's Government are really prepared at an early date for the establishment of detention colonies for those who are proved&#x2014;awl we shall have now, with the assistance of the labour exchanges, better opportunities of putting them to the proof&#x2014;to be what the Germans call "work-shy." That, again, is a matter which is pressed upon us by reformers and economists of all kinds. It is hardly realised how great an invasion of the liberty of the subject it will be, but I think it is an invasion which ought to be altogether hopeful in its results. I venture to put that second among the other remedies not mentioned by the noble Lord which are quite essential, and which must follow upon the institution of labour exchanges if such exchanges are not to lead to disappointment, disillusionment, and reaction.<lb/>
The third is the institution of training
<col>886</col>
colonies for those whom the labour exchanges reveal to be necessarily for the time out of work because there is no work for them, but with regard to whom there is no reason to believe that they are not willing to work when work can be found. I venture to think that a great deal could be done if there were training colonies for such persons, where the interval in which they are out of work could be used, either in teaching them some new trade, or making them more efficient in the trade which they at present exercise, and I do not doubt that money expended on that line would be money profitably spent. I do not wish to do more than welcome very cordially the institution of labour exchanges, but at the same time to give voice to what is in the minds of a great many people who are interested&#x2014;namely, to the fear that undue hopes may be excited as to what labour exchanges of themselves can do; and while we greet with the greatest satisfaction the statement of the Government that it is only half their programme, I hope it will not be forgotten that besides the other half there are measures which are absolutely necessary if the institution of labour exchanges is not to prove deficient in the results for which those who have longed for such an institution are constrained to hope.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02035"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that no one could have listened to the eloquent speech of the right reverend Prelate who has just sat down but must have been tempted to go into a far wider field on this subject than perhaps there is time to enter upon on the present occasion. He touched on the most critical problems which await solution in respect of the reform of the Poor Law and social reform generally. I am not qualified, even if I thought it were suitable, to follow him in all his most interesting remarks, but I cannot refrain from adding my humble testimony to the enormous importance, as it appears to some of us, of dealing without delay with boys who are being brought up in so unsatisfactory a manner for their subsequent battle in life.<lb/>
I would add to what the right reverend Prelate has said this further remark, that what is borne in upon us by all the evidence is the complete failure of the educational policy of this country to deal with this problem. I often think when we have education debates in your Lordships'
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0447"/>
<col>887</col>
House and in another place, and when Minister after Minister comes before Parliament with the demand for untold millions and with an air of confidence that they never can be refused, that these gentlemen scarcely realise how profoundly upon its trial the whole educational system of this country really is. When the present educational system was introduced confident prophecies were made that it would banish all sorts of social evils; those prophecies have completely vanished, and now we are face to face with more misery and more poverty than when the Education Acts were passed. I earnestly hope that the eloquent words of the right rev. Prelate will not fall upon an infertile soil. I for one should welcome a change in the Education Acts, not only in the direction of a reform of the curriculum, but also in prolonging the age at which children are kept at school. I have always been in favour of evening continuation schools and not of prolonging the age in respect of day schools, and for this reason, that it is evident that you would meet with great resistance&#x2014;I think legitimate resistance&#x2014;on the part of the people of this country if after their children had reached an earning age they were precluded from earning money. That difficulty does not present itself in evening continuation schools, and the great waste that now takes place might thereby be spared.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate has impressed upon us that this measure for the establishment of labour exchanges will have only a limited effect. That is no doubt true, but that does not in any way diminish my approval of the Bill as a whole. I do not think we must look to violent changes. Slight improvements are all that we can expect, and if this Bill makes a slight improvement we ought to be thoroughly satisfied. I think the noble Lord who introduced this Bill was justified in saying that the establishment of labour exchanges meets with general approval. He said it was the only point on which the Majority and the Minority Reports of the Poor Law Commission agreed. I think the noble Lord did less than justice, if I may say so, to those two wonderful documents, and I think it will be found that there are a good many points upon which they agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02036"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: I
<col>888</col>
said it was one of the few points on which they agreed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02037"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I entirely accept the noble Lord's correction. This is one of the points on which they agree. I go a step further than the noble Lord and say that I think this Bill will even tend to increase employment. I think that a better distribution of labour and an increase of supply where it is required will no doubt tend to the general prosperity of the country and the improvement of the conditions of labour as a whole. But I think your Lordships will agree that, this Bill is rather skeleton in form, and does not very clearly upon the face of it explain the method by which it is to be carried out. Like many other Bills introduced nowadays, this Bill is really to be carried into effect by regulation; and I thought we had every reason to be grateful to the noble Lord that he was good enough to add a little flesh and skin to the skeleton which the document itself presents to us by detailing some of the regulations that the Board of Trade propose to establish in pursuance of this Bill when it becomes an Act of Parliament. But I am to some extent a little doubtful as to the working of the Bill. There was one point on which the noble Lord did not dwell. I understand that the proposal is to carry on these labour exchanges as national and not as local institutions&#x2014;that is to say, that the whole of the authority under which the Bill is to be worked is national, that it is to be worked by the Board of Trade and not by or with the assistance of any local authority whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02038"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: That is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02039"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: And although I do not think that, in terms, the existing labour exchanges such as there are, are abolished, yet it is proposed that no future such exchanges shall be established. The Bill may even go further than I have stated, but at any rate labour exchanges which exist at present under the control of local authorities are not to be any further encouraged. If, then, this system is to be a national system, its finance is to be national, and the financial clauses, if I may say so, are rather incomplete. I do not feel quite certain what expenditure is authorised under Clause 4. It appears that certain what
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0448"/>
<col>889</col>
may be called administrative expenditure is authorised, but one of the most important provisions of the Bill, though that in itself is rather sketchy, which is, as it were, hinted at in Clause 2, is the power to aid workmen who have to travel from one place to another in order to take up a particular job. I do not find any direct authority in Clause 4 authorising this expenditure, but perhaps when another member of the Government addresses us he will explain how that may be carried out. In the same way the drafting of Clause 2 seems to be of rather an incomplete character. I see that the Board of Trade may, with the consent of the Treasury, authorise advances to be made by way of loan, but the Bill does not say to whom the loan is to be made. On the face of it, one would think it was a loan from the central authority to the particular labour exchange, but I gather from other sources that what is intended is really a loan by the labour exchange to the workman who wishes to travel from one place to another. That is so, I have no doubt, but I think the noble Lord will agree that the phrasing of the clauses is not very complete.<lb/>
The same kind of criticism applies to other parts of the Bill, especially to subsection (2) of Clause 2 as it now stands. That is a subsection which was not in the original Bill as it was introduced in the House of Commons, but was inserted in the course of its passage through that House, and it is a provision which, as your Lordships will recognise, deals with matters of great complexity and delicacy. I hope that when the noble Earl the Leader of the House speaks, if he is going to speak, he will tell us what is really intended by subsection (2) of Clause 2. This is the provision which says that&#x2014;
<quote>"The regulations shall provide that no person shall suffer any disqualification or be otherwise prejudiced on account of refusing to accept employment found for him through a labour exchange where the ground of refusal is that a trade dispute exists, or that the wages offered are lower than those current in the trade in the district where the employment is offered."</quote>
I do not pretend for a moment that I do not understand the general intention of that subsection, but I think it is important that the Government should explain exactly what their policy is in that respect. The general intention, no doubt, is to prevent the operation of this Bill affecting
<col>890</col>
trade disputes. Taken in that general sense it is a very natural provision to insert in such a Bill as the present. I do not think any of your Lordships would desire that these labour exchanges should be used as a weapon on the one side or the other in trade disputes; but it must be admitted that the particular language used is very vague and seems to carry us a long way.<lb/>
I should like in that connection to make this observation. As I understand, these labour exchanges are to be managed by a committee consisting of equal numbers of employers and workmen, with a neutral chairman. Therefore, the workmen, who are to be representative, as I understand, of local trade unions, will have a very important position in administering the Act. I am not sorry. On the contrary, I am glad. I think it is proper that both the interests into which the industrial world is divided should be represented on the committees which are to manage these labour exchanges, and I am in hopes that the trade union representatives themselves will profit by the experience which they will thus gain. There appears to be a profound dread existing lest any provision in such a Bill as this should tend to lower the rate of wages. I am not surprised. When one looks back at the history of trade unions and sees the great battles which they most properly and successfully fought for their own interests and for the interests of their fellow workmen in years gone by, one is not surprised that they should shrink from any legislation which might have the effect of lowering the rate of wages. I have always spoken with profound respect of trade unions. I believe they have done splendid work in the industrial world, and I believe that the fact of the organisation of labour is in itself a tremendous benefit to the community, because it enables the community as a whole to deal with labour questions with some hope that they will be disposed of, because you have a settled organisation with whom to deal.<lb/>
But, at the same time, one cannot help feeling that there are occasions when this dread of any legislation which may affect wages may carry us rather too far. For what will be the natural operation of such a Bill as this? You will have a place where there are workmen of a particular trade who cannot get a job. There will be another
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0449"/>
<col>891</col>
place where there will be particular jobs of that trade to be done and not sufficient workmen to do them, and the labour exchange will have the effect of transferring the surplus workmen to the place where there is a demand for them. The effect undoubtedly will be to, I hope, raise the wages in the place from which the workmen come, for it will reduce the surplus labour; but it will also undoubtedly have some effect towards lowering the wages in the place to which they go, because they will fill a demand for labour which otherwise would not be filled. I do not think we ought to shrink from that consequence. I cannot help hoping that the trade unions will take the same view, and that they will see that in the administration of a great national system it is right and proper that where there is a demand for labour in a particular part of England and a surplus of labour in another part, the surplus ought to be transferred to where there is a demand notwithstanding any effect it may have upon the rate of wages.<lb/>
I am specially tempted to make these observations because it has always seemed to me a very doubtful policy on the part of the Labour leaders to resist variation in the rate of wages when they have to deal with workmen different in calibre and ability. All of us know that as men grow older they cannot do quite as good work as when they were in their prime. Properly considered, these men should receive a lower rate of wages, but as the trade unions will not allow them to accept lower wages the result is that these men receive no wages at all and they help to increase the ranks of the unemployed. I believe that this policy of casting out workmen who are past their prime and no longer able to earn the full rate of wages of fully effective workmen has been carried a very long way and has been seen even in Government Departments. I have heard&#x2014;I do not know whether it is authentic&#x2014;of workmen being turned out of Woolwich Dockyard at an age when they were beginning to go a short way down the hill. I hope that when the trade union leaders find themselves upon these labour exchange committees brought face to face with these problems from the point of view of workmen out of employment through no fault of their own, but because they are past their prime, they will become convinced that this rigid policy of maintaining in all
<col>892</col>
circumstances and in all cases a fixed point below which wages should never be allowed to fall is a great as well as a cruel mistake, and is contrary to the public int rests.<lb/>
While I welcome most warmly the introduction of this Bill and hope that your Lordships will pass it into law, I trust that His Majesty's Government may be able to give us some explanation as to how they think Clause 2, and especially subsection (2) of that clause, is intended to work. As for the actual prospects of this Bill, I am quite sure I may say on behalf of my noble friend who sits beside me&#x2014;indeed I say it with his authority&#x2014;that we shall offer no hindrance to the rapid passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House. A certain limited amount of delay is necessary in order to insert any Amendments that might be thought necessary, but within that limit every facility will be given to His Majesty's Government in order to carry it into effect. I conclude by congratulating the noble Lord on the introduction of the Bill and the facility with which he explained it to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02040"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am sure that the noble Lord who introduced the Bill and His Majesty's Government must feel encouraged by the reception which the Bill has received. I think the discussion to-night has been of real value and interest, not only for its own sake but also because of the evidence it will give to all who are interested in this subject, and who, perhaps, have hardly realised the difficulty which attends legislation respecting it, that they must take one step at a time towards the solution of the problem. That this Bill by itself could produce momentous results scarcely anyone would, I imagine, be prepared to maintain; but when followed by other Bills such as those which were sketched, and by the treatment of the other subjects referred to by my right reverend brother the Bishop of Birmingham, I have no doubt that the legislation will produce a vast effect upon the difficulties with which we are at present face to face.<lb/>
But it is worth noting that in all these matters we are face to face with this difficulty. When we attempt to deal with this subject as a whole, as soon as the initial discussion is raised we find it to be so vast that its solution would take, not one Bill,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0450"/>
<col>893</col>
but half-a-dozen Bills. On the other hand, we are deterred from taking one of these steps by itself because it seems hardly by itself worth a great deal of effort. It is because I believe that this Bill will fit in with other things that I welcome it with special cordiality to-night. The noble Marquess drew a gloomy picture of our educational system. That the educational prospects of forty years ago and the hopes founded on them by reformers have been altogether falsified I am not prepared to say, any more than I can agree with the view of the noble Marquess that there is more poverty and misery now than prevailed forty years ago. I am convinced that the contrary could be shown to be the case, and that where more misery and more poverty do exist they are attributable to other causes than the failure of our educational policy. That our educational policy needs amending I most cordially and firmly believe, but whether it should be amended exactly in the direction sketched by the noble Marquess I am not quite sure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02041"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I was only referring to a remarkable passage in the Majority Report, with which, no doubt, the most reverend Primate is familiar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02042"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am familiar with that passage, and it was one of the points on which I had hoped to dwell in the course of a discussion which I had looked forward to raising tomorrow. But to meet the general convenience of the House this discussion will not take place till later, and I will await that opportunity to expound my views on the particular point to which the noble Marquess called attention. The whole subject, indeed, of which this Bill deals with a small portion, must necessarily be touched upon in any adequate discussion on Poor Law reform as a whole. But at present I enter a <i>caveat</i> of objection as to the words of the noble Lord who introduced the Bill when he spoke of the few points on which the whole of that great Commission is practically unanimous. I shall be prepared to show when the time comes, and I think conclusively to show, that in respect of the larger principles which are at stake the recommendations are practically one. But that is a big subject into which I will not enter now, although I hope to have an opportunity of doing so before very long. All that I desire to do to-night is to congratulate His Majesty's Government and to say
<col>894</col>
how cordially I for one welcome this measure as part of a greater whole. I am certain that the subject will require treatment in more directions than one before this Bill fits in its proper place if we are to get a coherent and unified system dealing with, on wise lines, some of the larger problems with which we are confronted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02043"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend has no reason to complain of the reception of this Bill. On the contrary, the reception has been all through of a cordial character. It is partly, perhaps, due to the fact that the discussion has wandered in some respects a considerable distance from the Bill itself, but it is no doubt also due to the fact, which every speaker has emphasised, that this meaure forms only one part of a great scheme. I cordially agree with what has been said by the most rev. Primate, that there always is a difficulty in dealing with these slices of a great subject. It is impossible, by common consent, in any session of Parliament to deal with the whole subject of the Poor Law and kindred matters, whereas a single attempt to deal with one particular aspect such as is represented in this Bill may lie in some degree open to the imputation of being imperfect. But I am very glad that the House has so thoroughly understood that this is one step in the direction of what we hope may be a solution of the entire matter, and that it has been received in that spirit.<lb/>
Both the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham and the noble Marquess opposite dealt for a time with some of the questions, educational and others, which are germane to this subject. The question of boy labour, one of the most difficult, as I should think, to deal with, was dealt with by both. It seems sometimes to be concluded, though it was not either by the right rev. Prelate or by the noble Marquess, that this question of boy labour, relatively well paid for a time and then ceasing altogether, is a simple one to cure. It seems to me to be one of the most difficult sides of the problem. Those noble Lords who are in the habit of indulging in the game of golf sometimes, I think, pause to reflect what is to be the future career of the active and intelligent little boy who is carrying their clubs. We see also the no less active and intelligent boy messengers belonging to institutions and also a large number in private employment, and we wonder what their future is to be. It is impossible to prohibit that kind of
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0451"/>
<col>895</col>
labour, at least so it seems, and its regulation undoubtedly is a subject of the very greatest difficulty. The noble Marquess, I gather, looks for help on this branch of the subject from further development of continuation schools, and I venture to assume that he is not one of those who would object to at any rate some application of the principle of compulsion as far as they are concerned. The right rev. Prelate, who is not now in the House, the Bishop of Hereford, has more than once attempted, as your Lordships know, to deal with this question by a Bill, and I think it has generally been the case when he has brought it forward that he has received a great deal of sympathy; but it has been generally pointed out that public opinion in the country is not ripe for such a change. I think there is some reason to hope that it is ripening in that direction, and I, for one, trust that before very long by common agreement more may be done in that direction than anybody has yet ventured to attempt.<lb/>
Then the right reverend Prelate asked whether other Poor Law questions, such as detention colonies for those who will not work and training colleges for those who would like to work but cannot get work, form part of the programme of His Majesty's Government. I am sure the right reverend Prelate will forgive me if I do not attempt to give him any definite answer to that question, because I might be holding out hopes for the production of particular measures which it might not be possible to fulfil, and therefore, although unintentionally, misleading the right reverend Prelate and the House. But, of course, it is true that we have the whole subject in our minds, and we shall do our best to produce proposals dealing with it generally. As regards the Bill itself, the noble Marquess, as I said, treated it very kindly. My noble friend behind me said that the Bill could not be expected to create labour but merely to organise it, and the noble Marquess generously went a little further than my noble friend and seemed to think that in some respects it might do something in the direction of even creating labour. I am disposed there to agree with the noble Marquess opposite, because I can quite conceive cases where, while it would not actually create labour, it might have the effect of accelerating the doing of work which might otherwise be postponed. I can imagine cases in connection with public authorities and private individuals where
<col>896</col>
the certain knowledge that you could get the particular kind of labour you required would be a distinct inducement to begin work which might otherwise be postponed.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said that the Bill was in something of skeleton form; that, no doubt, is perfectly true; and he asked one or two questions on matters which he thought my noble friend had not entirely cleared up. He said he understood&#x2014;and rightly understood, indeed&#x2014;that the Bill was to be carried out by the national authority of the Board of Trade, and he asked how the finance of the Bill, especially with relation to Clauses 2 and 4, was to be worked. I am sure the noble Marquess will not expect me to give a definite answer to that question, but my noble friend will, of course, have noted what he said and will see whether the intention of the Bill, which is clear enough, is properly carried out in the wording of the clauses. Then the noble Marquess asked a question with regard to subsection (2) of Clause 2, which, as he said, was inserted in the course of the passage of the Bill in another place. The fear, I take it, that was felt by those who speak for labour was that these exchanges might, in certain circumstances, conceivably become offices for obtaining what they would call blackleg labour, and it was to meet that, in part, at any rate, I take it, that the provision was inserted. What they desire to avoid is that any man should be placed on an employers' black-list because he refuses to work under the conditions set forth in the subsection. That, I think, is a reasonable provision, and I do not understand that the noble Magness objected to it as such.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02044"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Earl say that the disqualification or the prejudice contemplated is that the workman might not be afterwards well treated by particular employers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02045"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: No; it is that he should not be prejudiced in obtaining future work through the exchange. Of course, the exchange cannot tell what may happen to a workman who engages in work at some future time, but the desire is that so far as the exchange is concerned he may not be prejudiced in any way by the fact that he has refused work under certain conditions. Then the noble Marquess asked about the committee. He went, I think, perhaps a little beyond the mark in describing this committee as having duties
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0452"/>
<col>897</col>
of an administrative character. Speaking generally, the committee is of an advisory character, because the actual administration of the exchange in the last resort belongs to the central authority; and I might add that the creation of these advisory committees seems to me of itself to be a very good thing, because there is no reason why they should not be able to exercise other functions of an important character relating to labour, possibly, for instance, the settlement of local labour disputes or matters of that kind, composed, as they will he, of representatives both of employers and of employed.<lb/>
Towards the close of his speech the noble Marquess entered a <i>caveat</i> against what he conceived to be the excessive rigidity of the trade unions in the matter of wages, and he expressed, I think, the hope that the establishment of these labour exchanges might do something to induce a greater elasticity in that respect, and especially in relation to the possibility of differentiating wages as between the older men whose work is supposed to be not so valuable and those in the full activity of life. I confess I do not exactly share the noble Marquess's view as to this particular result following the establishment of a labour exchange. I think he dwelt excessively, if I may say so, on the supposed economic result upon wages of the flow of labour from one district into another. Economically, no doubt, the result which he foretold would follow; but, as a matter of fact, in a country like this, where, so far as most trades are concerned, there is a standard rate of wages, I should have thought that the effect, if it followed at all, would only follow to a very limited extent, and in certain trades not very highly organised; and with regard to the special point which he mentioned of the wages of older men, it does not seem particularly likely that the special influx of labour into a particular district caused by the existence of a labour exchange would be wholly composed, or even mainly composed, of men who would he prepared to work, perhaps, and who, in the noble Marquess' opinion, ought to work, at the lower rate of wages. I confess I do not, therefore, entirely see the bearing of that particular question on the establishment of these exchanges. It only remains for me to repeat that my noble friend and I are very grateful for the really unqualified approval which this measure has received, and we certainly do not complain of the
<col>898</col>
pointing out by noble Lords opposite, and by right reverend Prelates that it is only a part of a great whole, but as such, and within its limits, we hope that its operations will be of real value to the country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SETTLERS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02047"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government the Question standing on the Paper in my name&#x2014;viz.: what are the conditions under which settlers under existing Settlers' Ordinances hold land (<i>a</i>) in the Transvaal; (<i>b</i>) in the Orange River Colony.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02048"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Question is in its form a simple question because the information asked for is really at the disposal of the public; but I imagine that what the noble Earl desires me to do is to say something in general about the position of the settlers in the Transvaal and in the Orange River Colony. The system of settlement was established in both colonies on a similar basis in the year 1902. The arrangements were these. If land was offered on lease, it was let for five years at a rent which did not exceed five per cent. of its estimated value. In the Transvaal that lease might be extended for a further period of two years, and in the Orange River Colony for a further period of five or ten years. On the other hand, a licence might be taken out to purchase the land. In that case the settler purchased by sixty half-yearly payments extending over thirty years, paying four per cent. interest and 1&#x00BE; instalment of the capital sum.<lb/>
In the Transvaal in 1907 a change was made, and the amendment gave two advantages to the settler. It enabled him, in the first place, to convert the terms under which he held on licence to the terms of a lease, and it gave him a chance of having his farm revalued. In the Transvaal the practice had been to charge under a lease of five years one and a quarter per cent. for the first two years, and two and a half per cent, for the last three years. Your Lordships will see that under a lease the settler paid considerably less than he paid
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0453"/>
<col>899</col>
under a licence. In 1907 legislation in the Transvaal made leases renewable for five years more, and it gave the lessee the right to obtain a full Crown grant any time on paying the full value of the holding. It also enabled him, if he chose still to hold under licence, to spread his payments over fifty years instead of thirty. The practical result of that was that by far the greater part of the Transvaal settlers elected to take leases. But it is important to know that that choice cannot be exercised as a right; it can only be exercised under the authority of the Minister of Lands.<lb/>
In 1907 there was also some amending legislation in the Orange River Colony. The purchaser, instead of going on paying 5&#x00BE; per cent. all through, was allowed to pay at the rate of 4 per cent. for the rest of his thirty years, and to pay off the balance of the instalments of his capital as he might find it convenient during the period. In the Orange River Colony I believe that practically all the land&#x2014;certainly the greatest part of it&#x2014;is held on the purchase system. It is the desire there to acquire the land outright. Settlers there are now in a position to acquire their holdings after five years by paying down the remainder of the purchase money, whereas in the Transvaal the holdings cannot be acquired under ten years residence.<lb/>
There is this important difference between the positions in the two colonies. In the Transvaal revaluation was provided for, but it had not been provided for in the Orange River Colony. Under the 1902 Ordinance of the Transvaal, a leaseholder desiring to purchase could ask for a revaluation if he thought the price was too high; but, as a matter of fact, the Commissioner or the Minister of Lands was not bound to carry out this revaluation. He might, if he liked, offer the holding to another applicant at the original price. Then in 1907 further powers of revaluation were given, and the Board might, with the consent of the Minister, grant revaluation on the application of any settlers. As a matter of fact, that was very largely done in the Tranvaal by general agreement, with the result that, speaking generally, no question arises as regards the settlers in the Transvaal. I do not think I need describe the provisions by which the settlers are tied, although in some ways they are onerous. It is only fair to mention that they exist in order to show that these
<col>900</col>
settlers do not stand exactly in the position of ordinary farmers. They are bound to reside for a very large part of the year&#x2014;in the one case I think they may be absent only three months, and in the other four months&#x2014;upon their holdings, and they have no mineral rights.<lb/>
As to the present position of the settlers in the Orange River Colony, some difference of opinion has been expressed as to the proper method of dealing with the difficulties under which some of them at any rate have laboured. As your Lordships know, they are under the administration of a Land Board. I ought, perhaps, to make it clear that the position of His Majesty's Government in this matter is not one where any direct interference is possible. By the Letters Patent the care of the settlers is handed over partly to the Governor and partly to the Land Board, and so far it is out of our hands altogether. But, of course, that does not preclude us from doing what we desire to do&#x2014;to take a friendly interest in their fortunes. They were placed there under special circumstances which are well known to your Lordships, and, therefore, as far as we are able in any way to advance their interests, of course we are glad to do so.<lb/>
I am bound to say that the question of the position of these settlers is one of the most puzzling that has come before me during my tenure of my present office. One suggestion that has been made is that the complete Transvaal terms might be applied, of course by agreement with the Orange River Government, to settlers there. But I think if those terms were applied in their entirety they would not, for more reasons than one, be acceptable to the whole of the Orange River settlers. That is one suggestion. Then we have to consider what the policy of the Land Board has been. It is not, as I understand it, the opinion of the Land Board that the settlers as a whole desire revaluation. The policy of the Land Board hitherto when times have been hard, as they have, has been to remit rents. In a considerable number of cases they have from the funds at their disposal allowed a three years free occupation of the holding in the hope that that might enable the settlers to pull round. Lately&#x2014;and I think the noble Lord will confirm what I say if he speaks&#x2014;the prospects of at any rate a very large number of the settlers have been distinctly bettered. They have had better times and are altogether

in better heart. I am also quite certain that the noble Lord will agree that it is bad policy, that it is no kindness to anybody and an altogether thoroughly disadvantageous thing to do, to attempt to bolster up any who may be incompetent by assistance from public funds.<lb/>
The real question is what prospect is there of a large body of these people being able to get on their feet before the Land Board comes to an end in 1912, with the prospect of their coming, as they will, under the Union Government and being able, in due course, to become purchasers of their holdings. I should hope, as far as regards a very considerable number of them, that that happy consummation would follow without anything further being done. But it is no doubt a question whether the funds at the disposal of the Land Board are sufficient to enable them to carry out improvements and make remissions. I have had various friendly communications on this subject with those who are entitled to speak for the Orange River Colony, and I hope to have more; but whether it will be possible to find from any source any further funds, should such funds be needed, I am not in a position now to say. I believe that the sum required to make the position of all those settlers who are in a tolerably sound position really secure would not be a large one, and I am sorry I am not able to give my noble friend any definite figure on that point. I hope, however, that later in the session, if he raises the subject again, I may be able to tell him something more definite. I can assure him that the subject, as I have said, is one of the most puzzling I have had to do with; it has my constant attention, and as far as it is possible for me to suggest any remedy I certainly will do my best to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02049"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I desire to thank the noble Earl for his sympathetic interest in the cause of the settlers, but I think it has come out pretty clearly from what he has said that although the settlement of the question has been going on now for three years there does not appear any immediate prospect of anything being done, and that at the present moment His Majesty's Government do not seem to have any plan. On the one side, which I will call for the moment the Dutch side, people have pretty definite clear-cut ideas of what they want, while on this side, the Imperial side, no opinions have held water for more
<col>902</col>
than a day at a time. The Ridgeway Commission went out with a definite promise from the Government that they were going to inquire into the whole of the settler problem. What happened? The settlers met the Commission out there and sent in certain statements. The Ridgeway Commission returned to this country and the subject was afterwards debated at some length in your Lordships' House, but we failed to extract a single fact regarding the settlers, and we now know that the portion of the Ridgeway Report devoted to the subject of the settlers was embraced in about six lines.<lb/>
We were told at the time the Orange River Colony settlements were made that the settlers were going to be looked after. We now hear from the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies that there are no funds. We stated that fact on this side of the House three years ago. Then there was another attempt made, at the time of the &#x00A3;4,000,000 loan, to redress this real grievance. Lord Selborne stated that the Home Government had a distinct duty to perform to these settlers, and it was his wish to take a certain portion of that money for redressing their just grievances. But not a fraction of that &#x00A3;4,000,000 loan went into the settlers' pockets. Six months ago a deputation of settlers from the Orange River Colony came over here to get some redress of their grievances. They were listened to sympathetically, but nothing has been done, and I believe nothing will be done for these settlers.<lb/>
There are certain definite things the settlers want. In the Transvaal, as the noble Earl stated, they are allowed to have their farms for two years at one and a-quarter per cent. of the purchase price and for a further three years at two and a-half per cent. In the Orange River Colony they have to pay four per cent. of the purchase price on their farms. The settlers in the Orange River Colony wish to have the rate of interest on their land reduced to the same figure as is paid in the Transvaal. In 1912 they know they will be handed over to the tender mercies of another Government, and they wish to be thoroughly settled on the land before the transfer. I think a more reasonable request could hardly be put forward; moreover, when these terms are granted in the Transvaal it is only fair that the settlers in the Orange
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0455"/>
<col>903</col>
River Colony should get them also. Then there is the question of revaluation. After the war farms were transferred at inflated prices. Land has since gone down in value, and the settlers wish to have a revaluation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02050"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Lord ask for a revaluation in the name of the settlers on all the farms in the Orange River Colony?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02051"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I do not ask for revaluation where a definite deal has been made. I think where there has been a definite bargain they would not like revaluation. Those cases are very few compared to the total number of farms. The farms were very much overvalued. The next point is the question of the revision of the Ordinance. The Ordinance lays down that the settlers can only leave their farms for three months. It would be rather ludicrous when a man had paid two-thirds of the purchase price of his farm that he should be turned out because he had left his farm for more than three months. Equally unsound it must be that the Governor in Council is empowered to readjust terms. There are other points which require that the whole of the Land Settlement Ordinance for the Orange River Colony should be gone into and revised. The other point I wish to bring out is this, Who is going to pay for this? At present the Land Settlement Board in the Orange River Colony has only about &#x00A3;40,000 a year to spend on necessary works and to carry on the administration. If the rate of interest is reduced from four per cent. to one and a-half per cent. they will be left with between &#x00A3;15,000 and &#x00A3;25,000 to carry on the administration, and therefore it would be necessary that some money should be forthcoming to make up the difference between that amount and the &#x00A3;40,000.<lb/>
The Ministerial organ of the Orange River Colony, the <i>Bloemfontein Friend</i>, stated recently that the whole policy of land settlement was not one they particularly cared for; they saw no reason Why the Orange River Colony should pay this money, and they looked to His Majesty's Government to make up the difference. The article concluded by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"The Old population may say, Is it our duty to save the settlers from their self-preferred Land
<col>904</col>
Board and the contracts they have voluntarily signed? If we do nothing, in a short time the few settlers will have left. Shall we not be satisfied, after they have left, in placing our own people upon the land on such terms as we please?"</quote>
That shows the definite policy which these people have. I wish we could say that our Government had anything like so definite a policy. I shall bring the matter up again at a later period of the session, when my Question will take the form of asking exactly what His Majesty's Government intend to do. A very large proportion of the settlers will certainly stick it out if they can possibly do so. I agree that there can be no object in keeping bad men on the land; but the settlers who served us through the war and have since worked through five bad seasons ought to have something done for them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02052"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was so much interested in the noble Lord's statement that I did not point out that he was not in order. He should have made his speech in asking the Question and not by way of reply, as he did not conclude with any formal Motion. There is one point I wish to make clear. The funds of the Land Board have been largely used in the direction of trying to make the valuations more uniform by spending, free of charge to the tenant, large sums of money in sinking wells and otherwise improving the farms which were considered to be too highly valued in order to bring their value up to the nominal valuations. I think it only fair to mention that.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE SHORTAGE OF CAVALRY HORSES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02053"><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask whether it is a fact that in consequence of the shortage of horses the Divisional Transport and Supply Park had to be omitted in the experiment of the mobilisation of one of the four Divisions at Aldershot during last week. The reason I put this Question on the Paper is that it illustrates the very unsatisfactory condition of the horse question to which I have called attention on one or two previous occasions in your Lordships' House. It is an object lesson which I think will bring home to your Lordships the state of the horse problem at the present moment. According to the newspapers, the Supply Park and Divisional Transport had to be left behind last week because of the shortage of horses. According to <i>The Times</i>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0456"/>
<col>905</col>
Correspondent, the establishment of horses for a Division is 7,504, but the number actually on parade last week was only 6,854, or a shortage of 650. The number of vehicles, which should have been 1,130, was actually only 946&#x2014;a deficiency of 184.<lb/>
It is said that the reason why the requisite horses could not be obtained for the Divisional Transport and Supply Park was that they were engaged by the Territorials. This means that in ease of real mobilisation the horses would be taken, and rightly taken, by the Regulars, and that the Territorials would have to go without horses altogether. As an example of what happened last week, I may mention that the Territorial medicals had to lend their horses to the Royal Army Medical Corps to fill up their numbers. This seems to me to be a strange commentary on the Aldershot Command, which is supposed to have two Divisions always ready for war. Many of these horses, I am also told, were very thin and unsuitable for the work they had to do. As a further evidence of Territorials not getting their horses, I would quote from the report of a meeting which took place on Saturday of a branch of the Imperial Horse Society at Colchester, at which the Master of the Essex and Suffolk Hounds, said, with regard to the supply of horses&#x2014;
<quote>"Whenever the Regular Army wanted horses the Territorials would have none at all. Indeed, there were not enough horses to mount the Regulars."</quote>
I venture to submit that the principle of three men to one horse is absolutely unsound and is bound to break down when the pinch comes. The Yeomanry, especially those in the South and in London, have not much more than one-third of their own horses. I read a comment upon this in one of the newspapers this morning, and if it were not so serious it would be really amusing. The newspaper observed&#x2014;
<quote>"The Yeomanry horses are nearly all supplied by contractors and come mostly front between the shafts of London cabs. The young City Yeoman sometimes recognises in the horse he is riding in the field the animal behind which he was driven to Waterloo."</quote>
I shall be told, of course, that this is all a question of money, and that it would have been quite possible to hire the requisite number of horses if the Government had thought it worth while. I should
<col>906</col>
like to point out that the amount spent for the encouragement of horse breeding in this country is about &#x00A3;5,000 a year, whereas a country like Austria spends &#x00A3;370,000, and most of the other Continental countries spend in a similar ratio. Surely if we have, as was announced last night, a sum of &#x00A3;78,000 put away to provide aeroplanes, we might have a little more money put down for horses.<lb/>
The question of horses seems to occupy the attention not only of the War Office, but also of the Board of Agriculture, and the noble Earl the President of that Board told us on a former occasion that he had a well-thought-out scheme, and that if the Treasury would supply the money he would be able to do something for the Army. That at the time was a very big "if," but I hope that the noble Earl will be able to give us some satisfaction on that point to-night. What we really want is immediate action. I do not think that plans are of any use because this is pressing and should be attended to at once. We were told on a former occasion that in 1906 there were 10,000 fewer foals in the country than there were in 1905. As far as I can see, one of the chief reasons for our shortage of horses is that foreigners come over and buy our horses at three years of age, whereas our War Office do not purchase till the horses are four years of age. The result is that we only get what the foreigners will not take; and I have it on the highest authority that the Austrian, German, and French Cavalry are very much better horsed than we are, and they are mostly mounted on English horses or the descendants of horses bought in this country. This state of affairs is highly unsatisfactory.<lb/>
I am sure it is not the fault of the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture. He is an old Cavalryman and an old brother officer of my own, and I am sure he will do his best to help the Cavalry. The number of horses required for one Division is comparatively small, and I should like to ask your Lordships what would happen if we had a general mobilisation and instead of wanting 7,000 horses we required 150,000, and 300,000 before the end of the first year, and at a moment when probably the Continental market would be closed and we should have great difficulty in getting horses from our Colonies. It seems to me that we must depend on
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0457"/>
<col>907</col>
our home market, and that some steps ought to be taken, and taken at once, to provide against all our best horses being taken out of the country. I do not mean to say that any restriction should be placed on horses going out of the country because that would interfere with the market, but I think our own War Office ought to purchase horses at an earlier age and make some arrangements by which they could be kept in this country until they were ready to be put with the regiments. I hope the noble Lord will be able to give me some satisfaction on this point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02054"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I can best answer the noble Earl's Question by telling your Lordships quite shortly what the object of last week's operations at Aldershot was. The experiment that was being tried was that of bringing a Division up to its absolute war strength. I do not like to call it mobilisation. This was not mobilisation technically speaking, though the result was for our purpose the same. We desired to bring this Division up to war strength in order to test certain tactical problems. We wanted to see, for instance, how much space they would occupy on the roads, how much space they would occupy in bivouac, and there were certain problems as to the feeding of the men&#x2014;all technical problems which did not require extended operations to give us what we wanted. In fact, the whole of the operations of this Division lasted only forty-eight hours. In military operations the theory of your Supply Park is that it moves one day's march behind your Division&#x2014;that is to say, that in last week's operations supposing you had horsed your Supply Park it would not have left Aldershot. In fact, the Ammunition Park which we did horse did not move out of Aldershot at all. Therefore, there was nothing to be gained and no lesson to be learned by horsing the Supply Park, and to have done it would have involved a considerable sum of money. We did not consider the expenditure of this money justified because no useful results could possibly have accrued from it, and that was the reason we did not horse the Transport and Supply Park. Although we call it Divisional Transport, it is more fair to look upon the Transport and Supply Park as part of the lines of communication, which you could only have really made use of if the whole thing had been on a very
<col>908</col>
much larger scale than it was. There was no question at all of any shortage of horses due to the fact that a large number of Territorials were out for training or to any other reason whatever. I think we should have found it perfectly easy to obtain the necessary horses had they been required. As to the general question of the supply of horses, I would ask your Lordships to remember that, after all, the number of horses available for training purposes and the number of horses that would be available in the event of mobilisation and of the Government taking the powers which the Army Act confers upon them are two entirely different things. Until the census of horses which is now being taken throughout the country is completed it will be impossible to know the number of horses available, but from what we do know we are perfectly certain that there is a number sufficient not only for the First and Second Line in case of mobilisation, but to leave a large surplus over and above our immediate requirements on mobilisation. The future supply of horses affects my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture more than myself, and I will leave to him any further answer that can be made.</membercontribution></p>

This Bill will provide a fund for agricultural schemes such as my proposals with reference to horse breeding for Army purposes, which have been approved of by the War Office and the Army Council, and which I am confident will permanently insure a sufficient supply of horses being immediately available for military purposes besides giving a great impetus to the breeding of the right class of horses by the farmers of the United Kingdom. I hope this answer will be satisfactory to the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02060"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: With the permission of the House I should like to say a single word. This is the third consecutive unsatisfactory answer which His Majesty's Government have made to this Question. I wish to remind the noble Earl that this is the fourth time I have put this Question, and what answer have I received? Why, no answer at all. The noble Earl cannot tell us what His Majesty's Government propose to do. Well, if His Majesty's Government cannot tell us what they propose to do with regard to a contribution towards the cost of this extremely important and expensive scheme, then at all events they cannot in decency ask this House to pass the Bill until they are prepared to give us this information. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland is not here to-night, and I understand from Lord Carrington that he will be here tomorrow. I therefore give notice that I shall ask the noble Lord to-morrow whether, in these circumstances, seeing that His Majesty's Government cannot give any information at all with regard to this matter, he will postpone the Third Reading of the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02086"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he desired to raise a point of some importance in connection with Clause 3. That clause ran&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as imposing any obligation on a parent to submit his child to medical inspection or treatment under section thirteen of the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907."</quote>
This Bill dealt, not with medical inspection, but with medical treatment. He could easily understand it if the clause merely said that while under the Bill parents could be made to pay for the medical treatment of their children, no obligation should be imposed upon them to submit their children to medical treatment; but this clause seemed to strike at the root of the Act of 1907, which required parents to have their children inspected, by leaving it optional with parents whether or not they should submit their children for inspection. Although this appeared in a supplementary Bill it would be a notice to all parents, a great many of whom did not like their children being medically inspected, that they were not obliged to have them inspected. He understood that this clause was inserted in the Bill in the other House at the instigation of the Government, and he would like to ask whether it was intended that this should be a notice that for the future a parent could refuse to have his child medically inspected. That certainly appeared to be the case, and it went outside the scope of the Bill because the remainder of the Bill dealt purely with medical treatment. There was no doubt whatever that local authorities were bound to have children medically inspected. He was told that there was some doubt in the wording of the Act whether, if a parent refused, he could be compelled to have his child medically inspected, but at all events if this clause passed there would be no doubt about it for the future. Parents would know that they need not submit their children to medical inspection, and he had no doubt that a large number of parents, particularly the parents of those children who most required medical inspection, would refuse to allow their children to be medically inspected. He wished to ask the Government whether that was the intention of the clause.</p>

of caution lest it should be supposed that this Bill placed upon parents any compulsion which was not placed upon them by the Act of 1907. It is, therefore, purely precautionary. I am inclined to agree with the noble Lord that in its form it is somewhat alarming, and, speaking without prejudice and subject to inquiries which I may make, I should have thought that its form might have been improved by saying that&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as imposing an obligation further than is provided under Section 13 of the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907,"</quote>
or some words to that effect, in order to make it clear that the law is left as it is and that if compulsion exists it exists still, and that if it does not exist matters are left where they are.

<title>TUBERCULOUS CATTLE IN SCOTLAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02095"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary for Scotland whether any inquiry has been made, or any estimate formed, as to the number of tuberculous cattle in Scotland; and, if so, whether he will state the information to the House; whether he can give any estimate&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) as to the probable cost which will be incurred by the slaughter of tuberculous cattle in Scotland; (<i>b</i>) as to the total amount of compensation payable in respect thereof; and (<i>c</i>) over how many financial years it is estimated that such cost will be spread.<lb/>
In regard to the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Bill these questions are of considerable importance, and before the Secretary for Scotland introduced that Bill into your Lordships' House it is probable that he had some estimate made which would show the probable number of cattle that would be dealt with under the Bill and also the cost which would be likely to be incurred in the way of compensation for animals slaughtered. I would like to point out that the population in the towns would benefit more than anybody else under the Bill, and that the agricultural population would be those who would be penalised. It is of importance that we should have some indication of the probable cost and the probable number of animals that would be condemned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02096"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord knows, this is really not a matter which lies within the province of the Scottish Office, and my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, who would have answered this Question had it been possible for him to be present to-day, greatly regrets that he is not able to be here. Everybody, of course, will recognise the force of the arguments which the noble Lord has used as to this being, at any rate in some degree, a general charge rather than a special local charge; but I may remind him that what has been introduced both for England and Scotland in the shape of milk and dairies legislation would be perfectly practicable without the Tuberculosis Order on which the scheme of compensation to which the noble Lord has referred hangs. It is true, of course, that the Tuberculosis Order is complementary to the two Bills, but at the same time the two Bills might
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0461"/>
<col>915</col>
be passed into law and become operative without raising the questions dealt with by the Tuberculosis Order. In those circumstances I regret to say I have no definite information to give. This has not been a scheduled disease before. Therefore there are no reliable statistics on the question, and we really have no reliable <i>data</i> upon which to found any deductions whatever. But my noble friend is at the present moment engaged in endeavouring to form some estimate of the number of tuberculous cattle which would fall to be dealt with under this Order, and if the noble Lord will be good enough to postpone his Question till a further date my noble friend will do what is possible then to give the information asked for.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02097"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one suggestion I should like to make. The noble Lord says it is not within his Department, and that the legislation proposed could go on without bringing into force the Tuberculosis Order. Might I venture to suggest that there is some danger in pressing legislation for one country much in advance of another country when the two countries are so close together as England and Scotland. I do not want to give my fellow-countrymen a bad reputation and I will put it quite tentatively, but supposing there are much more stringent regulations in one country than in the other it is just possible that the inhabitants of that country might convey their cattle over the Border rather than have them slaughtered, and it seems to me of extreme importance, from a public point of view, that the legislation for the two countries should be kept as nearly on the same lines as possible and should go forward together about the same time. I am practically certain that, whichever country is dealt with first, there will be difficulties in enforcing the law without the danger which I have indicated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02098"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: I should like to support the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord Balfour. Strangely enough the provisions of the English Bill, of the passing of which there is no chance, or only a very remote chance, this session, are very different in many respects from those of the Scottish Bill, and I think it would be convenient if we could see both Bills in your Lordships' House at the same time and be able to judge whether some of the
<col>916</col>
provisions in the Scottish Bill might not be more suitable for the English Bill than the provisions as at present drafted. I think the suggestion with regard to what may happen if a Bill is passed for one side of the Border and not for the other is one which certainly should be very carefully considered by those who will be responsible for this measure. The Tuberculosis Circular speaks about the very serious burden that is going to be placed upon local authorities if, as is at present proposed, the amount of compensation is to be found out of the rates, and not out of Imperial funds. I hope that, considering the very great doubt which exists as to what the cost is going to be and the fact that there is a very strong feeling that some part of this charge should be placed on Imperial funds, the noble Lord will think it right to postpone the Bill till some further date when we can have an assurance on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02099"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may be allowed to point out that what creates the difficulty anticipated by noble Lords opposite is not the fact of this proposed legislation. It is not the fact of one Bill being passed in one country before the Bill for the other country comes into force so much as the bringing into operation of the Order in one country earlier than in the other. The passing of the Bill is really not a crucial point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02100"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: We had an assurance that the Milk Bill would run with the Tuberculosis Order.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MILK AND DAIRIES (SCOTLAND) BILL.<lb/> [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02101"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary for Scotland to postpone the Motion for the Third Reading of the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Bill. Your Lordships will recollect that on three or four occasions I have asked His Majesty's Government what contribution they proposed to make, if any, towards the cost of the Bill. When I first asked the question and was requested to withdraw it, I did so on the understanding that there would be a reasonable amount of delay after I received my answer before the Third Reading was taken. I received an answer only yesterday, and the Third Reading of the Bill is down for to-morrow.<lb/>
But without going into the question how
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0462"/>
<col>917</col>
far that delay is reasonable or not, I wish to say that the Government have evidently not decided as to how these funds are to be provided. I do not find any fault with them on that head. The cost will be very considerable indeed, and I think that the Government may be excused for not being able to give a definite answer at this moment. One thing is certain, that whatever the Government intend to do with regard to Scotland they will also have to do with regard to England and Ireland. Therefore the question is one which does not concern Scotland alone. All we know at present is that the Government have not decided what they are prepared to do with regard to Scotland. The question which has just been asked by Lord Saltoun furnishes another reason why the Third Reading of this Bill should he delayed. It is quite clear that there are no reliable statistics; indeed, if I gathered the noble Lord's answer correctly, no statistics at all. The words he used were that there were no "reliable statistics," but I put it to him whether he is aware of any statistics of any kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02102"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to be understood as debarring my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture, with the means at his disposal, from forming what he may choose to consider an estimate of the possibilities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02103"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: In that case is it not rather a pity that that estimate, formed by whatever means, is not given to us? All we know is that the President of the Board of Agriculture is not able to be present to-day, and the noble Lord, who, I presume, has obtained from him all such information as he possesses, tells us that he is not aware of any statistics. Those two reasons alone seem to me quite sufficient to justify me in asking that the Third Reading of this Bill should be postponed. The cost of the Bill, as I have stated more than once, is going to be very great indeed. The other day I mentioned the figure which had been given by an eminent doctor, who said he believed there were 200,000 tuberculous cattle in the country&#x2014;I presume that is the whole country. The noble Earl the Leader of the House thought that estimate rather high, and seemed to think I was inclined to take an exaggerated view of the magnitude of the question. I do not think so. I would remind the House that there has been quite recently almost a war between the butchers and farmers over this
<col>918</col>
question of tuberculosis. These two important trades are inter-dependent one upon the other, and as there has very nearly been a war between them I think Parliament may be quite certain that there is a very considerable amount of tuberculosis. That there is a large amount of tuberculosis in the country is borne out by the admission of the President of the Board of Agriculture that the cost of enforcing this Order would be very great. That being so, and the Government having been unable to arrive at any decision in regard to the financial provisions, would it be prudent on the part of this House to part with the Bill at the present time? As has been said, this is not the only Bill before Parliament dealing with milk and tuberculosis. There is a Bill for England and Ireland. Why those two countries should be placed together and Scotland dealt with by itself is a mystery to me. And, indeed, speaking of Scottish legislation generally, I find it rather difficult to understand at times the exact method of procedure and the rules which guide His Majesty's Government in determining whether Scotland is to be dealt with by itself or in regard to England. I will give an instance. Your Lordships may remember that in the year 1907 when the Agricultural Holdings Act was before Parliament the Government insisted on dealing with England and Scotland together. There certainly were reasons, and they were urged from this side of the House, why it was more desirable on the whole that there should be two Bills, the tenure in England being yearly and that in Scotland, as your Lordships know, being mainly tenure by lease. But the Government then insisted on having one Bill for both countries. Well, bad milk and tuberculosis are very much the same thing whether in England, Scotland, or Ireland, and tuberculous cattle, I fancy, are very much of the same quality. Therefore surely it is desirable that, as far as possible, these two questions which affect the whole nation should be dealt with by one Bill and by regulations as nearly as possible identical. My noble friend Lord Balfour has already alluded to this very great difficulty, that if you pass the Scottish Bill and it comes into force on January 1 next, and if the Order also comes into force on that date and the Bill for England and Ireland is not passed, then Scotland alone will be under these stringent regulations. What would be the result? Tuberculous cattle would come to England. Surely it is inexpedient that Scotland alone should be under these stringent regulations.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0463"/>
<col>919</col>
We have no notion whatever as to what the cost is going to be, and as the Government have in no way made up their minds as to how the cost should be met I hope the noble Lord will see that it would really be hardly reasonable to ask us to read the Bill a Third Time to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02104"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would suggest that the whole question of tuberculosis should be taken up in the immediate future by His Majesty's Government, both on account of this milk legislation and also on account of the trouble there has been between the butchers and the farmers. Undoubtedly farmers suffer considerable hardships in having their meat inspected in the absence of any system of standardised inspection while meat with the infectious parts cut out is allowed to come in from abroad. Although no statistics can be produced as to the number of cattle which would have to be killed if the Tuberculosis Order were put in force, it is clear that there are in the United Kingdom a large number of animals suffering from tuberculosis, and in cases where cattle have been tested it has been found that only five out of thirty-five were able to pass the test. I put these facts forward simply to show that this is a very important question and one which ought to be faced, not simply with regard to the milk side, but with regard also to the meat side and the unfairness under which farmers at present labour in competing with importers of foreign meat.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02105"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I earnestly hope that the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland will give serious consideration to what has been said and postpone the Third Reading of the Bill. The answer he has given to my Question to-night has furnished an additional reason for doing so. I think it is only right that we should hear from the Minister for Agriculture what the probable expenditure will be, and also the probable number of cattle that would have to be destroyed. I am greatly surprised that the Secretary for Scotland did not get some statistics or some information from the Board of Agriculture which he could have given to the House. I should have thought he would have done so before introducing the Bill. It is a dangerous thing to put this immense burden on the rates without having some idea of what is being done. I therefore hope the noble Lord will consent to postpone the Third Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02106"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will
<col>920</col>
your Lordships allow me to repeat that not a single cow is to be slaughtered under this Bill? Therefore there is not a provision for a single shilling of compensation for slaughter either in this Bill or in the English Bill. The Government quite recognise that the question of compensation, which is complementary to any further legislation relating to milk and dairies for either country, is a material part of this question, and that no new legislation will be fully effective without dealing with the matter. But, at the same time, we recognise that the question of compensation is a general question, and should be dealt with generally for the United Kingdom. Therefore it is proposed to deal with it by the Tuberculosis Order and not by Bills. The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, has taken serious objection to our having a separate Bill for Scotland on this subject. In following that course we are simply acting on precedent. Separate legislation has been passed for Scotland on this question hitherto. There is every desire on the part of the Government to synchronise, so far as is practicable, the passing into law of the two Bills. The question of meat is not touched by this Bill. But so far as milk and dairies are concerned great trouble has been taken to make this a Bill which will have the support, co-operation, and goodwill of those who will administer it in Scotland; and considering all the pains that have been taken to make this a workable measure, to consult the wishes, the predilections, the habits and customs, and, if you like, the prejudices, of local authorities in Scotland, and the interest that has been aroused in the measure there, I appeal to your Lordships, on behalf of the Government, to allow the Bill to proceed. I may add that I have given an assurance on the part of the Government that they have no intention of placing any one part of the United Kingdom at a disadvantage as compared with any other part.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02107"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Lord agree to postpone the Third Reading of the Bill? That is the question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02108"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The Government are, of course, in a matter of this kind in your Lordships' hands. If it is desirable as a matter of convenience that the Third Reading should be postponed I have no control over that; but my noble friend the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0464"/>
<col>921</col>
President of the Board of Agriculture agrees with me that it is desirable that we should proceed as far as we can in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02109"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I hope, in spite of the statement he has just made, that the Secretary for Scotland will consider whether it would not be for the general convenience of the House that this Bill should not be proceeded with tomorrow. What is the situation? We have it from the noble Lord that there are statistics in process of collection but not yet available. Not only are there no statistics available, but His Majesty's Government have apparently not yet been able to consider a very important question of policy&#x2014;I mean the question of the source from which the expense that will undoubtedly be incurred under this Bill is to be provided. The noble Lord said that the Bill itself does not necessitate any expenditure at all, but surely it is the case that the orders which will be issued under the Bill will involve a very large expenditure of money. The noble Lord, in the course of his answer to my noble friend Lord Saltoun, let fall this observation. He said that it would appear at first sight that compensation of this sort should be a general rather than a special and local charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02110"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Dealt with by general order&#x2014;therefore by the Tuberculosis Order of the Board of Agriculture, which has administration over both countries, rather than by the Scottish Office, which has only administration over one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02111"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: If I misunderstood the noble Lord I will pay no further attention to that point. But the fact remains that we have not had a single hint, although my noble friend Lord Camperdown has repeated his question again and again, as to the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to this question of compensation. Is it the case that the postponement of the Third Reading would occasion any real inconvenience? I should have thought it was all the other way. You have another Bill before Parliament dealing with the question of tuberculous disease in other parts of the United Kingdom, and surely my noble friends are justified in saying that it would be much fairer that this question should be dealt with, not with reference to one part of the
<col>922</col>
United Kingdom at one time and another part at another time, but should be dealt with as a whole, because, after all, tuberculous disease is tuberculous disease whether it is to be found on the north or on the south of the Border, and I cannot conceive that it should be desirable to deal with it on different lines according to the geographical area in which the disease is found. If the noble Lord adheres to his answer my noble friend and those who are acting with him will, no doubt, consider whether they will give facilities for the further progress of the Bill to-morrow evening, but I should really have thought that the matter was one which might, so far as to-morrow evening, at any rate, is concerned, be dealt with by amicable arrangement between the two sides of the House, and that we should have been given a little more time in which to consider the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02112"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I understand that the notice of this Question appeared only to-day on the Paper, and&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02113"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: It was not possible to put it on the Paper earlier than to-day as I only received my answer&#x2014;it was really no answer&#x2014;yesterday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02114"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: At any rate, the result is that my noble friend has not, perhaps, had full time to consider the question. What occurs to me is this, that if, as the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition has said, statistics are missing which ought to be available and further information is required, I cannot understand why your Lordships have proceeded thus far with the Bill. If a great part of the necessary information was missing, what was the object of going to all the trouble of discussing the Bill in Committee?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02115"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I have at every stage pointed out that the Bill must necessarily depend upon how the cost was to be provided. I have asked the question several times because I regarded it, and I have said over and over again that I regarded it, as essential.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02116"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am extremely anxious not to misrepresent my noble friend opposite in any way, but it does seem to me that in the circumstances

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02117"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to again interrupt the noble Earl, but he does unconsciously misrepresent me. I put the question on the Report Stage and was asked to withdraw it. I then said that I withdrew it on the understanding that I should repeat it before the Third Reading, and that I should have sufficient time after I received the answer to consider what course I would take before the Third Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02118"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is perfectly accurate, and I have not the faintest complaint to make of his action; but what I do not exactly understand is what is meant by postponement. Is the demand that the Bills for England and Scotland should be taken <i>pari passu?</i> I can see some force in the noble Earl's contention that a distinct lapse of time between the coming into operation of the separate measures might be unfortunate, and there I am in general agreement with
<col>924</col>
the noble Earl. But why the discussion of the two measures should necessarily be taken at the same time I confess I do not entirely understand. As my noble friend pointed out, it has always been the custom for these public health matters to be dealt with in separate measures for England and Scotland, and although there may be particular circumstances here which make it inadvisable that different regulations should be in operation at the same time, I cannot see that, as far as the discussion is concerned, it very much matters which is taken first, or whether they are taken at considerable intervals. At any rate we will not press the point.</membercontribution></p>

On that day also there would be a Commission for the Royal Assent to those and to one or two other Bills. We should then propose, unless anything occurs in the meanwhile to cause us to alter our intentions, to adjourn till the 30th of August, and on that date, or the following day, if that should be more convenient to the House, to go on with the Trade Boards Bill and one or two minor Bills. It is expected that the Irish Land Bill will arrive here in the week beginning on August 30, and therefore it will be possible to take that Bill, if desired, in the second week of September, or, of course, if it suited noble Lords better, it could be postponed for a few days, but as regards the time of its arrival that is what is expected.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02136" align="center"><b>[SECOND READING.]</b></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02137">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02138"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to submit for Second Reading the Water Supplies Protection Bill. It is an important measure in many of its aspects, as it deals with a first necessity of life to man and beast and all that grows upon the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0467"/>
<col>927</col>
ground. Notwithstanding that, I do not think that any of the clauses in the Bill are of a novel character. They all have some precedent, having received the sanction of Parliament in one form or another. I do not think it necessary to go into this matter at any length, but I may say that the hardship which it is sought to obviate by this Bill is one of long standing.<lb/>
The law recognises no right of property in water below the soil, and the consequence has been that supposing A had a well on his property and B sank a well on his adjoining property to a deeper depth he might deprive A of water. But no very great harm was done in such a case, as it was possible to come to some arrangement in this matter. The case is different, however, when there appears upon the scene a company with large capital and great pumping powers which proceeds on the principle that if it has land in which to sink pumps it can with impunity take all the water from its neighbours without any compensation whatever. That, I believe, is the present state of the law. It was considered at one time that a water company could not actually deprive a stream of its water by pumping from the chalk at its head, but I believe it was decided, in the case of English <i>v</i>. the Metropolitan Water Board in 1897, before the Lord Chief Justice, that this could be done with impunity. Therefore the present position is practically as I have stated&#x2014;namely, that these water companies who do a great public service can also do a great public disservice by drying up and sapping the land of its moisture without giving compensation to those who suffer in consequence.<lb/>
This Bill has received the serious consideration of the County Council of Hertfordshire, who were largely responsible for its drafting, and it is introduced by me on behalf of the Central Chamber of Agriculture, who are unanimous as to the harm that is being done in this direction. Enormous sums of money have been spent by various corporations and individuals who are rich enough to do so in approaching Parliament and protecting their water supply. The object of this Bill is to protect those who are unable to incur this great expenditure. It is unnecessary for me to refer to the various fights that have taken place in connection with the protection of the water supply. In 1893 a Royal Com-
<col>928</col>
mission was appointed to inquire into the subject. In 1896 the New River Water Company introduced a Bill; numerous petitions were presented against it, and the Bill was ultimately withdrawn. There were also very costly fights in Parliament in connection with the South Essex Water Bills of 1899 and 1900. I could quote a number of other instances. It is no exaggeration to say that the same state of things has been going on all over the country.<lb/>
Parliament has recognised the right of the community to protection against the powers that water companies assume in consequence of there being no legal right in the water below the soil. In 1901 the Wolverhampton Water Bill was rejected on Second Reading largely for the reasons of the hardship which would take place if the Bill was passed into law, and in 1904 I myself opposed the Rickmansworth Water Bill, which was thrown out on Second Reading. Parliament, therefore, gave protection in those cases. There are numerous instances of protection having been given to those who had the money to apply for it, and in 1907 the Lord Chairman, in consequence of the action of Parliamentary committees and of representations from the Board of Trade, introduced a clause in the case of all water companies having Bills then in Parliament prohibiting them from using lands for the purpose of sinking wells except under the express authority of Parliament. It is sought in this Bill to extend this right of protection to all.<lb/>
There are three main provisions in the Bill. The first provision is practically the Lord Chairman's clause which is now inserted in all Bills before Parliament. It provides that no water undertakers shall sink wells or construct works for obtaining their supply unless such wells and works and the sites thereof have been expressly approved by Parliament. The next provision is to amend the law with regard to underground water by providing that wherever private supplies are injured by the abstraction of water for public supply (by means of future works) the owner shall be entitled to compensation. There are various precedents for this principle as well as for the former principle. It was admitted in 1898 and in 1906, and again this year in another case the principle of compensation was admitted and inserted
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0468"/>
<col>929</col>
in Bills very much in the manner in which it appears here. The third provision in the Bill is to provide that where, by means of future works, water is taken from any district for supply to communities outside that district, the district whence the water is taken and through which it is conveyed shall be entitled to demand a share of such water for its own needs upon terms to be agreed or fixed by the Local Government Board. This principle has been recognised in the Manchester case and also in the Metropolitan Acts of 1902. These are the three main objects of the Bill, all of which, as I have said, have precedents for them.<lb/>
I will now briefly go through the provisions of the Bill. Clause 2 provides that the Bill shall not extend to Scotland or Ireland, but if Scotland or Ireland desire to have it extended to them I do not anticipate any difficulty in that being done. Clause 3 is practically the Lord Chairman's clause which is now inserted in all Water Bills before your Lordships' House. Clause 4 provides compensation for injury by abstraction of water. This clause closely follows the precedent set in the South Staffordshire Bill of this year. It provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"if any private water supply situate within any protected area&#x2026;shall be diminished or injured subsequently to the construction or enlargement after the passing of this Act&#x2014;</quote>
these words are important as showing that it is not proposed that the Bill should be in any way retrospective&#x2014;
<quote>"of any works of an authorised undertaker, that authorised undertaker shall (in default of proof that such diminution or injury has not been caused by such works) make full compensation."</quote>
This also follows the precedent of the South Staffordshire Bill. The reason the water company is required to prove that it has not injured the well is, as will be apparent to your Lordships, that many poor people cannot afford to go to the expense of getting expert witnesses and fighting Bills in Parliament in order to obtain protection. Supposing new works of an important character are carried out by a water company and a neighbouring well suddenly goes dry, the object of this clause is that the water company, who possess experts and the necessary machinery for doing so, should prove that the sudden drying up was not due to them or to anything under their control.<lb/>
<col>930</col>
Subsection (2) of Clause 4 provides that for the purposes of this section authorised undertakers shall have power to supply water outside their limits of supply and to execute and do all such works and things as may be necessary. The object of this is to meet the case of a man who has a well just outside the area of supply of the pumping company and which has been dried up as a result of the operations of the company. The subsection will enable the company to supply water in that particular case. Clause 5 sanctions the right of supply in bulk from water in transit. This principle has already been recognised in the Manchester case and in various other cases, but there is a protection in this case given to the water undertakers because there is an appeal by both parties to the Local Government Board, and the Board are given power of determining whether in their opinion the demand to be supplied with water in transit is equitable and the terms and conditions under which it should be done. The safeguard in that clause is the inquiry to be held by the Local Government Board at which all parties shall be entitled to be heard. I have now explained to your Lordships the chief points of the Bill, and I beg to move that it be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02139">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;(<i>Lord Desborough</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02140"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Local Government Board fully recognise the importance of the questions dealt with in this Bill. They recognise, too, that in a great many localities there has been a considerable diminution in the water supply through the operations of large water undertakings which supply populous districts, but at the same time it must be recognised that a cheap and plentiful supply of water is a prime necessity for all populous districts. Care must, therefore, be taken not to impose any great restrictions upon these large water undertakings.<lb/>
If your Lordships will allow me, I will take the various objects of the Bill and state the view of the Local Government Board upon each. The first object is to prohibit the sinking of any well or the construction of any water works for taking or intercepting water by any authorised undertaker unless those works and the lands upon which they are to be constructed are specified in an Act of Parliament.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0469"/>
<col>931</col>
That provision is in Clause 3. If your Lordships will look at Clause 7 you will find that the expression "authorised undertaker" means any local authority, company, body, or persons authorised by Act of Parliament or Provisional Order confirmed by Act of Parliament to take water for purposes of distribution and supply. Under the Public Health Act, 1875, urban and rural district councils are empowered and may in certain cases be compelled to provide a supply of water for their neighbouring villages; but under this Bill no works could be constructed, even though all parties were agreed as to the necessity of doing so, without coming to Parliament. The obtaining of an Act of Parliament, even if it is not opposed, is a lengthy proceeding, and is a matter which involves considerable expense. It would, appear almost unreasonable to ask a rural district council to incur such an expense; and, further, it should be mentioned that at present rural district councils have no statutory authority to promote Bills in Parliament, and the Local Government Board do not consider that it would be advisable to give it to them.<lb/>
As regards the compensation to be paid for diminution of or injury to private water supplies, the expression "private water supply" is defined in Clause 7 as including rivers, springs, streams, ditches, ponds, wells, and bore pipes, and the water flowing or a percolating into or being therein and owned or used by any person not being an authorised undertaker. It would appear that it would expose authorised under-takers to very serious liability if every pond and ditch were included in that category, and unless they could prove that they were not responsible for the injury, they would, I take it, have to pay full compensation. It is an extremely difficult thing to prove a negative, and this provision would place undertakers in a most unfortunate position. Again, the radius of two and a-half miles seems rather a hard and fast provision. In some cases the effect of water works extends further than that distance, and in others perhaps less.<lb/>
The next proposal is open, I think, to a somewhat similar objection. While it is quite reasonable that if a big undertaking is conveying water from a distance opportunity might be taken to provide a supply where it is needed along the route, still if it is laid down as a hard and fast rule

At the same time it seems to him that this Bill is too general in its proposals. He is afraid that it would substitute other grievances scarcely less serious than those it desires to remedy. Any general provisions to prevent the absorption of smaller supplies by larger undertakings ought to be very carefully safeguarded. In regard to fresh schemes coming before Parliament, I understand that it is now the practice of Parliamentary, Committees to consider most closely the details of all such schemes and their probable effect on local supplies and to insert appropriate provisions to safeguard them. It appears to the President of the Local Government Board that such provisions framed to meet the particular circumstances of special cases would be likely to be more satisfactory and equitable than the general and hard and fast rule provided in this Bill. For these reasons the Local Government Board do not favour the Second Reading of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02145"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess I have heard with great disappointment the views expressed by the noble Earl on behalf of His Majesty's Government. There is no doubt as to the grievance which this Bill is intended to meet. My noble friend who introduced it laid great stress, and very properly, on the unfortunate case of the poor man, the owner, perhaps, of a small piece of land containing a well, who has his well entirely drained by some authority or company which has obtained powers
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0470"/>
<col>933</col>
to sink a deep well for the benefit of some populous area. It is a great and general grievance in the rural parts of the country. Though the Bill may be capable of amendment in regard to details, I venture to differ from the concluding words of the noble Earl when he said, on behalf of the President of the Local Government Board, that he thought no general alteration of the law was necessary in this matter. I do think that a general alteration of the law is necessary on behalf of those poorer persons whom my noble friend wishes to protect.<lb/>
Now what were the objections raised by the noble Earl opposite? In the first place, he said that if Clause 3 were passed in its present form a parish council or rural district council would be unable to sink a well in their district to supply water to the inhabitants of that district. If that is so, that is a point of detail in which, no doubt, the Bill might be capable of amendment; but that is not a ground for objecting to the Second Reacting of the Bill. Then, again, the noble Earl objected to the obligation which the Bill proposes to impose on companies or local authorities by requiring them to prove that they have not abstracted the water from the well of a private owner. It may be difficult to prove a negative, but I do think there is some reason for strengthening the law in this matter. If it is difficult to prove a negative, it is by no means easy to prove an affirmative. Then the noble Earl objected to the third provision of the Bill, which he thought would impose very great difficulties in the way of local authorities in supplying water. That, again, is a matter for consideration in Committee. What I would venture to suggest is this, that the principle of the Bill might very fairly be affirmed by your Lordships' House, and that then the Bill might be referred, if His Majesty's Government thought well, to a Select Committee for further inquiry. We might then hope that my noble friend who introduced this Bill would see some practical result from his labours.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02146"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I share the surprise which was expressed by the noble Viscount at the attitude His Majesty's Government have adopted towards this Bill. As my noble friend Lord Desborough showed, there is really no proposal in the Bill which has not already
<col>934</col>
received the sanction of Parliament. Clause 3, commonly known as the Wells Clause, is the clause which is now inserted in every Bill dealing with this matter which comes before Parliament, and it has the effect of preventing any local authority or private promoters from taking water from any places or by any works except those which have been sanctioned by Parliament.<lb/>
But it is not every local authority and every water company that come to Parliament, and unless they do come to Parliament they still have the power, so far as Parliament is concerned, to sink wells on any land which they may possess or which they may by agreement acquire. I will not enter into the question as to whether or not the Courts of Law would hold that they had such a power. I think there has been a recent decision which rather tends to show that the law as it stands certainly discourages the idea that water companies or local authorities may sink wells wherever they choose within their district without coming to Parliament.<lb/>
The reason why I am surprised at the attitude of His Majesty's Government is that this matter has already been before the other House of Parliament, and when Water Bills came before that House at the commencement of this session there was an Instruction moved to the Committees by whom those Bills were considered that they should inquire whether adequate provision had been made for the supply of water to any person or persons from whom any existing or natural supply was or might be withdrawn owing to the works or undertakings sanctioned by Parliament. That is practically the Bill of my noble friend, and I should have thought that if the Government were going to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill they would have proposed some alternative, such as the setting up of a Joint Committee to consider what was a proper clause to insert in all Water Bills to protect the poorer classes of the community.<lb/>
I do not mean to say that I agree with every part of every clause in this Bill. The question of the <i>onus probandi</i> is a very important and a very serious one. It is one which has been settled by different Parliamentary Committees in different ways. Sometimes the <i>onus probandi</i> has been put upon the promoters, and some-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0471"/>
<col>935</col>
times upon the complainant. The South Staffordshire Bill, to which Lord Desborough referred, had a proviso which to my mind is more equitable than the one in this Bill, because it gave both parties an opportunity of taking objection. That Bill provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"It shall not be obligatory on the owner to show that such diminution has been caused by the pumping aforesaid, but on the other hand it shall be competent to the company to show that any diminution has not been caused by such pumping."</quote>
Therefore both parties were able to appear and state their case, and the <i>onus probandi</i> was equally distributed. I hope your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading and allow the House a further opportunity of considering its details. There are, of course, large undertakings, such as the supply to Glasgow and Birmingham, where no great hardship would ensue if the pipes were tapped on the way from the source of supply to the consumers; but there are smaller undertakings which would not be able to supply in this way. These, however, are all questions of detail. The matter is one of very great importance, as the supply of water is not inexhaustible. In fact, in many parts of the country this is becoming a serious subject for consideration, and I venture to submit that it is the duty of Parliament, as far as it can, to protect the sources of supply to everyone who is entitled to draw from them, and not allow them to be exhausted on behalf of one section only of the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02147"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to say a few words on this Bill as I live in a county which is, perhaps, likely to suffer more than any other from the system which at present prevails. Reference has been made to the power of water companies to put down pumping stations without coming to Parliament. Our early experience was a very good instance of that. The Corporation of Nottingham applied to borrow money for the purpose of putting down a new pumping station on land which they had acquired by private purchase. Fortunately we had a <i>locus standi</i>, because their pipes were going to cross our road. If that had not been so the county council could not have stepped in, and there were no other minor authorities in the county sufficiently strong to make a protest against this scheme. The result of the inquiry was that the Local Government Board declared the matter to be of such importance
<col>936</col>
that it must come to Parliament. The Bill came to Parliament; we opposed it very strongly in the other House, and finally the Bill was thrown out; but they were given a pumping station to be placed in the north of the county where there was an ample supply of water, and which we had offered them at the very outset of the proceedings. That showed the necessity of some body being empowered to look after the water supply of the rural districts.<lb/>
In our county the water supply is an underground water supply, and undoubtedly you may, by putting down more powerful machinery than your neighbours, dry not only all the wells and streams in the neighbourhood, but also the less important pumping stations of the minor authorities. The common law right of pumping water on your own land, valuable and necessary as it is to those people who live upon their own property, was not a right which had been intended to be disposed of by private treaty to a large corporation who could put down a powerful pumping station and practically pump the neighbourhood dry. I think we should be grateful to the noble Lord for introducing this Bill, which makes a serious attempt to deal with this difficulty.<lb/>
This matter is not a new one. Seven years ago the County Councils Association appointed a very important committee, which was joined in by one society of engineers and by other bodies, to inquire into the whole question of underground water, and a valuable memorandum was produced. The result was that a deputation waited upon Mr. Walter Long, who was then President of the Local Government Board, to press upon him the necessity for some inquiry which would lead to legislation on this matter. The County Councils Association themselves promoted a Bill to try and establish a local authority who should have a general discretion over the watersheds. The West Riding and Lancashire succeeded in getting private Bills on those lines for themselves and our feeling was that if a general Act could be passed setting up some water authority, including no doubt representatives of the authorities in the county, who should have discretion with regard to the sinking of wells looking at what the supply of the district was it would be very valuable. Mr. Walter Long entirely agreed, and I think at that time he was anxious to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0472"/>
<col>937</col>
appoint a Commission. That Commission, however, never was appointed.<lb/>
Another subject of the greatest importance is the allowing of water to run to waste. Clause 4 deals with the question of the payment of compensation where water disappears owing to a new pumping station having been put down; but in a district like that in which I live it would be absolutely impossible to prove what was the cause of a sinking of water in particular wells. I will state what happened in our own case. A colliery was being sunk and during that work wells miles away were absolutely run dry in consequence, it was supposed, of the millions of gallons of water which ran to waste while the colliery was being sunk. There is also no doubt that at that period there had been very dry seasons, and the underground reservoirs had less water in them than before. The pumping stations had a great effect in reducing the amount of water available in the wells, but since then there have been rainy seasons, and a certain amount of water has returned. Therefore, it would be impossible to judge in these cases whether the decrease in the water available was owing to natural causes or to the particular pumping stations which had been laid down.<lb/>
I should like to ask His Majesty's Government to consider the desirability of undertaking some sort of inquiry, either by a Committee of both Houses or a Royal Commission. Some of the provisions of this Bill are extremely desirable, and it does seem to me that there are many points of importance which a Committee or Commission could inquire into, and if the Bill is read a second time it might be made the foundation of dealing with the particular points in the Bill, but the inquiry could be extended into the whole question of the rights with regard to underground water. I should be obliged in Committee to move Amendments to Clause 4, which I do not think is applicable in its present form to all parts of the country; but I hope the Bill will be read a second time and will form the basis of an inquiry into the whole subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02148"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, anyone who has sat on Committees upstairs has had experience of this difficulty, and I can recall frequent instances in which, much against my inclination, I have given Bills to promoters which manifestly would injure
<col>938</col>
certain localities. My noble friend who has brought in this Bill instanced cases where both protection and compensation have been accorded, but what I desire to point out is that this is a purely haphazard matter. In one case compensation may be awarded, but in another case, equally deserving, no such safeguard is obtained. In fact, it depends entirely on the chance of the membership of the Committee, and in my opinion it is most desirable that the Chairman of Committees should have definite rules by which they can be guided. With regard to this Bill, I venture to suggest to my noble friend that it is not of much use proceeding with the Bill if the Government are unfriendly to it. What possible chance is there of its becoming law? I venture to suggest as an alternative that the Local Government Board should appoint a Departmental Committee to consider the special points that have been raised. It need not take a long time. A decision might be arrived at before next session, when a model clause serving as a future guide to Private Bill Committees might be submitted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02149"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount opposite and the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees expressed acute disappointment at the attitude assumed by the Government in regard to this Bill. I confess that I do not think their attitude was an entirely reasonable one, and for this reason. This Bill contains three separate propositions, all of importance and all most clearly impressed on the House in the opening speech of the noble Lord. Exception has been taken to every one of these propositions, I think I am right in saying, by noble Lords who have spoken opposite, and who yet apparently desire to support the Second Reading.<lb/>
This Bill seems to be an instance of a habit which appears to be growing on the House&#x2014;that is to say, of introducing Bills and recommending them without any real regard to what they actually contain, and asking that they should be read a second time because they suggest a general principle of which everybody may be supposed to be in favour. In that respect this Bill resembles a very different Bill&#x2014;that dealing with compulsory service. We were told then, Pay no attention to the contents of the Bill, this and that is objectionable, but do vote for the Second Reading in order to establish the principle. Now we are
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0473"/>
<col>939</col>
told that there is a grievance, which I fully admit, on this water question, and we are therefore to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill, although all the actual propositions which it contains appear to be disputed.<lb/>
I do not deny the importance of the question raised by the Bill or the existence of a grievance. It is no doubt the fact that very hard cases occur in which, under water schemes, water is abstracted from wells and from the supplies of private persons and of small communities, who gain nothing whatever from the passing of the larger scheme and indeed only lose by it. Those cases in the main, I should have thought, were cases which come before Parliament. I should have thought that the bulk of cases in which real hardship follows are cases in which application has to be made by Bill owing to the scale on which the operations are to be conducted, and then it is, of course, within the power of the Committee upstairs to insert any safeguards it can think of in the Bill. I am disposed to agree with the noble Lord who spoke last that it would be highly advantageous if some uniform method of applying these safeguards in Bills could be arrived at, and this certainly is one of the matters which demand attention.<lb/>
As regards the three points, it seems to me that the noble Lord would have done better if he had not spread his net quite so wide, and if he had not tried to cover in this very general way every conceivable case of hardship. The first proposition is that all schemes by public authorities to supply water must be carried through by Act of Parliament. The noble Viscount said that that is a mere detail which can be considered in Committee. Surely it is a principle. If you are at once going to say that there are a considerable number of schemes, or any number of schemes, which need not come before Parliament, that may be the best way to meet the matter, but the noble Lord's principle goes by the board and you really come to the existing state of things some-what modified. That is one principle of the Bill gone.<lb/>
The second principle is that wherever private supplies are injured by the abstraction of water the owner shall be entitled to compensation. Lord Belper has explained the extreme difficulty of
<col>940</col>
arriving at the facts in a case of that kind. He mentioned the case of colliery sinkings, which in many cases abstract a great deal of water from their neighbourhood and sometimes from a considerable distance. In such cases there is no remedy, and apparently the noble Lord does not intend to apply a remedy. It is only in the case of a public supply that any remedy is to be applied. I ask your Lordships whether you are prepared to accept the proposition that in every case where a well is affected within a district of two and a half miles, whatever may be the possible contributory causes, the unhappy local authority is to be compelled to prove that it has not caused the loss of water. If that is the proposition which you are proposing to accept, and which you would accept, I think, by reading the Bill a second time, then it would put an absolute stoppage on all small local water schemes, and recourse to filling the kettle at the wayside ditch, which still exists in parts of the country, will continue to exist where small water schemes might otherwise be carried out. I do not think that with this risk over them any rural district council would attempt to engage in any kind of water scheme at all.<lb/>
Then you have the third proposition, that the company is obliged to supply the whole of any district, whether rural or urban, through which the mains may pass on their way from the source of supply to the inhabitants of the district. There, again, we are told that that is a mere detail, and that there may be cases where it ought not to be done. But surely that is a principle. The moment you break into that you return very much to the existing state of things, in which, as we know, provision is frequently made both for supplying district councils or individuals through whose neighbourhood the mains pass, but there is no general compulsion of the very large kind suggested by the noble Lord. Therefore all three propositions more or less go by the board, and in these circumstances it does not seem to me altogether wise to give a Second Reading to the Bill.<lb/>
If we are to lay it down as a proposition that the Second Reading of a Bill of this kind merely means that the subject is one for inquiry, well by all means read it a second time, though I do not think that it is quite a proper course for this House to pursue. I do think that there ought to be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0474"/>
<col>941</col>
some inquiry, and I am sure the Local Government Board would gladly agree to an inquiry of that kind. It is worth noting that in one of the Reports&#x2014;the Report issued in 1903&#x2014;of the very important Committee on sewage disposal, these words occur:&#x2014;
<quote>"In regard to the further question, it appears to us that the central authority might, with the aid of the Rivers Boards, collect such information as is available in regard to waste of water by pumping from mines and in regard to the abstraction of water from one district to the supply of another district to the detriment of the district from which the water is taken."</quote>
What form the inquiry ought to take is a matter with regard to which we must ask for consideration. As to whether it should be a Select Committee of your Lordships' House, or a Joint Committee, or, as the noble Lord opposite suggested, a Departmental Committee, or some other form of inquiry, the House would hardly expect me to give an opinion without consulting with my right hon. friend, the President of the Board. So far as the Bill itself is concerned, it is obvious that it cannot become law this year, and I am quite sure that my noble friend opposite did not imagine that it would. Whether it is worth while reading it a second time in the rather peculiar circumstances I have stated I must leave to your Lordships to decide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02150"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is quite clear from the attitude the noble Earl has taken that he is fortunate enough not to live in a county which suffers from the present state of the law with regard to water supplies. I am differently situated. I live in the unfortunate county of Hertfordshire, which has suffered more than any other county in this matter. The noble Earl does not realise how acutely public opinion is excited in that county, which is being robbed continually of its underground water supplies to provide water for London. To those who live in the county this is an intolerable grievance, for we are perpetually being called upon to spend our money in appearing before Parliamentary Committees in order to protect ourselves. With regard to the form of inquiry, I do not agree that a Departmental Committee would be the best form in the present case, because what we are seeking is some general arrangement which should govern the Committees of both Houses of Parliament, and a Departmental Committee has no authority&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02151"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I understood that the question was wider than that, because the Bill refers to schemes which do not come before Parliament.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02152"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>:It may be wider, but a Select Committee would be capable of dealing with the wider issue whereas a Departmental Committee would not be capable of dealing with the narrower issue. The finding of a Select or a Joint Committee would be more binding, and, therefore, it appears to me that the matter should be referred to a Committee of that kind I should like to say a word as to the criticisms which the noble Earl made on my noble friend's proposals? He criticised the three principles and said they had been abandoned by those who had spoken on the Bill. In my opinion the noble Earl greatly overstated the case. No doubt there were criticisms, but in no case was the fundamental principle called into question. The noble Earl has entirely confused matters of principle with matters of detail. I think that my noble friend has established a <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case in favour of some remedy being applied to the present state of things, and in those circumstances I think your Lordships should agree to the Second Reading of the Bill; leaving the question of sending it to a Committee&#x2014;and I should favour such an inquiry myself&#x2014;for subsequent consideration.</membercontribution></p>

and to insert the two new clauses set out in his Amendment. He explained that the Amendment had been put down at the request of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. The noble Viscount had called the attention of the promoters of the Bill to the fact that it was desirable that the county council should not appoint one of its own officers to perform the duties of registrar without the special consent of the Lord Chancellor. Under the Bill as it stood it was considered that the Lord Chancellor already had that power, but he was very glad to insert words which would lay greater emphasis upon that.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02168"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> had given notice that he would move, on Third Reading, the insertion of the following new clause&#x2014;
<quote>"(1) This Act shall cease to be in force on the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and twelve, provided that if within one month preceding that date the Secretary for Scotland certifies his opinion that trawling has practically ceased to be carried on in the Moray Firth; it shall be lawful for His Majesty in Council to direct that the Act shall continue in force as regards Scotland, notwithstanding this clause, and in such case the Act shall continue in force as regards Scotland until Parliament shall otherwise provide.</quote>
<quote>(2) The by-law of the Scottish Fishery Board prohibiting trawling in the Moray Firth beyond the three mile limit from low water mark shall be in force so long only as this Act shall be in force as regards Scotland."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02169">The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is not my intention to move the new clause of which I have given notice. That clause was for the purpose of inserting a time limit in the Bill. I find that there is considerable difference of opinion amongst those who think there ought to be a time limit to this Bill as to the particular form of the clause, and it certainly would not be worth while to ask your Lordships to occupy time in discussing the form of such a clause, the more so as I had not intended to press my Amendment if Lord Pentland on behalf of the Government objected to it. But I hope your Lordships will permit me to say a few words on the Third Reading of the Bill. The question I put is this, whether the Bill as it is now framed will, in fact, carry out its purpose of putting an end to foreign trawling in the Moray Firth and in the other prohibited areas in Scotland. I think everybody admits that the prohibition of British trawlers to fish in these areas while foreign vessels are permitted to trawl there with impunity is a very great scandal and one which ought to be abated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02170">The question is whether this Bill, which proposes to put a stop to foreign trawlers fishing in these areas by the indirect method of prohibiting the sale of their fish in British ports, will be successful in its object. On that point a good deal of light has been thrown by some information given
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0476"/>
<col>945</col>
to the House after the Committee Stage of the Bill in answer to a question put to my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland. Lord Pentland then informed the House that in 1908 no fewer than 39 foreign vessels, or vessels under foreign flags, were observed trawling in the Moray Firth. Of these, fourteen were under the Norwegian flag, ten under the Belgian flag, and the others were sailing under the Swedish, Danish and Dutch flags. It may be, and probably is, the case that a very large number of these 39 vessels are, in fact, what my noble friend called <i>pseudo</i>-foreigners&#x2014;that is to say, they are practically British-owned vessels registered in foreign countries but manned and commanded by foreigners. So far as I have been able to ascertain, that is the case with the vessels which have been registered in Norway and Belgium, but it is not the case with the vessels trawling in this bay which are registered in Denmark, Sweden and Holland. My noble friend gave some further information bearing on this subject. He told us that of the 39 vessels observed in the Moray Firth 29 brought their fish to market in British ports, the remaining ten taking their fish to foreign ports. It is quite certain that those ten vessels will continue to fish there and to take their fish to foreign ports. Therefore, so far as those ten vessels are concerned the Bill will be in-operative. The question is whether the other 29 will be precluded from trawling in the Moray Firth by the fact that they will be prohibited from bringing their fish to British ports in future. That, of course, is a matter of surmise. On this point, again, I think a good deal of light is thrown by the statistics given in the report of the British Fishery Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02171">One of the most notable facts in the North Sea of late years has been the enormous increase in the number of foreign steam trawlers fishing there. As recently as the year 1904 there were 179 foreign trawlers fishing in the North Sea, and three years later the number had increased to 376. Of these, the German vessels in 1904 numbered 118, but they had increased to 239 in the later year. During the same period the number of British vessels, although very much larger than that, had not increased substantially in number. Therefore the increase of fishing in the North Sea during the last three or four years has been mainly confined to foreign trawlers. These vessels fish in every part
<col>946</col>
of the North Sea, and evidently find no difficulty in securing a market for their fish in foreign ports. It seems to me that if the Moray Firth is open to fishing by foreign vessels these steam trawlers owned by foreigners will find their way there, and will experience no difficulty whatever in selling their fish in markets in the North of Europe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02172">Then it is said that, even if this Bill should fail in prohibiting foreign vessels from trawling in the Moray Firth, it will, at all events, strengthen the hands of our Government in their negotiations with other Powers in the direction of some general understanding with a view to a general prohibition of vessels trawling in the Moray Firth and other prohibited areas. This was dealt with and exposed by Lord Fitzmaurice last year in the course of the debate which arose on the Motion of Lord Heneage. Lord Fitzmaurice then said that for the last twelve years the British Government had been endeavouring in vain to come to some understanding on the matter, but the other countries would not give their consent to any such arrangement. He added very significantly that in order to induce them to give their consent the British Government would have on its part to make concessions to other Governments which might be detrimental to British fishermen. I think, therefore, we may dismiss from our minds the possibility of other countries in the North of Europe coming to an agreement with our Government for a general prohibition of trawling in the Moray Firth and other prohibited areas. Looking, then, all round at the question, it seems to me most improbable that this Bill will result in preventing trawling in the Moray Firth and other prohibited areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02173">I admit the extreme difficulty of the whole question, and I am very far from saying that my noble friend, looking at public opinion in Scotland on the subject, was not justified in making this experiment; but I believe it will be the last experiment in the direction of endeavouring to prevent foreign trawlers fishing in the bay. I cannot but think that this experiment will not succeed, and that in two years time we shall have again to face this question. My belief is that the better plan, on the whole, is to throw these prohibited areas open to all countries. But I am not a fanatic on the subject, and if this Bill should be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0477"/>
<col>947</col>
successful in its operation I should prefer that solution to the existing state of things. At the same time I feel bound, on the Third Reading, to say that, having given the subject great consideration for many years, it is my conviction that the Bill will not succeed in its object, and that Parliament will be compelled in a very short time to reopen the question and deal with it in another manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02174"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before this discussion closes I should like to say a word or two in answer to the remarks of the noble Lord who has just sat down. I am very glad, indeed, that he is not proposing to put any time limit into this Bill. I think that if that proposal were made and carried it would have this bad effect, that it would seem to imply that the Government of this country were not in earnest in endeavouring to stop trawling within these narrow seas. I believe that the Government of this country are in earnest in this matter if they can possibly bring it about, and I think they are supported in this proposal by an immense majority of those of both political Parties at all events around the coast of Scotland.<lb/>
I think this matter has a very much wider aspect than the mere question of whether a certain number of trawlers, be they foreign or British, should trawl in the Moray Firth. In my humble opinion the matter goes very much deeper than that. It really goes to the whole question &#x2014;a very much larger one&#x2014;of whether or not we are really depleting the stock of fish in the North Sea. I know that the noble Lord does not agree with the theory that the stock of fish is being depleted in the North Sea. I am bound to say that such evidence as I have been able to consider shows that certain kinds of fish are getting scarcer, that greater exertions have to be made to get a paying take, that those who fish for certain classes of flat fish have to go further asea to get a paying take, and considering the number of men employed and the size of the vessels engaged in this trade the returns of the catches conclusively show that there is a real danger of the supply of fish in the North Sea being seriously diminished.<lb/>
I do not go into the narrower question at the moment of whether or not this proposal will really put an end to trawling
<col>948</col>
in the narrow seas. I believe it will, and I do not think that those who prompted the noble Lord to place his Amendment on the Paper and to make the dismal prophecies he has put forward are not the people who will do their utmost to bring those prophecies to a successful realisation. The people who have been opposing these proposals are just those who place every obstacle in the way, and give the idea abroad that this country is not in earnest in the matter. I believe that if this Bill passes, as I think it will now pass, we shall have a better foothold for negotiations with foreign Powers which may have the desired effect of securing certain areas secluded from trawling in order that they may be preserved as breeding grounds for certain classes of flat fish. There can be no doubt that vast quantities of undersized fish of the most valuable kinds are caught in the Moray Firth and in other similar areas.<lb/>
The whole desire of the Scottish Office and the Scottish Fishery Board has been that for a period of years the experiment should be practically tried of whether by leaving these breeding grounds undisturbed you will not do something to prevent the depletion of the stock in the North Sea. I quite agree that it is impossible to look with complacence on the fact that people who are fishing under foreign flags, whether they are really foreign subjects or only colourably so, should have an advantage over genuine British fishermen. None of us desire that, but we want this experiment tried over a series of years to see whether it will be successful. The point is that it never has been tried. If after a reasonable period of years the experiment is proved not to be successful and not to be increasing the stock of fish, then there will be a very much better case than there is at the present time for doing away with the whole policy of these restrictions.<lb/>
I conclude by expressing an earnest hope that when this Bill is passed the British Foreign Office, in spite of past discouragement, will approach other Powers to see whether they cannot come to some agreement, which I believe would be for the advantage of all countries concerned. I do not want to keep the Moray Firth as the only protected area. If this subject is approached from the broad and wide standpoint of what is best for the general food supply you will have a much better chance
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0478"/>
<col>949</col>
of success. I believe that the authorities of other countries are becoming alarmed on the subject. They are finding that it is not so easy to get supplies of fish as it once was. Prices have gone up, the catches are not so remunerative as they were, and I believe that if the question is approached, not from a selfish standpoint but from the standpoint of general advantage, a much better chance will be afforded of arriving at a satisfactory conclusion. I congratulate my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland on having got this Bill through both Houses of Parliament, and I sincerely hope that, having got it, the Government will do what they can to carry the matter a step further and see that the experiment, which for the last twenty years many of the most enlightened persons have desired should be tried, shall be tried under the best auspices.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02175"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if by powerful interests ranged against the Bill the noble Lord who has just sat down meant the very large trawling industry which exists all along the East Coast of England and up to Aberdeen, I venture to think that is an industry and an interest which your Lordships cannot afford entirely to neglect. I cannot help feeling that there may be difficulties in the administration of this Bill. There have been such difficulties in the past, and mistakes have been made. On several occasions the wrong number has been taken, with the result that the wrong vessel has been prosecuted, and it is quite likely that mistakes that have occurred in the past may occur again. Therefore I am somewhat sorry that your Lordships decided, on the Report Stage, to reverse the decision which had been arrived at by the Standing Committee, and which eliminated certain words giving to the customs authorities under this Bill all the powers conferred upon them by the Customs Consolidation Act. These powers are very extensive indeed, and amount to the seizure of the ship. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill, in urging your Lordships to go back upon that decision, gave an intimation that it was not the intention to do more than to confiscate the cargo of fish and to take legal proceedings against the owner of the vessel; there was no intention to confiscate the vessel itself. I will not ask your Lordships, on Third Reading, to reverse the decision you came to on Report, but it would be satisfactory to those who are concerned in trawling operations along the
<col>950</col>
East Coast of England if we could have from the noble Lord a distinct and categorical assurance that it is not the intention of the Government, by the retention of those words, to impose all the heavier penalties which can be imposed under the Customs Consolidation Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02176"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to your Lordships for the consideration with which this Bill has been treated this evening, and to my noble friend Lord Eversley for having foregone the moving of the Amendment he had placed on the Paper. Perhaps your Lordships will excuse me from entering on this occasion into a discussion of the prophecies which have been made as to the ultimate effect of this measure. I think there is some ground for believing that its operation will be effectual, and I share the hope of Lord Balfour of Burleigh that that will be the case. In reply to the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who asked me a question as to the intentions of the Government in respect to putting into force the penal clauses, I repeat with pleasure the assurance which I gave at an earlier stage of this Bill. There is no departure from precedent in including in this Bill the penal clauses of the Customs Consolidation Act, but there is no special intention in this Bill, no greater intention in this Bill than in any other similar Bills which have included these penal clauses, of putting into force the further and more drastic clauses to which he has alluded. The view of the Government all along has been that it is desirable that these clauses should remain in the Bill more as sanctions to procedure under the Act than for any other purpose; and I hope that what I have now said will operate in some degree as an assurance to any of those who are apprehensive as to the course being followed which Lord Onslow has named.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"2.&#x2014;(1) The Board of Trade may make general regulations with respect to the management of labour exchanges established or assisted under this Act, and otherwise with respect to the exercise of their powers under this Act, and such regulations may, subject to the approval of the Treasury, authorise advances to be made by way of loan towards meeting the expenses of workpeople travelling to places where employment has been found for them through a labour exchange.</quote>
<quote>(2) The regulations shall provide that no person shall suffer any disqualification or be otherwise prejudiced on account of refusing to accept employment found for him through a labour exchange where the ground of refusal is that a trade dispute exists, or that the wages offered are lower than those current in the trade in the district where the employment is offered.</quote>
<quote>(3) Any general regulations made under this section shall have effect as if enacted in this Act, but shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after they are made, and if either House of Parliament within the next forty days after any regulations have been so laid before that House resolves that the regulations or any of them ought to be annulled, the regulations or those to which the resolution applies shall, after the date of such resolution, be of no effect without prejudice to the validity of anything done in the meantime under the regulations or to the making of any new regulations.</quote>
<quote>(4) Subject to any such regulations, the powers of the Board of Trade under this Act shall be exercised in such manner as the Board of Trade may direct.</quote>
<quote>(5) The Board of Trade may, in such cases as they think fit, establish advisory committees for the purpose of giving the Board advice and assistance in connection with the management of any labour exchange."</quote>
He first moved to insert, after the word "prejudiced" at the beginning of subsection (2), the words "in being afforded facilities under this Act for obtaining employment." He thought the subsection as it stood was exceedingly vague. The particular occasion on which it was sought to protect a workman from disqualification or prejudice was vaguely stated, and the particular disqualification or prejudice was not stated at all, and it might be a disqualification or prejudice having no relation to labour exchanges whatever. Neither this Amendment nor the others standing on the Paper in his name were of an aggressive kind; they were really little more than drafting.</p>

He did not think that if the clause was carefully read that view could be held, because the clause dealt with the regulations that might be made by the Board of Trade, and such regulations could not affect anyone outside the labour exchange.

Your Lordships will recollect that what happened was that on the Second Reading I undertook that the Committee stage should not be taken for three weeks, in order to allow a period for negotiations to take place. Those negotiations went on till last Friday, and therefore the notice for the Committee stage of the Bill was necessarily rather short, but we thought that those interested would be in a position to go on with the Bill in the time. But we do not wish to hurry the Bill in any way, though it is a very important Bill and one which we hope to see passed into law in the course of the session; and as we have been asked to put the Committee stage off we are willing to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02220"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are obliged to the noble Lord for the considerate statement he has made, though I do not think he told quite the whole story which seems to me a justification for asking for the postponement of this stage of the Bill. It is perfectly true that the negotiations with the insurance companies lasted for a good many weeks&#x2014;they lasted until Friday of last week, and it was at a meeting of the insurance com-
<col>956</col>
panies on Friday that they received an intimation from the Board of Trade that their Amendments would not be accepted and that the Committee stage would be taken this week. The Bill was down for Committee, yesterday, and if you consider that of the four days which elapsed between the Friday and Wednesday one was a Sunday and the other a Bank Holiday you will see that the opportunity for consideration of what Amendments should be moved and how they should be drafted was rather too short. Those who are anxious to secure Amendments did their best and we placed some Amendments down last night, but I am conscious that they are not worded quite in the best form. Some of them are only alternative, and therefore are not in a form in which it is very convenient to argue them. I think I am justified in saying that it would be a little too hurried to go on with the Bill to-day, because only this morning a very large number of Amendments of considerable substance were put down in the name of the noble Lord who represents the Board of Trade. The Bill is one of thirty-six clauses, and there are thirty pages of schedules. It deals with the amendment of the law in regard to companies doing life assurance and fire and accident insurance business. It is a very technical Bill, and I am advised that it is not altogether consistent in some of its parts. Any one will see that a Bill which has for its objects&#x2014;as set forth in the Memorandum prefixed to the Bill&#x2014;the consolidation and amendment of the Life Assurance Companies Acts, 1870 and 1872, and of the Employers' Liability Insurance Companies Act, 1907, and the extension to companies carrying on fire insurance business and accident insurance business of the law relating to life assurance companies cannot be a simple measure. I am not connected with any insurance companies, of any sort or kind, but I am authorised to say that there is no hostility to the main provisions of the Bill. I believe that those concerned are most willing to see it passed into law. They hope for some Amendments, and with the further time which has been granted I believe those Amendments will be put down in the best possible form so as to lead to the smallest amount of discussion, and I hope that some of the Amendments placed on the Paper by Lord Hamilton to-day will make it unnecessary to proceed with some of the Amendments standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ROYAL DECLARATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02222"><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether the meeting of the Parliament on 14th February, 1901, was the meeting of the first Parliament summoned next after the accession of His Most Gracious Majesty, or the first meeting in the present reign of a pre-existing Parliament; and, if the latter, whether the Royal Declaration enacted by the Act of 1688, and made in Parliament on 14th February, 1901, was made in pursuance of the said Bill of Rights which enacts that it shall be made by every King or Queen thereafter coming to the Crown on the first day of the meeting of the first Parliament next after his or her coming to the Crown or at his or her Coronation (whichever shall first happen); and, if not, whether or not it was in fact made on the first day of the meeting by His Gracious Majesty of the Second Session of the last Parliament of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria, which first met on 3rd, December, 1900, and was prolonged by force and in virtue of the Representation of the People Act, 1867, in spite of the demise of the Crown; and whether, if then and so made, the said Declaration had or has any statutory or other sanction whatsoever.<lb/>
This Question is a somewhat long one in, appearance, but it can be compressed into a much shorter compass. The question arises whether the present Parliament was the first Parliament of the present reign. As a mere layman I speak in fear and trembling before the legal luminaries in your Lordships' House, but it seems to me there is no doubt that this Parliament is the first Parliament of the present reign. If that is the case, the Declaration that was enacted by William and Mary in 1688 was not taken at the time that that Statute enacted that it should be taken, and therefore, if taken at another time and in other circumstances, it is evident it has no Parliamentary sanction and ought to be expunged from the Journals of this House although taken here. If we cast a glance at history we find that what happened at the beginning of this reign in 1901 did not happen in all the previous reigns during which this Declaration was in force. I
<col>958</col>
presume that Queen Anne was the first Sovereign to take this Declaration and she took it at her Coronation, and there is no doubt whatever that the Declaration was made by George I. at his Coronation.<lb/>
But coming down to more modern times we find that in the last reign, which commenced in 1837, the Declaration was taken at the meeting of the first Parliament, which is the alternative permitted by the Statute of 1688, whichever should happen first, the Coronation or the meeting of the first Parliament. It was taken on November 20, 1837; but a different event occurred in 1901. For some reason, of which I am not aware, the Declaration was made in a very great hurry only a few days after the accession. Why this hurry I do not presume to conjecture. I may remind your Lordships that in 1696 an Act was passed in which Parliament was prolonged for six months after the demise of the Crown, but in 1867 a clause was inserted in the Representation of the People Act by which it was enacted that the Parliament should continue at the demise of the Crown as if that demise had not taken place&#x2014;that is to say, it should share the fate of any, ordinary Parliament and go on either until it expired or until it dissolved. Those who drafted that Bill were not thinking for one instant, of course, of the curious circumstances to which I have alluded&#x2014;namely, that this Declaration should be taken either at the Coronation or the meeting of the first Parliament&#x2014;and therefore they made no allusion whatever to it. And here I may incidentally say that nobody, either in Parliament or out of Parliament, during the last reign called any attention to this Declaration. It escaped the notice of everybody, except, perhaps, a few individuals who from time to time have called attention to it as an antiquarian monstrosity. But the country generally knew nothing about it, and it was not until the year 1901 that it cropped up and caused general excitement and in a large portion of the community deep-seated indignation and disgust.<lb/>
I will not enter upon the subject-matter, which has been gone into in great detail on more than one occasion since 1901, but I would remind your Lordships, in justification for my calling attention to the matter at all, that both in this House and in another place the subject of this question has been denounced by the highest authority.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0483"/>
<col>959</col>
The late Lord Salisbury, when Prime Minister, denounced the Declaration as indecent; he also called it "a stain on the Statute Book." These were very emphatic words, and words of great importance as falling from the lips of the Prime Minister of this country in your Lordships' House. But to come to a later period and to bring the matter, so to speak, up to date, I may remind your Lordships that only the other day the present Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, denounced this Declaration in language almost as emphatic; at all events, the burden of his speech was to the effect that if he had the power he would tear it out of the Statute Book and that it had no right to be there at all. So that in giving utterance to the wish that the day may not be far distant when this stain on the Statute Book shall be removed I am not speaking merely for myself. In that case I would not ask your Lordships to listen to me; but I am stating views in accord with those of the late Prime Minister and the present Prime Minister representing both political parties. I am also speaking in sympathy with twelve million subjects whose faith is grossly insulted and held up to ridicule and obloquy, not only before this country but before three hundred and fifty millions, if that be the right figure, of the inhabitants of India, whose religious faiths, by the way, are not denounced though ours is.<lb/>
I recollect going across Canada one summer and having audiences with all the Archbishops separately in their own provinces, and asking what they wished to be done by way of application for the removal of this Declaration. The answer I received from all of them was that they left the matter to the Imperial Parliament, however desirous they might be of raising local agitation; and in an interview at Ottawa with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the eminent Prime Minister of Canada, I met with the same sympathy that I received from ecclesiastical quarters. He, too, promised that he would do all in his power to aid in the removal of the Declaration, but he left it to the Imperial Parliament. I have always found, I am glad to say, in the Colonies that the reverence for the Imperial Parliament, which they call the Mother of Parliaments, is very great, and no initiation of a matter of this kind would take place in the Colonies unless they took their cue and their example from the Imperial Parliament.<lb/>
<col>960</col>
Well, my Lords, here we are in the Imperial Parliament. We have had certain indications in the House of Commons of how they regard this Declaration. We also had long and painful discussions in this House in 1901, 1903 and 1904, in which your Lordships were severally invited to give your opinions as to the desirability of removing this Declaration from the Statute Book. Nothing, however, came of those discussions, and it is in order to keep the matter alive and to keep it above water that I have ventured from time to time to bring the subject again to your Lordships' notice. There is no doubt that, if this House had its way, there would be no discussion about this matter, and the "indecency" to which Lord Salisbury referred would be removed. The power which prevents that course being taken is the Puritan power in this country, but I feel convinced that if your Lordships were only to take your courage in your hands and give a Second Reading to a Bill for this purpose no opposition in the country would be maintained for a month or for a week.<lb/>
It is self-evident in these times, when persecution for religion has passed away, at all events in this country, that this gross anomaly should no longer remain. The civil disabilities under which Roman Catholics laboured were so great that no persons professing that faith could sit in either House of Parliament until the year 1829. Now there are several of that faith in your Lordships' House, and many in the other House. The penal laws were not only cruel, but they were vexatious. No Catholic could come within five miles of London, no Catholic could inherit real property; another enactment was that no Catholic could possess a horse of the value of over &#x00A3;5, etc., etc., etc. All these laws have been rightly abolished, but this Declaration still remains; it ought to have gone with the others, and I have therefore brought the matter once more before your Lordships' attention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02223"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord will agree that this Question is rather argumentative as it appears on the Paper, and it shares the vice, if I may so, of most argumentative questions that it seeks to exact an assent to certain preliminary conditions before an answer is to be given to the question which is put at the end. I

<col>961</col>
hope that the noble Lord will excuse me in not following him into the historical arguments he has laid before the House, but on the merits I may say that in my opinion it is thoroughly wrong that an Act of Parliament should require from the Sovereign or from any man that he should insult the religious opinions held sacred by any person in this kingdom. The noble Lord, I presume, really wishes to know whether the Declaration made by his present Majesty is valid or not in law. In my opinion undoubtedly the Declaration is perfectly valid according to law.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE UP-KEEP OF CHURCH CHANCELS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02224"><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether they are prepared to lay on the Table of the House a Return of the parishes in England and Wales in which the chancel of the parish church must be kept in repair by the lay-rector and impropriator of the great tithes, or by the lay-rector, or by the impropriator of the great tithes, and in how many instances at the present time the lay-rector or the impropriator of the great tithes is a dissenter from the Established Church, and nevertheless is compelled by law to pay for the sustentation of the chancel, and whether they will introduce any measure with a view to relieve such persons, either wholly or in part, of their liability; to ask if there are any parishes in England or Wales where the sustentation of the chancel of the parish church is by law a burden wholly or in part on any manorial property in land in the parish, although such property is not owned by the rector of the parish, and if so, how many lords of such manors there are liable to this burden, and how many (if any) such persons are dissenters from the Establishment.<lb/>
Since Church rates were abolished fifty years ago or more there appears to be no liability whatever upon any person or persons to build up the parish church if it falls down or gets out of repair in any small degree whatever. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, or, I should say, in 999 cases out of a thousand, the parishioners, of course, are only too glad to come forward with voluntary contributions to build up the nave of the parish church if it falls into disrepair, but there is no obligation whatever, as far as I am aware, that they should do so. I think that is a curious fact,
<col>962</col>
and one that is very often overlooked. The incumbent is not entitled to exact any rate or tax from the parishioners to build up the nave, and, therefore, if the parishioners were so minded they might, I presume, however interesting the building might be and however precious in the eyes of an antiquarian, allow it to fall into ruins. But with regard to the chancel it is quite a different thing. It appears that the rector there is subjected to a tax or the obligation of building up the chancel, and it would be interesting to know how many cases there are where the rector is a lay-rector and is responsible, and it would be still more interesting to know in how many cases that lay-rector is not a member of the Establishment. For it seems to me that there not only a hardship but an injustice comes in, because the lay-rector in that case who is a dissenter from the Church of England, whether he be a Jew, or a Nonconformist, or a Catholic, is obliged to pay for the sustentation of the Church.<lb/>
I think the present Government, which professedly boast of liberal ideas of an extreme type, might take into their consideration whether it would not be just to that small body of persons to relieve them of their liability&#x2014;that is to say, to relieve them of the necessity of paying a tax which may be, in individual cases, a very heavy one, amounting to several hundreds of pounds, to sustain a building of which they cannot make any use and which belongs to an alien religion. The lay-rector, although he is, in theory, the freeholder of the chancel, is not entitled to lock the chancel up or to make any use of it whatever. All he has to do is to build it up when it falls down, and this is rather a hardship upon any person who does not have any use of the building and who cannot in the nature of the case use it as a place of worship. I think, therefore, that the suggestion which I have made in my Question may not be unworthy of the consideration of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02225"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to say that the Government are not able to comply with the wishes of the noble Lord. The information that he asks for is information which the Government are not able to obtain; and even if they could obtain it I am afraid that there would be a great deal of trouble and expense involved in obtaining the returns asked for. The Ecclesiastical Commis-

<col>963</col>
sioners have been communicated with on this subject, and they state that they have not in their possession the materials for furnishing this information, and have not any means of procuring it. I am afraid that it would involve a very large inquiry locally into the tenure and conditions of holding property. I am sorry, therefore, that the Government are not able to promise the information which the noble Lord desires.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02226"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, had the Question been asked as it appears on the Paper and received the inevitable reply which has been given to it by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, I should not have said a word. But the speech of the noble Lord imparted a different complexion to the Question. The noble Lord spoke of this as being a tax on certain persons, and he looked upon it as being unfair if the taxpayer, as he described him, happened not to belong to the Church of England as at present established in this country. But there is no tax in this matter at all. The noble Lord or those who went before him acquired certain property subject to certain liabilities; but those liabilities are not a tax. A certain amount of land, for example, is bought subject to the liability to pay tithe; but this liability for tithe is no tax. Persons are liable to pay this tithe and they would be presumably called to account if it was not paid. The grounds on which they pay tithe are precisely similar to those upon which the noble Lord or any other owner of rectorial rights is liable to certain charges. The property was liable to certain charges when it was acquired, and those charges remain on the property as long as the holder owns it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE COAL MINES (EIGHT HOURS) ACT.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02227"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: I rise to ask whether it is the intention of His Majesty's
<col>964</col>
Government to introduce during the present session a Bill to amend the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1908. In putting this Question I merely desire to observe that this Act only came into operation on July 1 last, that the reduction in output on the average amounts, I understand, to something like nine per cent., and that at the beginning of July when a Cabinet Minister was seeking re-election he found the effect of this particular Act so unpopular that he was obliged to promise an amending Act on the earliest available opportunity. I should rather doubt whether in the history of Parliament there has ever been an occasion upon which no less than a week after an Act has been in operation a Minister of the Crown has had to go down to his constituents and promise that it shall be altered in order to get himself returned. Personally I am all in favour of amending the Act, but I am rather wondering how it is to be carried out, and I ask this Question to ascertain whether the amending Act will be introduced in this House or in another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02228"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to spoil the picture which was drawn by the noble Lord, and which I think was more entertaining than accurate. But, as a matter of fact, it is the intention of the Government to introduce a very small measure at an early date. The measure is designed to meet a point of difficulty that has arisen under the operation of the Act with regard to the time of beginning work. It is understood to have the general assent of both employer and employed, as far as opinion on the subject has been expressed. It is hoped that after all it will prove to be a non-contentious measure, and have a happy passage through both Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02298"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before this Bill leaves your Lordships' House I should like to make a few remarks upon it. Some of us in the West Riding of Yorkshire were, in the first instance, rather concerned about this Bill, because there the Registrar of Deeds happens to hold a very important position. We are particularly lucky in our Registrar of Deeds; he does his work exceedingly well. The present law is that no person shall be appointed Registrar of Deeds unless he gives his whole time to the office and has gone through a certain legal training. This Bill seeks to go behind that, and I will tell your Lordships, if I may, why I think this change is proposed. In the East Riding of Yorkshire they are particularly fortunate in having a very able, energetic, and popular clerk of the council. It is possible that there may be a vacancy in the position of Registrar of Deeds, and the County Council of the East
<col>974</col>
Riding would like the Clerk to the Council also to become Registrar. It would save money, and they think that this gentleman would do the work very well. That is not contradicted at all. The Clerk to the Council would do the work excellently, but he is not legally able to take the position because he will not give his whole time to it. This Bill is to enable him to take the position. As I say, we in the West Riding when we came to look at the Bill in the first instance were not quite satisfied that a Registrar should be appointed unless he would give his whole time to the work and had gone through certain legal training. But we are now satisfied, because it is laid down in the Bill that no person not fulfilling the two requirements I have stated shall be appointed Registrar unless the appointment has the special sanction of the Lord Chancellor.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02301" align="center"><b>[SECOND READING.]</b></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02302">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02303"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the main object of this Bill is the establishment of a minimum rate of wages in certain trades in which what is termed sweating is well known to exist. The establishment by Statute of a minimum rate of wages is, I suppose, a novel expedient, but your Lordships are aware that regulation of the conditions of labour in certain trades is by no means new, and that ever since the passing of the first Factory Act Parliament has, from time to time, agreed to legislation having that object. Only last year your Lordships agreed to a Bill limiting the hours of labour in mines. I have lived all my life amongst miners, and I never doubted for a moment that the passing of that Bill was a right and a just measure; but I confess that I
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0491"/>
<col>975</col>
had an uneasy feeling, not with regard to those whom the Bill affected, but with regard to those who were not included in it. I felt, and I think many of your Lordships may have felt, that besides the miners&#x2014;and I am sure we do not grudge them their good-luck&#x2014;there were many other people, helpless people, with no political or other organisation, who stood in equal need of help. Therefore I am glad, and I believe your Lordships will be glad, that the case of those poor and helpless people is now to be dealt with. But I admit that that is a sentimental consideration, and it is a consideration which is, perhaps, out of place in dealing with a Bill which is not based upon sentiment but upon hard solid facts.<lb/>
I think the facts are well known to us all. Every one knows what sweating is, and every one acknowledges it to be a great evil. It is not a new thing. It has been known to exist and its existence has been noted for the last fifty years or more. I do not suppose that during the last twenty years there is any feature of our social system which has been so much inquired into, so much spoken about, and so much written about as the evil of sweating; and the Government are of opinion that the time has now come when the only practical remedy should be applied. It is not only in this country that sweating has excited attention. It has excited attention in practically every civilised country, and in Germany, in particular, I understand that legislation on this subject is imminent. I would commend that fact to any one who may be afraid that by legislation of this sort trade in this country may be driven abroad; and I would point out that even if we do move a little faster in this matter than other countries, and if we do take the lead, as in a matter of this sort I think we ought to take the lead, we shall probably not maintain that lead indefinitely, because other countries are moving, and moving very fast, in the same direction.<lb/>
I shall not attempt to coin a new definition of sweating. There are many such in circulation already, but I will take what I believe to be the ordinary meaning of the word&#x2014;the payment by an employer to his workpeople of a wage which is insufficient to purchase for them the necessaries of life; and in bringing forward this Bill I would simply ask your Lordships whether or not
<col>976</col>
you consider that such wages ought to continue to be paid. I do not think that there can be more than one answer to such a question. It is already, to our credit as a nation, a punishable offence in this country to allow an animal which is dependent upon us to starve, and it does not seem very much to ask that the same principle should be extended to human beings. When an insufficient wage is paid something approaching starvation must take place, perhaps not actually in the matter of food, but in poorness of clothing, poorness of lodging, and bad quality of food&#x2014;that is, unless the insufficient wages are supplemented from some other source. There are cases, of course, in which the wages are so supplemented. In some cases that may be done by charitable relief, perhaps rather misplaced charitable relief, and even I believe by Poor Law relief in some form or another. I think it might fairly be said that a trade which cannot exist without such assistance must be a thoroughly rotten one and a trade of which we should be well rid.<lb/>
But, as a matter of fact, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that any trade will either be killed or driven abroad by this Bill, and I do not think that any better proof of that is needed than the warm support which has been given to this Bill by almost all of those, both masters and men, connected with the trades mentioned in the Schedule. What we imagine will happen will be that a levelling-up process will take place. The best class of employer, the man who pays fair wages now, will continue to pay fair wages; the second class of employer, the man who we have reason to believe would like to pay fair wages but is afraid of having his prices undercut by the class immediately below him, will be enabled to pay fair wages; and the third class of employer, the genuine sweater, will have to pay fair wages whether he likes it or not. There is one source from which wages may be supplemented which I have not mentioned, and which falls under a rather different heading. There are certain people, principally women, who wish to earn a little money but are not really dependent on the trade for their living, such as girls living at home with their family or married women who have no children to look after. It sometimes happens that for the purpose of earning a few shillings, a little spending money, such people are willing to accept
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0492"/>
<col>977</col>
considerably less than the market rate of wages, and it may perhaps be said that if both parties are agreeable to that arrangement there is no reason to interfere. But I think, my Lords, that it is necessary to look a little deeper than that, and if we do it will be seen that it is far from right that those people, for the purpose of earning a little pocket money, should drag down the level of wages and inflict serious injury on people who have to depend on the trade for their living. There is no reason why these people should not be paid at the same rate as any other people doing the same work. If their work is worth having, it must be worth paying for. If they only devote part of their time to this work they will naturally not earn as much in a day as a person of equal ability who devotes the whole day to the work. But the point is that the rate should be the same. There is no reason why it should not be, and therefore we do not propose to make any exception in those cases.<lb/>
Four trades have been selected for the purposes of the Bill, and they are set out in the Schedule. They are certain parts of the tailoring trade, the paper-box making trade, certain parts of the commoner lace and net finishing trade, and certain parts of the chain-making trade. Those are all trades in which sweating is acknowledged to exist. There are provisions in the Bill to enable its extension to other trades, and it is the intention that trades carried on under similar circumstances shall be included. That will be done on the initiative of the Board of Trade, and will be carried out by means of a Provisional Order Bill. Thus your Lordships will see that the control of Parliament in the case of the inclusion of a new trade is absolutely maintained. What will happen will be this. The Board of Trade will say that in their opinion the Act ought to be extended to a certain trade, and a Provisional Order will be promoted in the ordinary way and passed through Parliament with the object of carrying that out. It will rest entirely with Parliament to say whether or not that Bill should pass. I should like to say here, as strongly as possible, that it is not fair, as has been done, to describe this Bill as being the thin end of a wedge. The scope of the Bill is absolutely defined, and there is no intention of using its provisions as a general means of regulating wages in all trades. If your Lordships will turn to subsection (2) of Clause 1, you will see that it is not possible that the Bill should
<col>978</col>
be so used. In that subsection the Board of Trade are only given power to make a Provisional Order&#x2014;
<quote>"if they are satisfied that the rate of wages prevailing in any branch of the trade is exceptionally low."</quote>
It will, therefore, be seen that the machinery for including a new trade can only be set in motion if those exceptional circumstances can be shown to exist.<lb/>
The machinery which it is proposed to set up is briefly this. For each of the scheduled trades a central Trade Board will be established, and where the distribution of the trade requires it the country will be divided into districts, in each of which a local committee will be established. The Trade Boards will consist of an equal number of employers and employed, together with a certain number of paid experts, who are alluded to in the Bill as "appointed members." The composition of the district trade committees will be very similar to that of the Trade Board itself. With regard to the duties of the Trade Board, the primary duty will be the fixing of a minimum rate of wages in the trade with which it deals. The process will be this. Each committee will recommend a certain rate of wages for its district. That recommendation will be made to the Trade Board, who, after consideration, will either approve or amend that rate. It will not be necessary for the Trade Board to fix a similar rate for the whole country. What they will do will be to take into consideration the general circumstances of the trade and the special circumstances of the district, and fix a rate which they consider to be fair having regard to all those circumstances. Notice will then be given that it is intended to fix this rate, and an interval of three months will be allowed in order that anyone who wishes to raise an objection may be given an opportunity of being heard. After that period the rate will come into operation to a limited extent. During the intermediate period, which will last six months, the rate will not be compulsory, and no penalties will be incurred by an employer who does not conform to it, but a list will be kept and will be open to public inspection of those employers who agree to abide by the rate. Further, it will be obligatory in the case of all Government and municipal contracts; and there is this other point, that wages at this rate will be recoverable as a civil debt in all cases in the absence
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0493"/>
<col>979</col>
of a written contract to the contrary. That concludes what I may describe as the intermediate stage.<lb/>
We now pass to the compulsory stage. After the lapse of six months from the date when notice was given of the rate fixed the Board of Trade must issue an Order either making the rate compulsory, in which cases the penalties for non-compliance will come into operation, or else the Board must make an Order postponing the compulsory stage. There are three forms of minimum rates of wages which may be fixed. First, there is the minimum time rate. That will be the ordinary rate, and it will operate, of course, in factories and in places which are under the immediate supervision of the employer. The next rate is the general minimum piece rate. That will be based Upon the time rate, and will operate to a certain extent in factories, and, of course, invariably in the case of home work. The Trade Board is not required to fix a general minimum piece rate, but it may do so where it considers it to be necessary. Then there is a third rate&#x2014;a special minimum piece rate&#x2014;which may be fixed by the Trade Board on the application of an employer and will apply to any particular article which cannot properly be covered by either of the two other rates. Where a minimum time rate but no general or special minimum piece rate has been fixed and the employer wishes to pay by piecework, the piece rate must be such that an ordinary worker working at this rate will earn not less than he would if paid by time. Besides the duty of fixing the minimum rate of wages the Trade Boards will be required to advise the various Government Departments on points connected with their trades, and in this direction they will be consultative and not executive bodies. We consider that they will be able to do a great deal of useful work in that way.<lb/>
I have described very briefly the object and scope of this Bill. Its object is the abolition of sweating, and to that object its scope is confined. The abolition of sweating is to be arrived at by the most simple and most direct means possible by securing that a wage on which it is possible to live shall invariably be paid in return for a fair day's work. I have admitted that the establishment of a minimum rate of wages is a new principle, and I understand that in certain quarters it has been objected to as being an undue interference with
<col>980</col>
freedom of contract between individuals. I am quite prepared to admit that interference with free right of contract might be carried to a length to which few, if any, of us would agree to go, but I do not think it can be said that that is done by the present Bill. The minimum wages proposed by this Bill are to be fixed by a Board which will be almost entirely composed of members of the trade affected. The functions of this Board will be very similar to those performed, in trades in which labour is organised, by the accredited representatives of the masters and men acting together, and acting in a manner which, I think, is generally recognised as being to the advantage of both parties.<lb/>
But there are certain important limitations in regard to these Trade Boards. In the first place, the Trade Board will only have to fix a minimum and not a standard rate of wages; and, in the second place, the Trade Board will only be called into existence in cases where the workpeople have shown themselves to be incapable of any action on their own behalf. I submit, my Lords, that the conditions in these extreme cases clearly call for legislative action, not only in the interests of the poor helpless people themselves, but also in the interests of the community. I know that there are many members of your Lordships' House who have taken, and do take, the very greatest interest in this question. There are many of your Lordships who have, I believe, devoted years to its study and to investigating its causes and its possible cure; and I feel that I can safely leave it to those noble Lords, who sit in all parts of the House, to supply the deficiencies of which I am painfully conscious in my advocacy of this measure.</membercontribution></p>

<col>981</col>
noble Lord has said, nothing that any of your Lordships can say will be an exaggeration of the pitifulness of the cases of which testimony was given before the Select Committee of the Commons.<lb/>
But my Lords, I thought, if I May be allowed to criticise the general tenor of the noble Lord's remarks, that he made too light of the difficulty of dealing with this subject. He said the procedure of the Bill was simple. I am not sure that I agree with him, but, even if the procedure of the Bill is simple, certainly the subject-matter with which the Bill deals is not simple, but, on the contrary, very complicated. It would be a mistake if your Lordships thought that the mass of home workers are sweated. The evidence appears to be conclusive in the other direction. Apparently, the majority of home workers are persons, no doubt working at a very low standard in the industrial scale, but perfectly able to look after themselves, and, in a sense, well-to-do. But there is a minority, a very considerable minority, a deplorable minority, in connection with whom those conditions do not obtain. Unfortunately, it is impossible to legislate with regard to one set of workers&#x2014;namely, those whom we pity&#x2014;without affecting the case of those workers who are perfectly well-to-do, and, in a measure, quite satisfied with the present conditions of their life. That is the first difficulty, and it is a very great difficulty.<lb/>
There is a second difficulty which pertains, not to the generality of the workers, but to those very workers whom we are here to-day to pity, and, if possible, to succour. It would be a cruel kindness if by any legislation to which your Lordships' House gave assent we were to add to the sufferings of these poor workers one further crushing disaster&#x2014;namely, to take away from them the only work they have. Therefore, we must walk very warily, and I confess I regretted the tone of confidence which I think, was the feature of the noble Lord's speech. He was only following the example of his chief. I noticed that the President of the Board of Trade, speaking in another place and upon another Bill&#x2014;the Labour Exchanges Bill&#x2014;sketched a picture of a sort of universal condition of Trade Boards. When he was advocating the necessary expense for the edifices under the Labour Exchanges Bill he spoke as though there would be a Trade Board meeting in every such building, which he put forward as a
<col>982</col>
reason for its existence. That may be, or may not be an ultimate development, but at the present moment the matter is only experimental, and I hope your Lordships will treat it as experimental. Whether hereafter this experimental may be a success, and whether your Lordship will agree under the provisions of the Bill to extend its operation to other trades, are matters into which we need not inquire at the present moment. Let us first see how this experiment succeeds before we cast our eyes further afield.<lb/>
I confess that I see no way out of the main proposition which the Government have put before your Lordships' House. As far as I myself am concerned, I assent to the establishment of these Trade Boards, whose principal function is to fix a minimum rate of wages. I do so because the ordinary trade remedy for these evils appears to be iinpracticable&#x2014;I mean the union of the workers. That is the proper remedy wherever it can be applied, and that is the remedy one would like to see applied in these cases. They know much better&#x2014;I am speaking of employer and employed&#x2014;what is good for them than any Trade Board which the ingenuity of the Government or of your Lordships' House can construct. But, unfortunately, the evidence is almost conclusive that these women have not made sufficient progress in the arts of citizenship to be able to combine in a trade union and until they do I presume we must be content with this procedure, not so good and not so effective as the other would have been.<lb/>
What are the main objects we have in view? About most of them I believe we shall all be agreed. In the first place, we want to secure for these sweated workers fair treatment&#x2014;that is to say, that it shall not be possible, if we can prevent it, that particular numbers of these poor workers should be worse treated than others in a like case and in like circumstances. As your Lordships know, there are good employers and bad employers, and the latter take advantage of the exigencies of the life of these individuals to treat them more harshly than the good employers would do. We desire, in the first place, to raise the level of these workers to the point which the workers have attained under good employers. That is the first point. There is another object, not certainly within our power, but which, if it were within our power, we should desire to attain&#x2014;namely,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0495"/>
<col>983</col>
that if the trade permits it the standard of remuneration of these poor workers should be raised all round. There was a considerable body of evidence given before the Select Committee to the effect that the competition between employers in these particular trades had driven down prices lower than they need be. If by our legislation and the establishment of these Trade Boards we can raise prices, because that is what it comes to, in such a way as to give greater remuneration to the workers without injuring the trade, that is another object which I think we should all desire to attain.<lb/>
I am afraid, however, there are some advocates of this legislation who go further than that. The Select Committee go further, because they view without repugnance the possibility that they may crush out certain trades in the process. I noticed with interest that the noble Lord just now repudiated that possibility. He said there was no chance of such a thing happening&#x2014;at least I understood him to say so. I am very glad to hear that that is not in the mind of the Government. I think it might be made clearer in the Bill. I say so because I, for one, could certainly not take any responsibility in crushing out these trades, which provide, it may be, the only work on which these unfortunate people have to live at all. The Report of the Select Committee laid down a sort of general proposition that, however much you increase the cost of production in these trades, you never crush them out. That is a very common thesis we often hear in these labour debates. We hear it with regard to hours. It is said that however much you shorten the hours of labour you never injure the trade. Why, you have only to state the proposition in that form to see its absurdity. There must be a limit. It may well be that there may be trades in which you cannot pile on the cost of production without injuring them, and I am glad to hear that His Majesty's Government do not desire to be parties to anything of the kind.<lb/>
The noble Lord said that one matter which gave him absolute confidence in approaching this subject was that all those who were interested were in favour of these Trade Boards. I am afraid the noble Lord has not read the whole of the evidence. I cannot pretend to have done so myself, but I have read a good deal, and I think it will he found that there were many witnesses drawn from amongst these unfortunate
<col>984</col>
women themselves who pleaded most urgently before the Select Committee that they should be left alone. After all, they were ignorant persons and may have made a mistake. But there were ladies who had taken special interest in this subject who urged upon the Committee the greatest caution in dealing with it. One, I remember, suggested that it was no kindness to take bad food away from a man unless you were prepared to provide him with better. That was a phrase which struck me as showing the point of view from which she regarded this legislation. I am not saying that this legislation is a mistake, but I do controvert the confidence of the noble Lord, and I do suggest to him that if his Bill is not quite clear in its object of not injuring any of these trades it should be amended to make it clear. Although I have ventured to criticise one or two paragraphs to be found in the Report of the Select Committee, there was much in it, of course, of which all of us can heartily approve, and I think in many respects the Committee in their Report were more cautious in dealing with this subject than the Bill of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
I would like to call the attention of the noble Lord to certain differences between the recommendations of the Select Committee and the proposals of His Majesty's Government. In the first place, the Committee proposed, as I understand, not altogether to apply the procedure to the same trades; the scope of the Government Bill is rather larger than the scope of the Select Committee's Report. Then there is a considerable difference in the constitution of the Trade Boards as between these two great authorities. The Trade Board of the Government is, as I understand, a central Board&#x2014;that is to say, for every particular trade there is to be one particular Trade Board for the whole of England. Take, for instance, the tailoring trade. Is there to be one Board for the whole of England or are there to be Boards in every district? I understand that the Government propose that for each of these trades there is to be a single Board. It is quite clear, whatever the Government intend, that the Select Committee intended something very different. They intended local Trade Boards&#x2014;Trade Boards for the different parts of the country even in the same trade. The Government propose an official element upon the Trade Board. The Select Committee propose no official element, unless it be the chairman, and they suggest
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0496"/>
<col>985</col>
that the chairman should be, in the first instance, appointed by the other members of the Board and only appointed by the Government in case they could not agree. I noticed that the noble Lord spoke of a small official element, but the only limit, as far as the Bill is concerned, is that the officials should not outnumber the representatives. I do not criticise the official element, but I should like to have heard it defended by the noble Lord. I do not gather that the piece rate which the noble Lord proposes is the same as the piece rate of the Select Committee&#x2014;that is to say, that it is to correspond to a time rate exactly. The piece rate is the time rate in which the ordinary worker can do the work. Is that so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02306"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: That is so in cases where the employer fixes his own piece rate in the absence of a piece rate fixed by the Trade Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02307"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I think that is a very important provision, because it is evident that under a bare time rate or under a piece rate which had no reference to time the old and infirm worker, who works much more slowly than the more healthy and vigorous worker, would be placed at a very great disadvantage. I have shown that there are certain differences or apparent differences between the Report of the Select Committee and the Bill of His Majesty's Government, and I think that the Select Committee are, on the whole, more careful of the interests of the home workers than are the Government, but I think both might have carried their precautions a little further. After all, in what are we mainly interested in this Bill? We are mainly interested in defending the interests of these sweated home workers. Be careful lest we allow the home workers and their influence to be overwhelmed by the superior organisation and the superior influence of the factory workers. That appears to be a matter of the first importance. The Government hardly propose any representation of the home workers at all. They have certain representation of workers generally; they have a sort of pious direction to the Board of Trade, who make the regulations, that they are to have regard in forming the Trade Boards to the representation of home workers; but there is no definite provision under which the home workers must be represented. I hope your Lord-
<col>986</col>
ships will realise that the interests of home workers and the interests of factory workers are not only not identical but are very often divergent and contradictory. It is evident that if the factory workers were asked to decide simply upon their own interests, it would be to their interests to raise wages until they had crushed the home worker out of existence.<lb/>
The home worker can only exist alongside the factory worker, if engaged in the same trade, if the home worker is willing to accept very much smaller remuneration. It is frequently the case that the factory worker and the home worker make the same article, and the home worker can only compete with the factory worker if a smaller remuneration is accepted. But the factory worker would desire to raise wages until the home worker must go under, and therefore it seems to me of the very essence of this remedial legislation that the interests of the home workers should be specially protected, and that they should not be merged with factory workers but should be treated on a different footing, and, if possible, by different organisations. If you combine this want of direct and definite representation of the home workers with the institution of these large central Boards, I put it to your Lordships how far you think the interests of the home workers will be represented? Is it at all likely that a central Board sitting in London, with, perhaps, one home worker upon it, will efficiently represent the interests of the home workers up and down the country? Is it not almost certain that the superior organisation of the factory workers and the official element and all the other parts of the Trade Board will overwhelm the interests of the home workers and that they will go by the board? I cannot say how surprised I am that the Government have not provided that there should be separate Trade Boards for home work and for factory work. I do not understand why that very obvious solution of the difficulty did not occur to them. Why is it necessary to treat the two on the same footing?<lb/>
There is one other matter, and one other matter only, to which I propose to refer, and it is similarly with the object of, as far as possible, protecting the interests of home workers. This Bill, like all the Bills now proposed to Parliament, is largely to be carried into effect by regulations. I do not know what those regulations are to be.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0497"/>
<col>987</col>
The noble Lord gave us no indication of what they are to be; but as soon as this Bill becomes law it is out of your hands, and your Lordships will have no control over the regulations. It is not even provided that they should be laid before Parliament. I hope the Government will see the desirability of accepting an Amendment to provide that the regulations shall be laid before Parliament for a certain number of days before coming into effect, and that they should only come into effect if not objected to. If these objections could be met, I think the Bill would be a much more satisfactory measure. I hope the Government will understand that the criticisms which I have ventured to make upon the proposals now before us have not been made in any spirit of hostility to the Bill or to the efforts of His Majesty's Government to deal with this great evil, but with a view to making the Bill effective, and I do not believe it will be effective without some such changes as those to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02308"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a very happy thing that after so long an interval of years as has elapsed since your Lordships' Committee on Sweating presented its Report we have at last this measure proposed to us. It is even happier that it comes to us with an accord between men of different views which was very amply and generously shown in another place and which the noble Marquess who has just sat down, in the very thoughtful and critical speech which he addressed to us, has not himself desired to disturb. It is not, of course, that there is not a very strong case against legislation of this kind. There is a very strong case against any attempt to interfere with the freedom with which labour and employment on their respective sides adjust themselves to one another; but the point surely is that that case, strong as it is, has been overborne in this instance and plainly overborne, not so much by logic and theory as by irrefutable facts. It is pathetic to observe what an immense amount of fact, involving human suffering and distress, has to accumulate before we at length arrive at the happy day when the evil can be dealt with and relief given. But in this case that day has certainly arrived, and I think one may say that it is, in fact, overdue.<lb/>
As the noble Marquess has put it with
<col>988</col>
the greatest clearness, we ought not to interfere if labour could provide its own remedy. Over large tracts of national industry labour has provided its own remedy by the method, at one time severely criticised, of a standard or minimum wage; but there remains an immense area&#x2014;I will not attempt to quarrel with the noble Marquess in his superior knowledge about the exact extent of that area&#x2014;in which it is impossible that organisation can bring a remedy. We know that attempts have been made again and again to organise some of these branches of labour, but it has not been found possible. Within my own diocese there are great masses of such workers with regard to whom it may be said that interference is their only chance of freedom. These people cannot get any effective freedom unless you come to their rescue; and to resist that is not real loyalty to the principle of free contract, but an obstinacy which refuses to see where a principle is limited by other considerations. It is satisfactory to find that that obstinacy does not characterise at this stage of the matter either or any of the great bodies of political opinion.<lb/>
We cannot approach a matter of this kind without remembering that we are taking a step in advance, and though one of the defenders of the measure in another place used rather strong language about the revolutionary character of the Bill, I cannot help feeling that the Bill only does in a new way what has been done in past times in a number of Statutes, which were met by the same argument&#x2014;that it would crush trades out of existence. The argument that it is better to give people bad food than no food, and arguments of that kind, no doubt have their weight, but they are not new arguments. <i>Hansard</i> would supply a good many instances of their use in past times. Parenthetically I should say myself that if there is any risk in certain cases of crushing very poorly-paid trades out of existence, it is a risk which at a certain stage ought to be run.<lb/>
The former steps that have been taken in legislation have had the effect of lifting us as a community a step in civilisation. There can be no doubt that if we look at the general state of the population compared with what it was before the Statutes dealing with truck, with women's labour, and similar subjects were passed, it will be seen that we have gone up a step in civilisation, but there remains in a large part of
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0498"/>
<col>989</col>
the industrial world a social condition which is barbarous in its effect upon those employed. Innumerable citizens are living under conditions of overstrain which break them down early and give them no opportunity and no strength for any of the things which make life tolerable or pleasant. These conditions of employment are barbarous in their effect on homes, on women's lives, and especially on child life. The worst of it is that when you look into this matter you find that there are really depths below depths. Seven shillings a' week seems a low wage when labour begins at 6 A.M. and ends only at 10 P.M. each day, but if you turn to the evidence available you find cases where the wage is only half that sum. You find sixpence a dozen paid for shirts and you think that pretty bad, but you find that from sixpence a dozen there are large deductions made.<lb/>
I think the noble Marquess has cut much too sharp a distinction between the factory and the home-worker. You have a state of things in factories&#x2014;that is my experience in South London&#x2014;which is quite deplorable in this way, that the workers are powerless to resist any pressure with regard to wages put upon them. The noble Marquess has told us that home-workers are in a far more parlous state still. Strong economic pressure is not really the only force; there is an element of caprice and uncertainty due to the fact that one side in the bargain has no power to keep things steady, and certainly in parts the very low wages tend to go lower still. One of the most deplorable features in these cases is that of the imposition of fines, sometimes reckoned in pounds, upon workers whose wages are reckoned in pence. When these things are stated it must be admitted that we owe a remedy to these people. We must not hesitate longer in extending simple justice. But that is not all. We owe a remedy to ourselves, for I believe that in more ways than could be easily compressed into any statement this is one of the open sores of our social life through which the strength and vitality of the community run away. I believe that as a community we owe it to ourselves to provide some remedy, and if by doing so we help the workers, assuredly we shall help quite as much the whole social and industrial life of the country. I feel constrained to say that the whole problem of unemployment&#x2014;it ought to be a platitude and I hope it is&#x2014;is becoming one of
<col>990</col>
such deepening anxiety that the attention of the whole community ought to be riveted upon it to a greater extent than unhappily is the case, in spite of Royal Commissions and their sad Reports; and I think it will be found that it is the classes of labour which are unorganised and unprotected by legislation that make the greatest contributions to that problem of unemployment. We owe this remedy, not only to ourselves, but to other nations too, because a great deal of the work produced under these conditions goes out of the country. What does that mean? It means that it goes out of the country to come into competition with the work produced by other countries, and therefore if the rate of wages in those countries should be more satisfactory than it is here, if the condition of the people there should be less degraded, we by our present conduct are actively helping to lower the social standard there and to do harm to the working classes of those countries.<lb/>
It is a very pleasant feature in the case that we are applying a remedy which is not only beneficial to ourselves and to other countries but beneficial to the employers too, at any rate to those whom we want to consider. In the Report of the recent Committee on Home Work, upon which employers sat, it was unanimously agreed that you must touch wages, and that you can only touch wages by Trade Boards. Therefore I venture to think we ought not to hesitate at all about this remedy. It is on a very small scale. I hope that no attempt will be made to whittle away any part of the very small measure of relief which this Bill contains. It is confined at present to certain trades. I hope that His Majesty's Government will resist&#x2014;I trust they will have no occasion to resist&#x2014;any attempt to withdraw the power given in the Bill enabling protection to be extended, under the most careful safeguards, to other trades which I do not think we can doubt for an instant need such relief as much, or nearly as much, as those contained in the Schedule. We have been some time in coming to this matter. Now that we have come to it, let us be very careful to see that we do not give occasion for attack by pushing it further than it ought to go. On the other hand, we should not be so timid about risks as to whittle away and make ineffective a measure which contains a solid experiment in the right direction, and from the results of which we
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0499"/>
<col>991</col>
hope that great benefits will come to those whom we seek to touch. I trust also that we shall be guided to go quietly and steadily forward in whatever further legislation the same kind of circumstances may require.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02309"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to ask your Lordships to listen to any lengthy remarks from me on this Bill, but there was one observation made by the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, which I think does need a word of comment. The noble Marquess said it was a self-evident proposition that home workers must be paid less than factory workers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02310"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that home workers must necessarily be paid worse than factory workers unless they were engaged in producing the same article.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02311"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess's proposition is that home workers must be paid less than factory workers if they are making the same article. I should have thought that precisely the opposite was obvious, because the home worker provides his own workroom and light, and, to some extent, his own materials. Therefore in the nature of things there does not appear to be any reason in the world why&#x2014;though unhappily frequently the case&#x2014;the home worker should be paid less than the factory worker for exactly the same article.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02312"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It is not that the home worker is paid less for the same article but paid less on the whole, because he or she makes fewer of the same article. That is where the difference comes in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02313"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that even then the noble Marquess's argument applies. The noble Marquess asked the Government to, as it were, intensify the distinction between the home worker and the factory worker and to have different Boards for the two sets of workers. A great many of us who have been very much interested in this subject for a number of years, so far from desiring that, think that nothing more disastrous could be done with regard to the economic condition of the sweated worker, and that the thing most to be desired is
<col>992</col>
that you should bring the home worker and the factory worker under the operation of the same laws and the same requirements as to the conditions of their work. There is no economic reason in the nature of the case why that should not be. The bad employers feel that they have the home worker much more in their grasp; and the whole object of this legislation is to enable just that class of worker who is most powerless because weak and unorganised to get some measure of the benefits which more capable workers have been able to secure through organisation.<lb/>
I was glad to hear the noble Marquess speak with such enthusiasm of the work of the trade unions. With that I would desire to associate myself; but the object of this legislation is to enable those who cannot organise themselves to obtain some measure of the advantage of organisation; and I am quite sure that His Majesty's Government are right in believing that what they have to do is not to dissociate the home workers from the factory workers but to bring them more and more into the same category and under the operation of the same laws. Therefore I earnestly hope that the noble Marquess will not do anything in the direction of setting up a distinct Board or a distinct mode of treatment for home workers. Nor do I believe there is any kind of economic necessity or justification for such separate treatment. I believe the Bill will strengthen the hands of the best class of employers against the competition of bad employers. I do not think there is any other department of our industrial life in which there appears to be so marked a difference between the bad employer and the good employer, and I do believe that one of the most conspicuous effects of the Trade Boards Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be to help the good employers to contend against the competition of the bad employers. I do not doubt that there is a certain measure of experiment in this, as in almost all other kinds of legislation. I believe that those of us who are most interested in the institution of these Trade Boards and believe most in the principle would be very glad if the experiment could have been made at some time when trade was more obviously on the rise. We are a little anxious about the moment when the experiment is tried; but it seems to me that His Majesty's Government have designed it in a form as moderate and as restricted as possible, and I do most earnestly hope that
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0500"/>
<col>993</col>
nothing will be done in this House which will in any way weaken the force of this moderate Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02314"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a member of the Anti-Sweating League, which has for many years advocated the establishment of wages boards in this country, I desire to express my satisfaction at the introduction of this Bill and at the reception which it has received in your Lordships' House. I feel profoundly grateful that something is at last to be done for a class of people who are singularly deserving of the assistance of Parliament, and who are, by the nature of their circumstances, utterly incapable of helping themselves.<lb/>
It was nineteen years ago that a Committee of this House, presided over by Lord Dunraven, first investigated the whole matter of sweating, and issued a Report which opened the eyes of a great many people to an evil of which they were up to then largely ignorant. Eighteen years went by, and nothing was done for the people who came before Lord Dunraven's Committee and explained the circumstances of their lives. Last year another Parliamentary Committee was appointed by the other House&#x2014;the Committee on Home Work, presided over by Sir Thomas Whittaker. Again the same story was told, in some cases by the very same people, of the existence of this evil, which had been going on all these years. The circumstances of their lives had not been affected except by the natural order of events, which tended still further to lower the wages which they received. Now at last we have definite action on the matter taken by Parliament, and I say I am profoundly grateful that we have arrived at that day at last.<lb/>
It is not necessary, I think, in order to defend this Bill, to dwell at all on the pathetic side of the lives of these sweated workers. I do not propose to bring forward any facts showing the low wages which they receive and the hardships of their existence, because I do not think there is any need, in this House, at any rate, to stir up sympathy for this class of people. I do not suppose there is a single member of this House who would not be anxious and willing to put an end to the evil if he clearly saw his way to do it. Everyone who has spoken up to the present has expressed sympathy for the sweated workers. But
<col>994</col>
there is another set of facts which I think deserves to be mentioned, because these facts supply at once the justification for the Bill and the best hope that it will prove a success. I refer to the facts which show the variations in the payments that are made to different workers in the sweated industries. The subject was referred to by the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, and it is really the very root of the whole matter and the whole case for the Bill. It is the fact that in all these industries which we describe as sweated industries, whereas some of the workers are receiving wages which amount to perhaps a penny or two-pence an hour, and from five to six or seven shillings a week, other workers engaged in the same trade, making precisely the same articles under precisely the same conditions, but for different employers, are receiving wages twice and three times that amount.<lb/>
I could quote examples illustrating what I mean. There was an inquiry held recently in Glasgow into the circumstances of some of the trades them and there was shown to exist in the clothing trade a difference of fifty per cent, between the wages paid by the best employers and those paid by other employers. At Cradley Heath, among the chain-makers, there is an instance of the difference between the wages paid to factory and home workers. Some workers engaged in factories were receiving three times as much wages as home workers. Again, at Whitechapel a firm pays sixteen shillings a week to its tea packers, whilst another firm only pays seven shillings and sixpence to the same class of people. Lastly, I would give an instance not merely of different rates of wages in the same district but of different rates of wages paid in the same firm. In a shirt factory in the East-end in which women worked upon the same shirts, cut by the same people from the same bale of material, there was a difference in wages of between forty-five and fifty per cent., the point being that in these industries where there is no mobility of labour and no organisation there is no uniformity in payment. The whole trouble is that owing to lack of organisation on the part of the workpeople, the good employers are constantly being under-cut by the bad employers and wages are consequently dragged down from the level which good employers could well afford and would be willing to pay if they were left to themselves.<lb/>
The remedy for this state of affairs is not
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0501"/>
<col>995</col>
so much a general rise in wages throughout the trade as to establish uniformity in the rates of payment and to secure that all workers doing under the same conditions the same kind of work shall receive the rate of wages which it is possible for the good employer in that trade to pay them. That is what this Bill aims at doing. The real object of the Bill is to enlarge the wage-fixing unit from the single individual to the single trade, and to secure by an artificial machinery that once a rate of wages is determined as fair to the workers and to the employers that shall be the minimum which shall prevail in the whole trade. I maintain that, though novel, this legislation is neither vicious in principle nor revolutionary in practice. It must, of course, as the noble Marquess who sits on the Front Opposition Bench said, be approached with great care and caution. There are obvious objections to be seen in legislation of this kind, but, from the economic point of view, I believe that the main effect of the Bill will be to provide artificially in these parasitic trades the same kind of organisation for collective bargaining as already exists in the larger and healthier trades by natural process.<lb/>
The noble Marquess expressed a fear that by this legislation we might be adding still further to the burdens of these sweated home workers, and he said that the Bill must be very carefully scrutinised from that point of view. If I shared his fears on that point I should be very reluctant to see this Bill pass into law, but I think that, if the machinery which is set up by the Bill is closely examined, it will be found that there are a number of provisions which have been inserted with the express object of protecting the unskilled worker. In the first place there is the minimum time rate established by Clause 4, but which is to be fixed not only for different trades but even for different branches of the same trade, as it may happen that one branch of a trade may be sweated, whereas the trade as a whole may not be sweated. It is further laid down that the minimum time rate may be fixed for different classes of workers. That is in order to secure a distinction between those who are beginners in their trade and those who are skilled and expert. Again, there is a distinction made between home workers and factory workers, and different rates may be fixed for those who work in their own homes and those who work in factories. Lastly there is a differentiation between the
<col>996</col>
different processes of the same industry, so that a different rate of wages may be fixed for processes like finishing in the tailoring trade. In this way there is great elasticity in the time rate in order to meet the interests of different classes. The home worker, as a rule, will do his work on a piece rate and not on a time rate. The piece rate again is divided into a general piece rate which will be fixed by the sub-committee of the Trade Board for articles of uniform shape and size, and the special piece rate which any employer can, on application, get fixed for his own workers.<lb/>
There is another matter which ought to be mentioned. Subsection (3) of Clause 6 provides that if a Trade Board are satisfied that any worker employed on time work in any branch of a trade to which a minimum time rate fixed by the Trade Board is applicable, is affected by any infirmity or physical injury which renders him incapable of earning that minimum time rate, and are of opinion that the case cannot suitably be met by employing the worker on piece-work, the Trade Board may sanction a special rate being fixed in this special case. I imagine that this power would be rarely used, but it is inserted in case there may be any worker or class of worker who, owing to the operation of the minimum rate of wages, might be crushed out of employment. From an economic point of view this elasticity in the machinery gives us considerable safeguards against the possibility of workers being deprived, as the noble Marquess said, of that small amount of work which they are able to do, and their lot being made still worse than it has been hitherto.<lb/>
The experience in the healthy trades in which organisations of this kind have sprung up voluntarily rather justifies us in believing that the same result will take place when these Trade Boards are established. In industries like the cotton industry, where the rate of wages has gone up as the result of the collective bargaining of the workers and the employers, instead of the price of the finished article being increased, exactly the opposite has taken place. It is not a necessary consequence that an increase in the rate of wages should be followed by an increase in the price of the finished article. I admit that there is all the difference in the world, politically speaking, between voluntary machinery of the kind I have mentioned and com-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0502"/>
<col>997</col>
pulsory machinery such as that set up in this Bill, but from an economic point of view the result is the same. The Rill has been received with some apprehension from a political point of view, on the ground that new authorities are being set up with new powers which are in themselves unusual and strange, and which are, perhaps, capable of extension in directions which may not at present be foreseen; but I would point out that these new powers set up in the Bill are safeguarded by a very large number of provisions and restricted in various directions.<lb/>
In the first place, the Bill is only to apply to those trades which are mentioned in the Schedule, and any extension to other trades can only take place with full Parliamentary control by the Provisional Order machinery. Therefore Parliaments of the future will have the matter of the extension of the machinery of this Bill entirely within their control. Then the Trade Boards themselves will be composed of workers and employers in an equal proportion, with a certain number of expert official members to guide their deliberations; and I think we may feel sure that a body so formed, on which all those who are interested in the trade from any point of view are represented, will not be likely to do anything which would damage the trade from a business point of view. Then there is the tentative way in which the whole process is established. Every effort is to be made to try and bring about the establishment of these Boards by voluntary process. In addition to the general Trade Boards for the whole country there will be district trade committees, on whom will devolve the duty of making inquiries and recommending the minimum rate of wages suitable for particular trades; and when the minimum rate is promulgated there will be a probationary period of six months during which opportunity will be given to those engaged in the trade to make use of the machinery of their own accord, and it will only be after the lapse of this time and when there is ample force behind it that the minimum rate will be made obligatory.<lb/>
Throughout the whole of the proceedings there is the Board of Trade perpetually in the background to safeguard the interests of each particular trade. Its sanction is necessary to every minimum rate of wages which may be fixed; and there is this further
<col>998</col>
provision in subsection (4) of Clause 4, that if by any chance, owing to some interest not being fully represented on the Trade Board, the rate of wages may be fixed higher than would have been the case if the employers were bargaining with a representative body of workmen, power is reserved to the Board of Trade in those circumstances to alter and reduce the rate fixed. There is one other matter with regard to the home worker to which I wish to refer. I suppose the noble Marquess, who felt that home workers were not going to receive sufficient representation on these bodies, has noticed that in subsection (3) of Clause 11, which deals with the regulations under which the elections to these Boards will take place, there is a provision that in framing the regulations regard should be had to the desirability of the representation of home workers on the Trade Boards.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02316"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: The machinery for the election of these Boards will be entirely in the hands of the Board of Trade and will be matter for regulation; but, as far as the Bill gives us any indication it is obvious that due regard will be had to the circumstances of home workers. In legislation of this kind, which is new to this country, it is of some value, I think, to see what has been the experience of other countries where similar legislation has been attempted. We have no experience to guide us in Europe. As the noble Lord in charge of the Bill said, we are leading the way in this matter. But when we turn to the Colony of Victoria, where these Wages Boards have been established, there is a great deal in their experience which leads us to hope that this legislation will be successful in this country. Wages Boards were established in Victoria in 1896, and were made applicable to six trades only as an experiment; but in 1903 they were held to have justified their existence, and were made by law part of the permanent machinery of trade. It is an interesting fact that half the total number of Wages Boards which have been established in that Colony have been set up at the instance of the employers themselves; and the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria has asserted that sweating has been practically extinguished in many trades and industrial disputes have practically ceased, only one strike
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0503"/>
<col>999</col>
having taken place since the establishment of the Boards, and that of very short duration. We have already some indication in this country that our experience will be of a similar kind, because, with regard to the trades already included in the Schedule the majority of the employers in those trades have expressed their appreciation and approval of the Bill.<lb/>
I hope that the noble Marquess will not accuse me of over-confidence if I say that these facts are a happy augury for legislation of this kind, and if I also assert that in the safeguards and elasticity of the machinery of the Bill we have security against its abuse or failure. There is no doubt that the legislation is an experiment and a new departure; but I assert that the evils with which the Bill is intended to deal are sufficient to justify experimental legislation. We must remember that we are dealing with a class of people who, from the very nature of their circumstances, are utterly without the means of supplying the necessary organisation themselves and coming to their own assistance; we are dealing with a class of people in whose lives there is going on the fiercest possible struggle for existence; they are people who are dumbly unhappy all the time, and it is because they are inarticulate and unable to voice their grievances that Parliament has for so many years refrained from taking up their case. It is because I believe that this Bill will go a long way to improve their conditions and to make their existence a little easier that I welcome its introduction by the Government and hope that your Lordships' House will pass it into law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02317"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that I should be lacking in Parliamentary courtesy if I did not take this opportunity of saying at any rate a few words by way of expressing my satisfaction at the introduction of this Bill. I feel under this obligation because during the course of the autumn session I put the noble Earl the Leader of the House to the trouble of a short discussion and pressed him for an answer as to the intentions of the Government. He was not able to give me that answer at the time, but my satisfaction is none the less having seen that the hopes which I entertained have been fulfilled.<lb/>
I range myself in my approval of this Bill with the noble Earl who has just
<col>1000</col>
spoken, and I do most heartily and sincerely congratulate His Majesty's Government on the action they have taken. In spite of the attractions and the distractions of their enormous programme of legislation, they have dealt promptly with the Report of the Committee which inquired into this question. What they have done is to take definite action. They have moved from the position of inaction which, in my humble judgment, has been an absolute disgrace to the Parliament and Government of this country for so many years. It was twenty years ago that this question was fully investigated and reported upon. I believe that all the recommendations of the Committee of that time were carried out; yet the evils of sweating have continued, I will not say in an undiminished degree, but still in such a degree that a further inquiry has been necessary, an inquiry which has resulted in very prompt action.<lb/>
What I cannot understand about this question is that the national conscience, which is so easily aroused in regard to delinquencies amongst other peoples or oppression or hardship in other countries, has not been aroused in regard to this terrible evil which has existed so long in our midst. If everything that had been said on political platforms in regard to "Chinese slavery" in South Africa had been true and justified, I do not think that the suffering could compare with that of the sweated workers; and, similarly, it would not be difficult to multiply instances in which popular indignation has driven Parliament to action in this country on account of human misery which certainly did not exceed, if it equalled, that of our own fellow countrymen and fellow countrywomen who are suffering from the evils of sweating. In these circumstances I cannot understand how anybody can for one moment question the propriety of interference, how anybody can stop to consider the bearing of economic theory in regard to this question. The evils of sweating are there. They are, without doubt and beyond question, a blot on our civilisation and a denial of that humanity of which we make so much boast. That being so, surely we ought not to be deterred by any theory from adopting that which appears to be an effective remedy.<lb/>
The Government have taken steps to remove the disgrace of leaving the matter alone, and we may be thankful to them.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0504"/>
<col>1001</col>
I venture to think the step they have taken is a step in the right direction, but I feel that it is a very small step. I should have liked them to go further. The Secretary to the Board of Trade in another place described this Bill as a "revolution," and the phrase has evidently impressed all those who have spoken this evening. I think that was hyperbolic language hardly warranted even by the pardonable pride of one who is comparatively new to office. There is absolutely nothing that is revolutionary in this Bill. There is nothing that is inconsistent with the principles which have underlain all our social reform and the factory legislation of the last fifty or sixty years. The right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Southwark even seemed to be among those who regard it as a dangerous or an anxious innovation to interfere between capital and labour, and who regard this as the first occasion on which the State has interfered to regulate wages. I take a different view. I hold that the very first of the long series of Acts for social reform, the Truck Act, was an Act which interfered to regulate wages, and in the latest of the series&#x2014;the Eight Hours Act&#x2014;there is no question whatever that the action of Parliament has interfered between the employer and the workman in the matter of payment. Then, again, there has been interference in regard to the remuneration of labour in the administrative acts of Government Departments themselves&#x2014;a fact which is, of course, familiar to everybody.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, in these circumstances it is impossible to regard this Bill as a revolution. It is an experiment, and I venture to think that it is not a large experiment. I think that the Government might have done more while they were about it. There is no question as to the evil and its causes, but His Majesty's Government have only touched half the question. It is no use whatever to tell the British employer that he must observe a minimum rate of wages unless you tell the foreign employer that he must do the same; otherwise it follows that you are handing over the trades concerned to foreign sweated labour. While you rescue the unfortunate victims of sweating from one form of starvation, you hand them over to another which is, perhaps, worse. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill tried to anticipate this objection. His argument was that legislation in regard to sweating
<col>1002</col>
is being considered in other countries and that we can safely assume that they will follow our lead and legislate on similar lines. I need only remind the noble Lord that similar anticipations in regard to the great economic creed, of which, no doubt, he is a devoted adherent&#x2014;the creed of Free Trade&#x2014;were put forward to justify its introduction, but those expectations have not been fulfilled, and I see no reasons why foreign countries should follow our lead in this smaller respect any more than in the matter of Free Trade.<lb/>
I think that the Government, in spite of their obstinate adherence to the dogmas of Free Trade, might very well, without any discredit to themselves or any objection from their supporters, have taken yet one more step in the direction which has been indicated to them by their own Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;in the direction of common sense. I am referring to that which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has done in regard to the Patents Act, and the Merchant Shipping Act. In a very remarkable skit by a French writer, called <i>L' Ile de Pinoguin</i>, there is a story of a millionaire which impressed me very much. With this millionaire the habit of accumulating had become so strong that he sacrificed everything to it. He led the life of a pauper, and no consideration whatever would induce him to give anything. His workmen were sweated and oppressed, and at last one of them, in desperation, gained access to the room of the millionaire who was lying on a sickbed and threatened him with a revolver. The millionaire was staunch to his principles. Rather than give this man a rise of wages and so abandon his principles he allowed himself to be shot. He was a martyr to his principles. His Majesty's Government adhere with similar obstinacy to the dogmas of Free Trade, but they let others be martyrs on their behalf. They are not suffering themselves from this obstinate adherence to principle. It seems to me that such bigotry is a cold, cruel, callous, cynical conception of Cobdenism, which the warm-hearted author of that creed would have indignantly repudiated himself, and I do think that His Majesty's Government might have made some provision for protecting the victims of sweating from the new danger of foreign competition. We must be content for the present with what we have got, and it will be left to a Unionist Government and to Tariff Reform to apply the real and the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0505"/>
<col>1003</col>
final remedy for this evil. As regards the machinery of the Bill, I have no cause for complaint or for criticism. I think it is, on the whole, satisfactory. There are one or two small points on which I think it might, with advantage be brushed up, but I do not share in all the larger apprehensions which have been expressed this evening. Apart from my regret that the Bill has not gone further, I am sincerely gratified that His Majesty's Government have taken steps to meet this evil.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02318"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not occupy your Lordships' time for more than a few minutes, but I wish to call attention to one matter. In my opinion the notice to be given to a trader who may hereafter be taken under the wing, so to speak, of the Board of Trade, is not sufficiently long. I think this is a good Bill, though it is of a grandmotherly type. The difficulty seems to me to lie in one direction&#x2014;namely, the question of the wages to be paid. I think every man in a trade would like to pay good wages if he could afford to do so, but if he has to pay wages that are fixed at too high a figure his business ceases and there are more unemployed than formerly. It must be remembered that we have to compete with traders in particular trades all over the world, and when wages are increased to too high a figure the men in those trades cannot compete with the foreigner and they have to go out of the trade altogether. The Board of Trade in past years have conducted their different negotiations with great success. They have had great difficulties to face, and in facing them have shown tact, moderation, and, I would say, equity.<lb/>
My sole reason for rising is to refer to the matter of notice When this Bill was first introduced in the other House four trades were scheduled, but power was taken to schedule any other trade that did not appear to the Board of Trade to conform to certain regulations with regard to wages. In the event of another trade being taken under the wing of the Board of Trade an Order had to lie on the Table of both Houses for thirty days. No other provision was made by means of which notification should be given to the trader that his trade was to be attacked, but when the Bill went to the Grand Committee of the other House a change was made, and instead of the Order lying for thirty days on the Table of Parliament it was provided that this should be done by Provisional Order, which, of course,
<col>1004</col>
could not be acted upon until confirmed by Parliament. I had the advantage of communication with an official of the Board of Trade, and he was good enough to point out to me this fact regarding the Provisional Order and I expressed my satisfaction at the time. I hope he will excuse me for having changed my opinion. I do not think a Provisional Order is sufficient notice to a trader who is, so to speak, to be attacked. It is a matter of great moment to a trader to know what is proposed to be done, and I do not think there would be any objection to reasonable notice. I would, therefore, suggest to the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that when any fresh trade is added to those already dealt with in the Schedule twenty-one days' notice should be given by advertisement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02319"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend behind me gave so clear and full an account of the provisions of this Bill that I need not attempt to go over any of the same ground, and I think that my noble friend has no reason to complain of the reception which his Bill has met with at your Lordships' hands. Even the noble Marquess opposite, who is not now in his place, approved of the provisions of the Bill, generally speaking, although his approval was of a somewhat qualified kind. On the other hand, the two right rev. Prelates and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, all in very illuminating speeches, gave a distinctly fuller approval to the Bill, and the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, although he made one severe criticism on what he considered an important omission from the Bill, yet gave a meed of praise to our efforts which I am sure must have gladdened my noble friend behind me.<lb/>
It is perfectly true&#x2014;and in this I do not go so far as the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill&#x2014;that this Bill does involve a new departure in our legislation, and that departure is only in our minds justified because we regard it as a special remedy, almost of a surgical character, for a morbid condition of things attaching to certain particular trades. I do not know that any real fear has been expressed in this House, though it may have been elsewhere, that the provisions of the Bill are likely to be indiscriminately applied to other trades. The reason why they are not likely to be so applied seems to me to consist in the fact that these sweated
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0506"/>
<col>1005</col>
trades are in reality of a very marked character, a character different from the ordinary trades both in this country and other countries. All over the world in certain trades where the particular conditions exist such as exist in the four trades in the Schedule you will find the same evils and the same difficulties. These particular trades attract a special type of enfeebled worker, if I may say so, partly owing to the facility with which a great part of the work connected with them can be done at the workers' homes, and partly owing to the fact that the conditions of the trades render almost impossible those combinations which are the strength, as I am glad to think, of the greater number of trades both in this country and in other countries.<lb/>
The noble Marquess opposite, Lord Salisbury, made some observations upon the character of the Trade Boards that we set up under this Bill; and, in passing, I may say he quite unwittingly did an injustice to my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade with regard to an observation which the noble Marquess thought he had made as to the extension of Trade Boards. My right hon. friend, as I well know&#x2014;and I think he is perfectly right&#x2014;looks forward to an extension of Boards, either in connection with labour exchanges, or, possibly, in connection with some of the provisions of this Bill, not with a view of the fixing of minimum wages by such Boards, but with the idea that they may become friendly councils as between employers and employed, at which all manner of questions connected with particular trades can be discussed. It must not be taken that my right hon. friend's statement had anything to do with a general extension of the principle of fixing a minimum wage.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess spoke of the large number of official members on these Trade Boards, and he said, unless I am mistaken, that the only provision which safeguarded their numbers was that they should not exceed the number of unofficial members. There the noble Marquess is in error. If he will look at Clause 13, subsection (2), he will see that the official members must be less than half the number of unofficial members on the Board. Then the noble Marquess asked what purpose the official members would serve. I think it is clear that the existence of these official members must have a steadying effect and
<col>1006</col>
the effect of inducing similarity of treatment in the same trade over different parts of England. It would be, I think, a heavy burden on the employers and employed in some of these trades to set them to work without some assistance of the kind in regulating the difficult questions which may come before them; and for that reason I confess I think it is not difficult to defend the existence of the official element on the Trade Boards and also on the district committees.<lb/>
The noble Marquess expressed very keen anxiety for the interests of the home workers as distinct from and as being even more important than, those of the workers in factories. I think the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham gave a quite full and complete answer to the suggestion of the noble Marquess that it would be advisable to have separate Trade Boards for the two classes, because he was able to show that in reality, although the interests of the two classes may superficially in a particular case appear to be divergent, as a matter of fact they are, in the strictest sense, identical. The noble Marquess spoke of the helplessness of the home workers on these Boards, and seemed to think that the Board would be dominated by the representatives of those who work in factories. But the noble Marquess surely forgot this. The home workers have one very important set of people on their side&#x2014;namely, the employers. The existence of the class of home workers is obviously the greatest possible saving to the employer; he does not at all wish to crowd them out of existence in any way, because if the particular employer had to substitute factory workers for all the home workers who make the goods in which he deals he would have to supply factory room and machinery and very largely increase the amount of capital which he has invested in the business. Therefore it seems to me almost to be <i>ex hypothesi</i> that the interest of the home worker against that of the factory worker will in a great number of cases have the support of the employer on the Board.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess laid it down as an axiom, and expected general concurrence in the statement, that a rise in wages in any particular trade must necessarily lead to a rise in prices. In the days when we all learned political economy we were always told that high prices did not necessarily make high wages. The converse,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0507"/>
<col>1007</col>
I think, can be shown to be true in many instances, and in this particular case there are various reasons why the sort of rise in wages which is contemplated under this Bill need not necessarily lead to anything like a general rise in prices. In the first place, I think it cannot be disputed that in the case of these sweated home workers an increased wage will in many cases add to the actual efficiency of the individual. A great many of them are underfed and have not sufficient means of keeping their rooms warm, and it may be assumed, I think, that such extra wages as they may receive will be spent in a manner which may add to the individual efficiency of each. Then, in the second place&#x2014;this is the point which was mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and, of course, it is one of the most important considerations to be borne in mind in connection with the whole of the Bill&#x2014;there is the most astonishing divergence of wages paid by different employers in respect of the same work done; and the idea, therefore, is not so much to raise the standard of wage as to fix a minimum wage, raising the price paid by the bad employer to the level of that paid by the good employer. If that is so, the rise in price which would follow from a proceeding of that kind I should conceive to be very small indeed.<lb/>
There is also the fact that in a great many of these trades it is generally believed, and I think it is undoubtedly true, that the profits of the middleman are in certain cases far too large. Nobody knows what they are, but it is suspected that in many cases they could stand a great deal of reduction, and that, in other words, gives a certain fund from which a rise of wages in individual cases could be found without sending up prices. There is the further consideration, which, I think, was mentioned by the noble Marquess himself, that the tendency of these Boards certainly will be to lessen the cut-throat competition between different employers, which undoubtedly does something to keep wages down, and which we should like to see as far as possible done away with. I quite sympathise with the noble Marquess opposite in his anxiety for the interests of the home worker. We certainly do not wish to see such work improved out of existence altogether. On the other hand, it must be remembered that there may be cases of a sort of dreary acquiescence in their present deplorable conditions by individual
<col>1008</col>
home workers, who dread the idea of any change lest it should mean the loss of any work they have, but this cannot be allowed to override general considerations and the welfare of such workers as a class. I do not know that I should go quite so far as some speakers, because it is possible that in the case of certain actually moribund trades a few home workers still cling on at work which has, in the main, been transferred to factories because it is found it can be done there so much more cheaply. It may be that a few of these, so to speak, almost dead leaves remain on the tree working at a starvation wage, and I confess I do think it is possible, and I cannot pretend to regret it, that in some cases a complete euthanasia of such work may be accelerated by the passing of this Bill. But these are the only cases in which I think it can be said that any particular kind of work will be done away with by this legislation, and I repeat that I do not think that, in itself, can be considered a regrettable fact. I will even go so far as to say that even if some individuals lost a little work of that kind, from some points of view they would be better off in receipt of Poor Law relief.<lb/>
The only other point on which I wish to say a word or two is that which was dealt with by Lord Ampthill&#x2014;foreign competition. He seemed to assume that the result of this legislation might be that we should be flooded by foreign-made sweated goods, and the noble Lord, replying to my noble friend behind me who said that legislation similar to this was contemplated by several countries in Europe&#x2014;I believe my noble friend might have gone further and have said that such legislation actually exists in some eases&#x2014;said that because Mr. Cobden's supposed expectation that other countries would adopt Free Trade had not been fulfilled, my noble friend might be equally wrong. But, my Lords, the cases are not parallel, because we have no right, I think, to assume that foreign countries are behind ourselves, or likely to be behind ourselves, in legislation of this kind which exists on a humanitarian basis. Whether foreign countries were at any particular time likely to adopt a particular fiscal system is another matter, but I do not know what authority the noble Lord opposite can have for assuming that all countries on the Continent of Europe will necessarily lag behind us in promoting legislation of this kind. But
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0508"/>
<col>1009</col>
there are many other reasons why the noble Lord's point does not, I think, assume real importance. In the first place, I have given various reasons by which I have endeavoured to show that the general effect of this legislation need not be, and ought not to be, to raise to any serious extent prices in the trades concerned. The noble Lord must remember another thing&#x2014;that the principal trade affected here is an export trade. The ready-made clothing trade is one of the trades we hear so harshly spoken of by Tariff Reformers because it is supposed to be a low-class trade, and our exports in that trade are considered&#x2014;I cannot understand why&#x2014;to be inferior in value to other exports which produce the same amount. This is an export trade and is therefore free from foreign competition. It would take a great deal, so long as we go on exporting&#x00A3;2,000,000 worth or more of ready-made clothing, to bring prices into such a condition that we should be likely to be importing ready-made clothing. Consequently the fears of the noble Lord in that respect are, I think, somewhat baseless.<lb/>
The noble Marquess opposite asked a question regarding the laying of the regulations on the Table. I should have thought myself that the specific regulations dealing with different trades and different branches of trade would have been of so technical a character that it would not have been of very great service to lay them before Parliament, but I have no doubt that my right hon. friend will take the noble Marquess's request into consideration. I have nothing more to add except to express once more the satisfaction with which I have regarded this debate. The Bill has been very fairly and even generously spoken of by all those who have taken part in the debate, and I hope that I may not incur the censure of the noble Marquess and be thought, like my noble friend behind me, to be too sanguine if I say that, in spite of the limitations which attach to all social legislation of this kind, which we know cannot create a new heaven and a new earth, yet I venture to express the hope that some very genuine amelioration of the lot of these poor people, in some ways, perhaps, the most helpless class of any in this country, may be effected by the Bill which my noble friend has introduced.</membercontribution></p>

Lords, I feel so strongly the great importance of the new departure which this Bill involves that I am tempted to say a few words before the discussion closes. But let me, at the outset, explain that I have no intention of marring the harmonious reception which the Bill has met with from both sides of the House. If we were called upon to vote aye or no upon the Second Reading of this Bill, I should unhesitatingly vote in favour of the Second Reading, and I go further and say that I should regret to see any amendment introduced into it which might have the effect of impairing its efficiency.<lb/>
There are, I suppose, two questions which present themselves to us this evening&#x2014;first, are the evils of that which we commonly speak of as the sweating system so great as to require treatment by legislation; and, secondly, is the particular remedy proposed in this Bill the remedy most appropriate to the case? The first question we can only answer in the affirmative. I think it is just that the public should be reminded that it was in this House twenty years ago that a Member of it&#x2014;Lord Dunraven&#x2014;first called attention to this matter. The report of his Committee, although it led to no result at the time, is referred to by the recent Committee as one of the most important documents which came before them. That, I think, is sufficient to show that we in this House have never been indifferent to the importance of the question.<lb/>
When we come to the question of the particular remedy recommended to us by His Majesty's Government there is, I think, rather more to be said. It is a very novel and very drastic remedy, and a remedy which I am glad to think His Majesty's Government intend to apply with very great caution. The noble Lord who introduced the Bill endeavoured to disarm criticisms of that kind by reminding us that it was by no means an unusual thing for the State to interfere between employer and employed. That is quite true, and if I regard this particular proposal with a certain amount of anxiety, which I cannot entirely divest my mind of, it is not because it implies the interference of the State between the employer and the employed, but because it introduces a new kind of interference. The noble Lord, in his opening speech, reminded us that we have had cases where the hours of employment have been interfered with,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0509"/>
<col>1011</col>
and where sanitary conditions have been imposed upon employers of labour. I think he also spoke of the restrictions insisted upon in order to secure the safety of the lives and the limbs of those who are employed, and my noble friend behind me cited as a further illustration the familiar case of the Truck Act. I venture to think that none of those cases are really on all fours with the case of the present Bill.<lb/>
I think the noble Earl who leads the House grasped the nettle rather more courageously when he said frankly, as I understood him, that this proposal really was an entirely novel one. I can recall only the case of the fair wages clause which we insert in Government contracts as a precedent for the kind of proposals which are now before us, and unless I am much mistaken that resolution of the other House of Parliament has been a very fertile source of trouble to the Departments who have been engaged in interpreting it. Surely there is a great difference between these ordinary cases of interference and the kind of interference to which you are now going to resort. It is not, after all, a very difficult thing to decide whether premises are in a sanitary or insanitary condition, whether sufficient precautions are taken to protect life and limb, or to find out whether an employer pays his <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> in coin or in kind. Those are matters which can be disposed of, I will not say without difficulty, but with comparative ease. But when you ask people to lay down what is and what is not a reasonable rate of remuneration you find yourselves upon much more difficult ground. What may be reasonable in one place may not be reasonable in others; what may be reasonable for one person or class of persons may not be reasonable for other persons or other classes; and therefore I do venture to think that this is, as the noble Earl admitted, a new departure and a very serious new departure. I am, therefore, glad that in the sixth clause there is a small modicum of latitude given to the responsible Department to allow wages below the minimum rate in certain cases where it would obviously be a great hardship to prevent people from being employed at those somewhat lower rates.<lb/>
The sound principle in all these cases is surely that which was laid down by the noble Lord behind me&#x2014;namely, that it is for the trades themselves to combine and fix, by their own efforts, what shall be the re-
<col>1012</col>
cognised rate of remuneration for any kind of employment. That is, I venture to say, the only really sound principle. We have, of course, recognised, and recognised to the full, the right of trades to organise and to combine, in any way they think proper, for the purpose of bringing about that result. There is one argument, and one argument only for the Bill on the Table, which is that we are dealing with trades which are followed by persons who are so helpless and so miserable in their circumstances that it is not possible for them to combine and organise and protect themselves in the manner in which those protect themselves who are engaged upon fully organised trades and industries. Therefore, upon that representation and upon that representation only, which I conceive to be a perfectly correct one, I am ready to accept the principle of this Bill.<lb/>
But I do so with two reservations. First, this Bill is to be regarded, as I believe His Majesty's Government desire it to be regarded, as an experiment; and, in the next place, they anticipate from this experiment that they may possibly, by means of these Trade Boards and trade committees, be able to educate the weak and unorganised trades and encourage them after a while to combine for their own protection just as other better organised and more advanced trades have combined. I am very glad that His Majesty's Government in this Bill do not ask Parliament to part with its control over this subject. To my mind it is of the utmost importance that it should be clearly laid down in the Bill that its provisions are not to be extended to any trades except those mentioned in the Bill itself without the explicit concurrence of Parliament. I go as far as saying that if some provision of that kind had not been in the Bill I should have had very great difficulty in giving it my support.<lb/>
May I say a word as to one or two points which strike me amongst the provisions of the measure? There are two provisions in the sixth and eighth clauses under which, unless I misunderstand them, the onus of proof that the wages paid for piece work are equal to the minimum time rate is thrown upon the employer. That strikes me as a somewhat unusual proposal. Surely it would be enough to leave it to these boards and committees to examine the facts and decide upon them without assuming in a case of that kind that the employer is guilty of a contravention of the Act until he has
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0510"/>
<col>1013</col>
been able to prove the contrary. Then I am not sure that I do not rather regret that the Bill did not follow what I understand to be the recommendation of the Committee and restrict its operation to home industries instead of extending it to factories. The mere fact that people are employed in a factory seems to suggest that they might be in a position to combine and to organise themselves, but the noble Lord, who has a right of reply, will, I dare say, be able to satisfy me on that point.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I wish to express a hope that those who are responsible for the operation of this Bill will watch very carefully over its effects. It seems to me that it may occasion very serious hardship to people whom we should be very sorry to see suffering in consequence of these well-intentioned efforts. Is it not the case that under this Bill some of those who have depended for their livelihood upon what is called a sweated industry may find themselves obliged to choose between badly-paid work and no work at all? I know that His Majesty's Government have the authority of the Committee for saying that if the effect of their legislation should be to annihilate a particular trade the work of the persons employed in that trade will be diverted into other channels. But are we quite sure there will always be other channels into which their work will be diverted? That seems to me, in days when unemployment is rife throughout the country, a somewhat sanguine-expectation on the part of the Committee. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill, I thought, was not quite consistent in his treatment of that part of the case. He told us rather confidently that in the view of His Majesty's Government it was not likely that any trades would be crushed out, but then he added that in some cases we should be well rid of a trade which was carried on under particularly deplorable circumstances, and no doubt he was aware that in that view he had behind him the opinion of the Committee, because the Committee certainly stated that it was better that some branches of industry should be abandoned altogether than that they should be carried on under conditions of excessive toil and miserably inadequate earnings. I think there is a great deal to be said for the view of the Committee, but my point is this, that if this should be the result of the passing of the Bill, you will have to look forward to a great deal of at any rate temporary hardship and suffering, and I trust
<col>1014</col>
that His Majesty's Government will be prepared to deal with it should it arise.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me (Lord Ampthill) very naturally could not resist a little excursion into the regions of Tariff Reform. The subject, no doubt, is a very tempting one in connection with this and other measures for which His Majesty's Government have been responsible. I will not at this period of the evening follow him on to that ground. I will merely say that I think it would reassure a good many people if the noble Lord who will reply to me were able to tell us that, at any rate so far as Government contracts are concerned, the responsible Departments will satisfy themselves that they do not transfer their custom from this country to other countries where certain commodities which they require are produced under conditions which are indistinguishable from those which we will not tolerate here because they involve what we regard as the sweating of the trade. The noble Lord told us that other countries were moving and that legislation dealing with sweating was imminent on their part, but we do not know that the legislation has been actually had yet, and I do think that some general assurance on these points would be a not very unreasonable one to expect. All that I would say upon that branch of the question is this, that I note with considerable satisfaction the admission on the part of the Government which runs through the whole of this Bill, that in dealing with these questions we have to think of something more than the mere volume of our trade and the amount of profit made by those engaged in it. There are other considerations, and I regard this Bill as a very important admission that what is more important than the mere volume of our trade and the profits made by our traders is that those employed should receive reasonable remuneration for their labour, that they should be sure of regular employment, and that they should follow that employment under sound and healthy conditions. With these few observations I gladly give my vote for the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02321"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Marquess has pointed out, I have a right of reply, though it is not a right which I should wish to exercise in view of the very favourable and flattering reception which the Bill has received. As the representative of the Department
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0511"/>
<col>1015</col>
in which this Bill originated that reception has naturally been most gratifying to me and it will be equally gratifying to the Government in general. The noble Marquess raised three points on which he asked for answers. In the first place, he dealt with the fact that the onus of proof is put upon the employer. That is necessary, because if anything is to be done under these penal clauses this is one of those cases in which the onus of proof must be placed on the accused. The only proof in a case of this kind would come from the keeping of books. If the employer did not keep books there would be no proof one way or the other as to the wages he had paid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02322"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: There would be the oath of the worker as to the wages paid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02323"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: I am dealing with it from the point of view of the employer. The employer can have absolute proof of the wages he has paid by keeping books, and if he does not choose to do so he is not taking advantage of the obvious possibilities of the situation. Then the noble Marquess dealt with the inclusion of factories in this Bill, and expressed regret that the Bill had not been restricted in its operation to home workers. It was not possible to do that efficiently, because home work and factory work are in certain trades so much mixed up that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle them, and because there are many cases in which factory workers are paid, and certainly could be paid, wages which would be lower than the minimum fixed for home workers. Home workers would then be legislated out of existence altogether, and
<col>1016</col>
instead of benefiting home workers we should really be doing them an injury by such a proceeding. The noble Marquess next alluded to my statement that we did not think it likely that any trade would be crushed out of existence by this Bill, and he contrasted it with another statement I made that there were certain trades which would be no loss if they were crushed out of existence. The explanation really lies in this. When I said that no trade would be crushed out of existence I was alluding to the four trades actually in the Schedule. I alluded to the support which has been given to the Bill by the members of those trades and said I thought this showed that they were confident that their trades would not be injuriously affected. There are, as the noble Earl the Leader of the House has pointed out, certain moribund trades which are carried on at present perhaps almost at a loss, and which might conceivably be crushed out. In those circumstances it is believed that the people working in those trades would receive employment in the factories which would take the place of the obsolete methods under which those trades are now carried on, and on the whole, perhaps, as my noble friend has pointed out, the kindest thing to these people would be that those trades should come to an end. I wish to express again my own thanks and the thanks of the Government for the favourable reception your Lordships have given to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02333"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have given private notice to the noble Earl who leads the House that I should ask him whether he can give us any further information as to the course of business during the remainder of the session. Our anxiety on this point is, I think, not unreasonable, and it has been somewhat intensified by the apparent conflict between different statements which have been made on different occasions by His Majesty's Government. May I remind the noble Earl that when we separated on August 5 he told us that it was then expected that the Irish Land Bill would arrive here in the week beginning on August 30, and that therefore it would be possible to take that Bill, if desired, in the second week in September? Since then the noble Earl has very courteously given me private information to the effect that it was probable that the Housing and Town Planning Bill would reach us on September 10, so that we might have the Second Reading on the following week; and he anticipated that the Irish Land Bill would reach this House on September 17, and that we should be able to take the Second Reading in the week beginning September 20. I dare say the noble Earl has noticed in <i>The Times</i> of to-day, in a column the contents of which generally have at least the suspicion of official inspiration, a statement that the Housing and Town Planning Bill is not likely to be finished by the House of Commons so soon as September 10, and that the Irish Land Bill is to be laid aside and resumed by the House of Commons on September 23. It is quite clear that, if there is any foundation for that statement, the information given to me by the noble Earl will require to be very materially modified. The position seems to me to be becoming very serious. The Prime Minister announced the other day in the House of Commons that, besides the Finance Bill, the Irish Land Bill, and the London Elections Bill, which he apparently regarded as undoubtedly measures of a controversial character, there was a series of no fewer than thirteen Bills which he said were in his opinion not of a contentious nature. I will not read the list, because the noble Earl is probably perfectly familiar with them. I may perhaps observe that amongst the thirteen non-contentious measures is included the Housing and Town Planning Bill, which we can scarcely be expected to admit is one of those trifling measures which could be allowed to go
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0513"/>
<col>1019</col>
through without discussion. Besides these thirteen Bills, there are ten more Bills described by the Prime Minister as uncertain, of which some were to be proceeded with, and your Lordships will have observed that last night no fewer than eleven Bills came up to this House from the House of Commons and were read a first time. I must say greatly to my surprise I find on the Order Paper for to-night that four of those Bills, which first appeared in this House yesterday evening at half-past four, are put down for Second Reading this evening. Those Bills were not even distributed this morning, and I am not using the language of exaggeration when I say that I have, personally, not the faintest idea of what the contents of some of those Bills may be. I must protest against our being harried in that fashion. This great mass of business, business not all, perhaps, of first-rate importance, but still requiring the attention of Parliament, is, apparently, to be got through in the interstices of the three great Bills&#x2014;The Finance Bill, the Irish Land Bill, and the Housing and Town Planning Bill&#x2014;which we are not to be allowed to deal with until after the middle of next month upon the most favourable anticipation of events. I make no apology for having brought this matter before the House, and I do desire to add this one observation before I sit down, that, in these days, when Bills even of first-rate importance are passed through the House of Commons with not even the pretence of discussion, it becomes of infinitely greater importance that we in this House should have full opportunity of considering them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02334"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Marquess for giving me notice of his intention of asking this Question. It is quite true that the forecast of business which I gave in the early part of the month has, in some respects, been falsified by the change in the order of business in another place. It certainly was understood at that time that the Irish Land Bill would be the first we should receive, and that it would be followed by the Housing and Town Planning Bill. As the noble Marquess has pointed out, I wrote to him as soon as I was in a position to do so stating what I believed would be the course of events after these alterations had taken place in the House of Commons' order of business. I have no reason to suppose that what I said to
<col>1020</col>
the noble Marquess in that letter is not perfectly accurate. I have no reason to anticipate that we shall not receive the Housing and Town Planning Bill here towards the close of next week, and that it may be possible to take the Second Reading in the course of the following week. It is equally the case, so far as I know, that the Irish Land Bill ought to reach us in the course of the week following, and that we should be able to take the Second Reading of that measure in the succeeding week. There are no Notices on the Paper, and, as the Bills which were brought up last night are not of a character, I think, which need detain your Lordships in London, it is not proposed, with the approval of noble Lords opposite, to meet again until Monday, September 13, when the Committee stage of the Trade Boards Bill will be taken, and on that day, possibly, and Tuesday we may be able to get on with some of the small measures which have come up to us from another place. When the noble Marquess talks about eleven Bills having come up from the House of Commons, he did not state that four or five of them are Charity Bills of, so far as I know, a quite ordinary and formal kind, and I do not think there is one Bill amongst those which came up yesterday which need occupy your Lordships' House for an hour, and in saying that I am giving what seems to me a liberal allowance of time, When the Prime Minister in another place spoke of various Bills being non-controversial, and included the Housing Bill in that list, he was, I think, perfectly accurate. It does not in the least follow that a non-controversial Bill may not be a Bill demanding close inspection and even considerable discussion, but certainly the Bill cannot be said to raise matters of acute controversy in the sense that no doubt the, Irish Land Bill and possibly, also, the London Elections Bill may be supposed to do. I have often agreed on former occasions that it is exceedingly undesirable to hurry into the closing weeks of the session a great mass of business from another place. The noble Marquess will do me the justice to say that I have always sympathised with observations which have been made from the Benches opposite on that subject, but I confess that so far as I am able to see, there is no prospect of anything like a real congestion of business in the course of this session. It is impossible, of course, to say how many days your Lordships may
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0514"/>
<col>1021</col>
wish to give either to the Housing and Town Planning Bill or to the Irish Land Bill, but without attempting to forecast the actual date on which the Finance Bill will reach your Lordships' House, I think it is clear that there ought to be a reasonable margin, with steady work after the middle of September, for giving all the Bills that come before your Lordships' House that consideration which we all agree is their due. I have no reason to suppose that the contrary is the least likely to occur, and I shall feel very greatly disappointed if it does.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02335"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad to hear that the noble Earl sees no reason to depart from the information regarding the course of business which he gave privately to the noble Marquess; but I ant rather surprised that he should find his hopes falsified as regards the immediate business to come before the House. After all, the matter is entirely in the hands of the noble Earl and his colleagues, and it seems to me that it would not have been very difficult to make such arrangements that the pledges which the noble Earl gave might have been fulfilled this week and next week. I would point out to the noble Earl and to the House that it is somewhat important from another point of view. Owing to the unusual prolongation of the session certain private Bills and provisional orders which have been put down for consideration in another place have not been pressed forward with that rapidity which is usual in an ordinary session, and, consequently, they have not yet reached your Lordships' House. It is very necessary, when these Bills do come to this House, that we should get Committees together to consider them. The noble Earl proposes that the House should adjourn at the conclusion of to-day's sitting until September 13. I earnestly hope that there will be no further adjournment after your Lordships reassemble on that day, and that the public business of the House may proceed at the same time as the consideration of private Bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02336"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has made no reply to my noble friend in regard to the four Bills down on the Paper for Second Reading to-day, which only reached your Lordships' House last night and of the contents of which we are ignorant. We suggest respectfully that unless there is some very strong reason, with
<col>1022</col>
which we are unacquainted, for taking them to-day, it would be little short of a scandal to ask the House to take Bills which your Lordships have not even read. I hope the noble Earl will inform the House on what date the Second Reading of the Housing and Town Planning Bill will be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02337"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry that I omitted to answer the noble Marquess's question. The four Bills which were placed on the Paper for Second Reading to-day are none of them of at all an important character, except a Bill which the Treasury are extremely anxious to advance&#x2014;the Superannuation Bill. But if noble Lords opposite think the matter is not one with which they would like to deal at such short notice, we must, of course, fall in with their wishes, and, if the noble Marquess desires it, we can postpone the Second Reading of that Bill and of the others until September 13. The most rev. Primate has a Motion in regard to the Report of the Poor Law Commission down for Wednesday, September 15, and I think it would therefore be safe to say that we can take the Second Reading of the Housing and Town Planning Bill on Thursday, September 16&#x2020;.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Viscount explained that the Amendments standing in his name had originally been in the name of Lord Balfour of Burleigh, who was, however, unable to be present. These Amendments, speaking generally, represented the alterations in the Bill desired by what he might call the federation of the great fire insurance offices. They represented the views of very wealthy and powerful organisations which by general consent had a very creditable history and a reputation for stability and trustworthiness not only in this country but throughout the whole world. These offices were not taking up an attitude of hostility to the Bill, but were submitting Amendments merely to provide for some things which it was felt ought to be done, and which they themselves did independently of legal compulsion. They felt that there were certain points in which the Bill was capable of amendment. Those matters were taken up originally on their behalf by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, but when, owing to Lord Balfour's absence, the Amendments fell through, the offices had great difficulty at this time of the year in obtaining another spokesman in their Lordships' House, because the situation happened quite suddenly and recently, and amid the general dispersal of their Lordships. It was only with the greatest reluctance that he agreed himself to put down the Amendments, not because he did not agree with them&#x2014;he thought they were all very reasonable&#x2014;but because he would have preferred that they should have been moved by some one who was not a director of one of these companies. One was open to the suspicion of being interested in one's own case, but he hoped to be able to put the case in a way which would acquit him of having any other wish in the matter than that the reasonable views of these great and powerful corporations, which were certainly entitled to every con-

<col>1025</col>
sideration Parliament could give them, should be considered by their Lordships' House. Fortunately the Amendments, though numerous, were easy to explain, and the first Amendment could be explained in a couple of sentences. Its object was that after the word "policies," wherever that word occurred in the first clause, the words "or other contracts" should be inserted. This seemed to him a necessary Amendment, because there were many contracts of insurance which did not take the form of a regular policy, and without the words which he proposed to insert the Bill would fail in its application to a wide sphere of insurance business. He would give only a single instance, but it was an important one&#x2014;that of the different agreements made for what was known as reinsurance, which, as their Lordships were aware, was a very important part of insurance business. Agreements for reinsurance did not generally take the form of policies; they were constantly effected by letter, and often by a series of verbal communications subsequently embodied in a schedule which the two parties signed. The proposal he submitted to the Committee was that such business, whether it was reinsurance business or insurance business of another kind contained in documents other than policies, should not be left out of the scope of the Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02351"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said he fully admitted the great importance of the interest which the noble Viscount represented. It was an interest which had been given the fullest possible hearing, and to which the greatest importance was attached by the Board of Trade. The noble Viscount had given what he described as an instance, but he thought it was rather more than an instance. Reinsurance, he was informed, was the only fonts of insurance business not carried out by a policy, and would, therefore, be the only form affected by the Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02353"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said that, though very large and very important, reinsurance was not the class of business
<col>1026</col>
which the Bill was intended to protect. All the provisions of the Bill in regard to publicity and in regard to deposits were inserted for the protection of the public, who, it might be supposed, would otherwise be unable to look after themselves and investigate the stability of the insurance companies. Reinsurance, however, was effected among the various insurance companies, and those great corporations were perfectly capable of looking after themselves. It was most undesirable to interfere with the course of business where it could not be shown to be absolutely necessary to do so, and on these grounds the Government could not accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02354"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> was not convinced by the arguments of the noble Lord that his noble friend on the Cross Benches was wrong in this Amendment. He did not see why there should not be the same amount of protection as between one company and another as between companies and the public. Every one acquainted with this class of business knew what an enormous amount of reinsurance business was done between the various companies concerned. He suggested that the point would be better dealt with on the interpretation clause. The noble Viscount had an Amendment on the Paper to this clause&#x2014; Clause 28&#x2014;by which he sought to provide that the expression "policy" should include any instrument evidencing a contract of insurance; and it would seem that if any change was to be made in the Bill on the point in question it might more appropriately be made in that clause than in Clause 1.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02355"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> hoped His Majesty's Government would see their way to accept the Amendment in some form or other. Unless it was inserted all the other provisions in the Bill dealing with policies of insurance would not apply to contracts between insurance companies, and therefore the companies would find some difficulty in making out the returns required under the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02356"><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said it was clear that there was a considerable body of opinion in the Committee in favour of his Amendment. It was a little difficult to say whether the Amendment had better be introduced in this clause or in a later clause. If the noble Lord could give him

<col>1027</col>
an assurance that the Government would deal with the point on Report and provide that words should be inserted which would make the Bill applicable to contracts of reinsurance he would not press the Amendment. But it was highly important that the Bill should so apply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02357"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount says that a considerable body of opinion is in favour of the Amendment. It is quite true that three noble Lords, speaking on behalf of insurance companies, have expressed the opinion that this would be a desirable addition to the Bill, but my noble friend has pointed out that in the view of the Board of Trade it is not the business of the Government, in framing a Bill of this kind for the protection of the public, to deal with what really are private proceedings taking place between different companies. I confess that there does seem to anybody outside that mystic circle a very considerable difference between the two things. The ordinary insurer is a comparatively helpless person, but it seems to me that it demands something more than mere assertion when it is said that it is necessary that these safeguards should be applied to the great companies who have dealings, no doubt of a most reasonable and sensible kind, with each other for the purpose of dividing up large insurances and for reinsurance generally. All that we have heard from noble Lords is a statement of their opinion that it ought to be done, but they have given no reason.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02358"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> expressed surprise that the noble Earl should speak with a certain amount of disdain of the measure of support which the Amendment had received in their Lordships' House.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02362"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said the three noble Lords who had spoken in support of the Amendment had an intimate acquaintance with the subject. If the support of an Amendment was to be counted

by the number of speakers in its favour the proceedings of their Lordships' House would be reduced to the level of those of the House of Commons. He hoped the noble Viscount would adopt Lord St. Aldwyn's suggestion and take the decision upon the Amendment when the interpretation clause was reached. That would be a shorter and more complete way of dealing with the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02363"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> hoped the noble Viscount would adopt that course. He had given the reasons why the Government did not consider the Amendment necessary, but if the noble Viscount would postpone it they were prepared to reconsider the matter.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02366"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> moved an Amendment to bring within the scope of the Bill "the issue of policies by which the payment of money is assured at a future date, independently of any life or other contingency, and not being bond investment business as hereinafter defined." He said it was just as important to ensure the fulfilment of a contract in the case of a sinking fund policy or a leasehold redemption policy as it was to fulfil a contract on life or against fire. In this matter he represented the life offices, and the Amendments standing in his name had been put down from the point of view of the life offices more especially, though some of them applied to other insurance companies as well. The whole of his Amendments really came back to this point, that the English policy holder, whatever the risk might be that he had insured against, should have as much protection as was possible against failure to fulfil the obligations entered into.</p>

tion policies. If it was necessary to include those forms of business within the scope of the Bill it was clear that this was not the right place to do it. They ought to be grouped with other companies carrying on approximately the same kind of business, such as bond investment business. With regard to the advisability of including this class of business at all, the Government did not think it was necessary. Bond investment business had been included because the people who took out bond investment policies were poor people who had shown themselves peculiarly liable to be misled. In the case of sinking fund policies and capital redemption policies there was not such strong reason for inclusion, because those companies did business in large sums with people who understood fully the nature of the bargain into which they entered.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02369"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> could not agree with the noble Lord that all sinking fund business or endowment business not included in subsection (<i>e</i>) of Clause 1 was conducted by persons who were well able to take care of themselves. These insurances were effected in many cases for sums by no means large, and he saw no reason, if bond investment business was included, why sinking fund business or the ordinary endowment business conducted by life assurance companies should be excluded. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill was quite right in declining to accept the Amendment in this subsection, but he hoped he would reconsider the matter and include it on Report.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02401"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> asked what the difference to the policy holder was between amalgamation and transfer. He was in favour of the fullest information being given to every one, but did not see why it should be done in one case and not in the other.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02402"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> thought the difference between amalgamation and transfer was probably this. When two companies were amalgamated the shareholders of one company might be paid by shares of the other company. That would be an amalgamation, and both would be shareholders of one company.

This was a matter of very great simplicity, and he did not think there was any reason why the Board of Trade should not accept the Amendment, especially as it appeared from subsequent Amendments of their own that they realised the necessity of some
<col>1034</col>
provision of this kind. It was necessary that security should be provided for persons assured, but beyond that it was undesirable to put difficulties in the way of amalgamation. When life assurance companies amalgamated the assured should have full notice, for theirs were long continuance contracts, but fire, accident, and employers' liability contracts were renewed from year to year, and if every one of these persons, some of whom might be abroad and could only be reached by letters taking weeks, had to be informed before amalgamation could take place, it would be a useless and serious obstacle in the way.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02408"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the Government agreed that the regulation should not be extended to employers' liability policies.

<col>1035</col>
quent Amendment of their own met the offices in so far as fire policies and accident policies were concerned, but not in so far as employers' liability was concerned. He could not see what reason there was for treating an employers' liability policy, which was an annual policy, differently. He did not deny that there was a certain force in what the noble Lord had said as to the inclusion of employers' liability policies, but he could not think it was reasonable that every person in receipt of a weekly payment or even an annual payment in compensation for an accident of some small account should be entitled to object to the amalgamation of the company which made him that payment. He did not think it was an interest of the same order as in the case of life policies. If he thought there was the slightest danger of the parties so insured suffering through an amalgamation he would be the first to agree with the noble Lord, but it seemed to him that their case was absolutely provided for in other parts of the Bill. By the Fourth Schedule every company doing employers' liability or accident business was compelled to give the particulars of every single claim to which they had become liable, and in their revenue statements under the First Schedule they were practically compelled to show that they had assets covering those liabilities. Therefore under the Bill persons who had continuing payments stretching over years to receive from insurance companies under employers' liabilty policies were so absolutely safeguarded that it was not really necessary to introduce the exceptional complication of having to send notices to every one of those persons whenever one of the companies contemplated amalgamation. The matter was of such importance that he hoped the Government would be able to accept the whole of his Amendment instead of three-fourths of it, as they already did.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02412"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that as far as he understood the Bill the provision in this subsection regarding notice would not at all affect those persons in whom the noble Lord who represented the Government was interested&#x2014;namely, the persons to whom some payment was made as the result of an insurance effected by their employer under the Employers' Liability Act&#x2014;because they were not policy holders. If these persons ought to have notice, and probably they ought, that provision would have to be made in some other part of the Bill. He could not support the Amend-

ment in its present form. The noble Viscount proposed that if the amalgamating or transferred company carried on another or other class or classes of insurance business in addition to the business of life assurance, it should not be necessary to transmit such statement to the policy holders of such companies or company other than life policy holders. But he was sure the noble Viscount would agree that in the case of a company carrying on endowment business or any business of that sort, persons who held such policies ought to have notice of any amalgamation or transfer. He suggested that the Amendment might be withdrawn now and brought up on the Report stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02413"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the Government were prepared to consider the matter again before Report, but he could give no promise that they were at all likely to accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02414"><member>LORD KINNAIRD</member> thought it would be better to insert the Amendment now, and then if it was thought unadvisable the matter could be reconsidered at a later stage. If the Bill was passed as it stood amalgamations and transfers would be rendered practically impossible. Moreover, the persons whom it was desired to protect were already protected by the existence of the employers' liability fund.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02415"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> said there was such an immense number of these small policies that if the clause was insisted upon as it at present stood it would stop all amalgamations. He failed to see what practical objection there could be to accepting Lord Milner's Amendment. There was no chance whatever of any of these persons suffering loss through amalgamation. If the large policy holders agreed to the amalgamation, surely it was reasonable to suppose that the amalgamation was in the general interest and that no one would suffer. On the other hand, there was great practical advantage in accepting the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02416"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I should like to explain to the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, that the point to which he directed attention a moment ago is dealt with in Clause 32, subsection (1), paragraph (<i>h</i>), which provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"Where any sum is due or a weekly payment is payable under any policy, the expression 'policy holder' includes the person to whom the sum is due or the weekly payment payable."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0522"/>
<col>1037</col>
Therefore these people are policy holders under the Bill as it stands. With regard to the point raised by the noble Lord on the Cross Benches (Lord Kinnaird), the matter is not one of very great importance. It does not very much matter whether the Bill stands as it does now and the noble Viscount moves his Amendment at a future stage, or whether the Bill is altered now and His Majesty's Government move later to restore it to its original shape; but I think it is the more usual course to leave the Bill as it stands and for the Amendment to be brought up again.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02417"><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said he would have been very glad to allow the Amendment to stand over till the Report stage but for the statement of the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, who, while promising to consider the matter again, declared that the Government had practically made up their mind not to accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02418"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he would have felt no hesitation whatever in voting for the noble Viscount's Amendment but for the observations made by his noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn, who pointed out that there was one direction in which the Amendment probably went too far. There was, of course, no reason why the noble Viscount should not press his Amendment now and at a later stage modify it in order to meet Lord St. Aldwyn's views; but it would, perhaps, be better to put the Amendment in its proper shape before inserting it in the Bill. He suggested that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill should consider the Amendment with a rather more open mind than he seemed to indicate. The noble Lord promised most courteously to consider the matter between now and Report, but that concession was almost at once withdrawn by the information that he thought his mind was absolutely made up. If the noble Lord would go a step further and say that he would consider the Amendment with an open mind, they might, perhaps, come to an agreement to let it stand over to the Report stage. The matter was of importance, because noble Lords familiar with the subject had declared that if the Bill remained in its present shape the difficulties in the way of amalgamation would be so great as to be almost prohibitive; and there was also the fact that to some extent&#x2014;namely, with regard to fire and accident policies&#x2014;the noble Lord
<col>1038</col>
in charge of the Bill and the noble Viscount were agreed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02419"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> was very sorry to appear obstinate in the matter, but he thought the noble Marquess had forgotten the facts of the case. The unusually long period of two months was allowed to elapse between the Second Reading and the Committee stage in order that the proposals of the Bill might be fully considered by those who were interested in them. The Government had listened to all views and made every possible, or almost every possible, concession. There were fourteen Amendments standing in his name on the Paper, all of which were in the nature of concessions. He therefore thought he could hardly be charged with not having an open mind. He did say that he would reconsider the matter, but he did not wish to mislead their Lordships into thinking that those words bore the interpretation which they were often held to bear when used in their Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02420"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> thought the term "concessions" was sometimes used by His Majesty's Government in a wrong sense. The Government had made mistakes, and were trying to correct them. That was not necessarily making concessions. He suggested that the concluding words of the Amendment should be altered to "other than life endowment, sinking fund, or bond investment policy holders." He submitted that those were all the persons whom it was necessary to consult.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02421"><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> expressed willingness to amend his Amendment as suggested by Lord St. Aldwyn. It was never his intention that the Amendment should extend to endowment, sinking fund, or bond investment policies. The proviso, as amended, and as he now submitted it to the Committee, would therefore read&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that wherever in the case of amalgamation the amalgamating companies, or either of them, or in the case of transfer, the transferred company carries on another or other class or classes of assurance business in addition to the business of life assurance it shall not be necessary to transmit such statement to the policy holders of such companies or company other than life endowment, sinking fund, or bond investment policy holders."</quote></p>

In Clause 29, paragraph (<i>d</i>), there were words which he thought would enable the Government to agree to omit Clause 14 without any detriment to the Bill. That paragraph provided that where the company intended to amalgamate with or to transfer its life assurance business to another assurance company, the Court should not sanction the amalgamation or transfer in any case in which it appeared to the Court that the life policy holders representing one-tenth or more of the total amount assured in the company dissented from the amalgamation or transfer. This showed that the life assurance company would have to go through the form of
<col>1040</col>
applying to the Court. If, on the other hand, Clause 14 remained as it now stood, he was advised that it would necessitate a private Act of Parliament in the case of nearly every amalgamation or transfer where life assurance was affected. If that was so, he thought it would be better to omit Clause 14 altogether and rely on the protection given in paragraph (<i>d</i>) of Clause 29.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02430"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said this was not a new clause, but reproduced <i>verbalim</i> Section 7 of the Life Assurance Companies Act of 1872. Its object, he understood, was this. In the event of company A being amalgamated with company B, what this clause provided was that supposing the policy holder in company A kept up his policy and made payments of his premiums to the new company, that was not to imply that he accepted the new order of things, and was not to be any bar to him in standing upon any rights which he had as against the old company. He thought this was a fair proposal, because it was obvious that the policy holder must keep up his payments. If he did not pay the premium the policy would lapse, and it would be very unfair, as might be the case without a clause of this kind, that such a payment made under those circumstances should be taken as implying his acquiescence in the new state of things and depriving him of any rights he had before.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02438"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the words in question had been substituted for the word "insolvent," which appeared in the old Act. That had been done deliberately, and with the object of bringing this clause into harmony with Sections 129 and 130 of the Companies Consolidation Act of last year. These words occurred in the definition clause of that Act, and what would happen would be that the company would come before the Court and the Court, in terms of the Companies Consolidation Act, would find that it was unable to pay its debts. That would be the finding of the Court, and these words were inserted in the clause in order to bring this Bill into conformity with the Act of last year.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02439"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> contended that the inclusion of the word "insolvent" was very important from an actuarial point of view, and said that great stress was laid upon the Amendment by the Institute of Actuaries.</p>

He explained that the Companies Consolidation Act provided that every company incorporated outside the United Kingdom should register with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies the name and address of some person resident within this country who might be sued on behalf of the company so incorporated. The reason for the proposed new clause was that there were certain assurance companies carrying on business in this country which were not incorporated at all. They were mutual companies formed in a different way, and it was to apply to them the provision with regard to a resident person who might be sued on their behalf that this Amendment had been introduced.</p>

<quote>(3) Save as otherwise expressly provided by this Act nothing in this Act shall apply to assurance business of any class other than one of the classes specified in section one of this Act, and a policy shall not be deemed to be a policy of fire insurance by reason only that loss by fire is one of the various risks covered by the policy,"</quote>
by leaving out from "or, in the case of fire insurance business or accident insurance business" to the end of subsection (2). The main purpose of the Bill, he said, was to protect the public and to give them the
<col>1044</col>
maximum of security with respect to any insurances they might effect. With that object it imposed a number of obligations as regarded the deposit, as regarded the form of keeping accounts, as regarded audit, and so forth, on all great insurance companies. It would be useless to do that from the point of view of securing the public if other persons or associations of persons were not to be expected to give similar or equivalent guarantees. He thought the Government fully recognised that, for by Clause 27 and the Eighth Schedule, which carried out further the objects of this clause, it was provided that underwriters and associations of underwriters should be subjected to certain regulations, not similar in their form to those applicable to insurance companies, but similar in their object of giving a guarantee to the public of their stability and of their ability to fulfil their engagements. The obligations so imposed upon underwriters and associations of underwriters seemed to him to be in themselves reasonable. Every underwriter had to deposit &#x00A3;2,000&#x2014;surely not a very large sum to demand as a guarantee from a man engaging in such a responsible business as insurance. They did not want men of straw to engage in this business. In addition to this, the obligation was placed upon the underwriter of periodically furnishing statements, such as the Board of Trade might prescribe, showing the extent and the character of his business. If the clause and the schedule had been allowed to stand in that form he did not think there could be any objection. It was perfectly true that even then associations of underwriters would have been treated by the Bill perhaps a little more favourably than the insurance companies, but he did not contend that the circumstances of these associations were exactly identical with those of insurance companies, or that a differentiation in certain respects could have been avoided. If the provision stood without the words which he proposed to omit, although possibly it might be somewhat more favourable to associations of underwriters than to companies, he did not think any one would have any cause of complaint. The last lines of this subsection, however, entirely destroyed the whole system of obtaining a guarantee from underwriters in respect of fire and accident insurance. Instead of coming under the operation of the Statute they would be able to draw up regulations to be approved by the Board of Trade. Why was this exceptional treatment of underwriters and associations
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0526"/>
<col>1045</col>
of underwriters confined to fire insurance and accident insurance business? Why should the deposit of &#x00A3;2,000 be necessary in the case of a man carrying on employers' liability business or life assurance business and not be necessary in the case of a man carrying on fire or accident insurance business? There was another point. Here were two classes of institutions, insurance companies on the one hand and associations of underwriters on the other, carrying on the same business. Parliament stepped in to rightly impose upon them certain regulations to safeguard the public. In the case of one set of persons, the companies, those regulations were defined in every detail by Act of Parliament, but with regard to the other set of persons who entered into competition with the companies, the Bill began by laying down equally definite guarantees for their solvency but then went on in the words which he proposed to omit, to annihilate those guarantees with regard to certain kinds of business and to substitute for the definite statutory obligations imposed on the companies regulations to be made by the underwriters themselves with the approval of the Board of Trade. He did not wish to say anything in criticism of the Board of Trade. There was no public Department which commanded more confidence either in Parliament or outside, and he thought the Board thoroughly deserved that confidence; but there was a limit to the amount of discretionary power which it was reasonable to place in the hands of any public Department. He maintained that as between competing bodies of persons engaged in the same business, both equally entitled to carry it on with as little interference as need be on the part of the State, it was not reasonable that the securities to be given by the companies should be precisely and definitely laid down in an Act of Parliament and that the equivalent guarantees demanded of their competitors, the underwriters, should be left to be fixed by themselves with the consent of the Board of Trade. To use a vulgar phrase, what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander. He did not say that there should be precisely the same guarantees in regard to companies and underwriters, but he did object to the guarantee in one case being statutory and in the other case subject to regulations which might be changed. If the words in question were deleted substantial justice would be done as between the competing parties.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02459">"In page 11, lines 21 to 27, to leave out the words 'or in the case of fire insurance business or accident insurance business he either complies with those requirements or furnishes such security and complies with such regulations applicable to those classes of business as may for the time being be made by the Committee of Lloyd's or the committee of management of such other association as aforesaid, and be approved by the Board of Trade.'"&#x2014; (<i>Viscount Milner</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02460"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the Government could not accept the Amendment. They had laid down in the Eighth Schedule a series of regulations to which any underwriter wishing to carry on this business must conform, but in the clause under discussion they provided that if an underwriter was a member of an approved association&#x2014;at the present moment Lloyd's was the only one that existed, but there was no reason why there should not be others&#x2014;and complied with certain requirements agreed to by the association and the Board of Trade, he should be free to carry on these two classes of insurance business. The two objects which the Department had in making that arrangement were, first, to provide the fullest possible security for the public; and, secondly, to guard against the establishment of anything in the shape of a monopoly. They wished to have free trade in insurance as in other things, and not to make rules and regulations which would render it difficult for people to embark on this business, provided, of course, there were proper guarantees of stability. The Committee of Lloyd's had agreed that there should be a provision of security equal in amount to one year's premium for every member, that all premiums should be paid into a trust fund, and that there should be an extremely searching form of audit. These conditions probably provided greater security than that given by the ordinary conditions of insurance, and they were conditions to which no insurance company would care to be subjected. These regulations, which had been framed by the Committee of Lloyd's, were not secret in any way, and in order to show that the facts were as he had stated and that the security was really ample he would be prepared, if their Lordships desired it, to lay them on the Table of the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02461"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he would be sorry to contend that the same requirements could be laid down in the case of companies conducting this class of business
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0527"/>
<col>1047</col>
and individuals conducting it in the manner of underwriters; but he did not think the noble Lord in charge of the Bill had quite appreciated the main point raised in the noble Viscount's Amendment. For reasons which had appeared good to the Government, and which might be perfectly sound, it had been proposed that members of Lloyd's should be placed in a somewhat different position from that of persons who were not members of that society. He did not quite know why, because, whatever might be the importance of Lloyd's as an institution&#x2014;and no doubt it was a very important institution&#x2014;yet in these transactions carried out by members of Lloyd's the liability was solely on the person undertaking the transaction and not on Lloyd's as a body. The Government, however, proposed that members of Lloyd's, provided they complied with such regulations applicable to these classes of business as might, for the time being, be made by the Committee of Lloyd's and approved by the Board of Trade, should be allowed to contract themselves so to speak, out of the provisions of this Bill. The agreement arrived at between the Committee of Lloyd's and the Board of Trade, which, in the opinion of the Government, gave ample security, ought to be incorporated in the Bill. It was not businesslike to make an agreement of this kind which was subject to variation for members of Lloyd's, while making definite regulations which could not be altered without legislation for all other people. If the agreement were incorporated he thought the noble Viscount might be satisfied. At any rate, he would be able, if he thought the conditions insufficient, to propose certain alterations to make them sufficient, and Parliament would have the whole matter before it and be able to deal with it on the same lines, instead of making an exception in procedure which appeared to him unfair to the companies and other persons engaging in this business and singularly favourable to the members of Lloyd's.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02462"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member> said it was necessary to appreciate the enormous difference between insurance business done by companies and insurance as it was effected at Lloyd's. The object of the Bill was, of course, to provide for the safety, of the public in taking out policies from persons holding themselves out as ready to insure; but it must be borne in mind that there was an
<col>1048</col>
immense difference between the position of an underwriter at Lloyd's and a company. The expression "associations of underwriters" had been used, but that was erroneous if it conveyed the idea that there was any collective liability. Each underwriter was personally responsible for the amount he took, and was liable, not, like a company, to the extent of the limited capital, but to the extent of his whole property. It was important to note that the provision in subsection (2) which the noble Viscount desired to delete was confined to fire insurance and accident insurance business&#x2014;that was to say, business which ran off in the course of a year. It was not proposed to give this privilege in respect of any class of insurance which lasted for a lengthy period. Another point to be borne in mind was that no insurance could be effected at Lloyd's except through a broker, and the fact that the broker would possess daily and habitual knowledge of the people he was dealing with would be some protection for his clients. He believed that if the Eighth Schedule were to be strictly applied to the underwriters at Lloyd's it would place great hardship upon them, and it looked to him very much as if it would crush out altogether underwriting business of this kind.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02475"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the original legal holder of the policy was, of course, the person to whom it was issued but it might, and often did, happen that a policy was transferred by the original holder to another person. It was frequently for instance, given as a security for a loan. The person to whom it was transferred then gave notice to the company of the assignment of the policy, and he thereupon became the legal holder. Supposing any mistake were made by the company in entering the notice of the assignment of the policy, the person who was in fact the legal holder would, if the Amendment were adopted, cease to be the legal holder, and the person who, in error, appeared in the company's books would occupy his place. He could not accept the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02476"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> asked whether the Government would accept words requiring notice to be given to the company. Unless the company received notice, it was impossible for them to tell who was the legal holder.</p>

His noble and learned friend Lord Gorell had already described the nature of the policies of insurance issued by Lloyd's. A number of persons combined to insure a certain sum, each party writing his name for so many hundreds or scores of pounds as the case might be. Then the whole of these virtual insurers were bracketed, and against their names was written the name of some one individual through whom the policy was actually effected. The object of the Amendment was to make the point perfectly clear, because the word "underwriter" was often loosely used, and it might be contended that the only person to whom the Bill applied in the case of a

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02486"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> explained that this clause provided that where a company carried on life assurance business the Bill should apply with respect to that business subject to certain modifications, which were set out in subsections.

He moved to amend this paragraph by omitting the words "or death from any specified cause or causes." The object was to keep the different classes of insurance distinct. He understood that there were certain companies which issued policies nominally against accidents but in the accidents which were insured against under those policies there were no fewer than fifty-five different forms of death. It had appeared to the framers of the Bill that if the principle was extended any further great confusion would arise&#x2014;he would not put it higher than that. It would be

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02496"><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> moved an Amendment to make a condition for exemption of existing companies from the deposit provisions of the Bill that a company should set aside as a reserve for unexpired risks a third of the annual premium income. Under the Bill as it stood the security sought to be given to the public was admittedly incomplete, and the question arose whether something could not be done to give the same security in the case of existing companies which the Bill would give in the case of companies to be called into existence hereafter. There were, of course, many securities provided by the Bill which did apply to existing companies, but he was speaking of the one particular kind of guarantee which consisted in the deposit of a substantial sum. He quite saw the difficulty of asking existing companies at this stage of their career to put up a particular large sum. It was retroactive legislation to which there was always strong objection, and no sum could be named which would be anything like adequate in the case of the large companies which might not act rather unfairly in the case of the smaller ones. The practice of all the best insurance companies had established the principle that at least one-third of the amount of the annual premiums for any class of annual business should be set aside at the close of the year for unexpired risks, and all that his Amendment proposed was that, seeing it was impossible to ask existing companies to give the public the security of the large deposit laid down in the case of future companies, they should at least
<col>1054</col>
impose upon them the obligation of conducting their business, as far as life assurance was concerned, in accordance with what he might call the minimum requirements of sound business.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02498"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said that on the Second Reading of the Bill he had endeavoured to make clear to their Lordships the two great points the Government had in view with regard to security. The first was that of the deposit, which, as he had attempted to explain, was not really a security at all. It was only a sort of guarantee that at the time the company as formed it had a reasonable financial backing, but after it had attained a certain size the deposit ceased to be of very much use as a guarantee. What the Government relied on mainly after that was the publicity&#x2014;allowing people to see exactly the position of the company. They had studiously avoided laying down anything in the nature of a standard, and for that reason were unwilling to accept the Amendment. There was one reason in particular which made it very undesirable to set up any particular standard. If they accepted the noble Viscount's standard of thirty-three and one-third per cent., which might or might not be an ample margin, that would at once become the Government standard. He was advised that there were companies which made an even greater provision than that; but that would become the Government standard, and everybody would be entitled to say that they were conforming to the Government standard and there was no necessity for them to do anything else. In that way he thought that more harm than good would be done by any provision of this kind.</p>

<quote>34.&#x2014;(1) Amongst the purposes for which collecting societies and industrial assurance companies may issue policies of assurance there shall be included insuring money to be paid for the funeral expenses of a parent.</quote>
<quote>(2) No policy effected before the passing of this Act with a collecting society or industrial assurance company shall be deemed to be void by reason only that the person effecting the policy had not, at the time the policy was effected, an insurable interest in the life of the person assured, or that the name of the person interested, or for whose benefit or on whose account the policy was effected, was not inserted in the policy, or that the insurance was not one authorised by the Acts relating to friendly societies, if the policy was effected by or on account of a person who had at the time a bon&#x00E2; fide expectation that he would incur expenses in connection with the death or funeral of the assured, and if the sum assured is not unreasonable for the purpose of covering those expenses.</quote>

<quote>(4) In this section the expressions "collecting society" and "industrial assurance company" have the same meanings as in the Collecting Societies and Industrial Assurance Companies Act, 1896.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02515">The noble Viscount said that this was the first of the provisions in the Bill dealing with collecting societies and industrial assurance companies, and as such it raised a question which to his mind was far more important than any other dealt with by the Bill. The law as it at present stood
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0532"/>
<col>1057</col>
with regard to industrial assurance companies was that any person who desired to assure the life of another must have a pecuniary interest in the continued life of the person assured. Friendly societies doing the same business were governed by the Act of 1896, Section 5 of which provided that an assurance could only be for a sum payable on the death of a member of the society or for the funeral expenses of the husband, wife, or child of a member of the society. That was the law as it stood, but for many years past the provisions of that law had been regularly and continually broken and assurances had been effected by these industrial companies and friendly societies with a total disregard to those limitations of the law in cases where there had been no real interest of the person assuring in the person assured.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02516">Industrial assurance business had risen to a very large amount indeed. He believed that the figure was something like &#x00A3;35,000,000&#x2014;&#x00A3;26,000,000 by the companies and &#x00A3;9,000,000 by the friendly societies; and he was told that out of that amount something like &#x00A3;9,000,000 was absolutely illegal and that the assurances would be void because they were contrary to the provisions of the law. The Government had had their attention directed to this matter and had attempted to meet it by the provisions of this clause. What were those provisions? By the second subsection they proposed that no policy effected before the passing of this Bill with a collecting society or industrial assurance company should be deemed to be void by reason only that the person effecting the policy had not, at the time the policy was effected, an insurable interest in the life of the person assured, or that the name of the person interested, or for whose benefit or on whose account the policy was effected, was not inserted in the policy, or that the insurance was not one authorised by the Acts relating to friendly societies, if the policy was effected by or on account of a person who had at the time a <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> expectation that he would incur expenses in connection with the death or funeral of the assured, and if the sum assured was not unreasonable for the purpose of covering those expenses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02517">That provision was intended to legalise the illegalities of the past, at any rate to a certain extent, and he had no doubt it would do so to a very large extent indeed. But what was proposed with regard to
<col>1058</col>
the future? The Government proposed a much smaller extension of the existing law. They simply proposed that amongst the purposes for which the societies and companies might issue policies of assurance there should be included money to be paid for the funeral expenses of a parent. He contended that it was entirely illogical to legalise to so large an extent the illegal assurances of the past, and then to propose to Parliament to enact a law for the future which fell very short indeed of that. Why did they propose to legalise this illegal assurance? Because the law had never been enforced. Was it possible to enforce the law? That was a question to which he would very much like to have a reply from His Majesty's Government. If it were possible to enforce the law why had it not been enforced in the past? If it were not possible to enforce the law, what was the use of narrowing the law in the future beyond the point which they desired to legalise in respect of the past?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02518">There was another and a very serious side to this question&#x2014;namely, whether it was in the interest of the working classes themselves that Parliament should extend the powers of assurance for the past in the manner proposed by the Bill or for the future even to the narrow extent which was proposed. He was confident that those who were competent, in another place, to speak the mind of the industrial classes of the country on this subject would be able to tell some very unpleasant stories with respect to the operations of these friendly societies and industrial companies in this matter. He himself had the honour to serve a great many years ago on a Royal Commission which inquired into the working of friendly societies and the societies which transacted this assurance business. The chief of them, he remembered, were the Royal Liver, of Liverpool, and the Victoria Legal. It was not too much to say that those societies were then almost completely in the hands of their agents and collectors; that the business was transacted for the benefit of the collectors, who obtained enormous commissions, rather than for the benefit of the working classes who had insured; for after a time in many cases the assurances were allowed by the collectors to lapse, and the societies lived on the lapses while the collectors lived on their commissions. He might point to some very dark suggestions that were made at that time with regard
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0533"/>
<col>1059</col>
to the effect of industrial assurances of this kind on the duration of child life, but he hoped that had considerably improved. But there was a regular system with regard to these societies of collectors visiting the homes of the working class while the husbands were at work and persuading the women to insure the lives of persons not known to them, the policies in many cases being mere gambling transactions. The collectors extracted their commissions and in the end probably let the assurances lapse.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02519">He must say that in this matter His Majesty's Government were attempting to legislate without sufficient inquiry. He would venture humbly to suggest to them that before they attempted to deal with this subject by fresh legislation, whether it related to the past or to the future, they should institute a thorough inquiry into the working of these industrial assurance societies amongst the working classes, and ascertain, for the benefit of the public and for their own benefit, in what direction it would be best to legislate. He knew that the noble Lord would contend that for the sake of these policy holders who were unable to protect themselves these existing policies ought not to be void as they were legally void at the present moment. He was not much impressed by that, because no assurance company would venture to refuse to pay, however illegal the policy might be at law. They knew that to refuse to pay would do them infinite harm in their future business. He had placed an Amendment on the Paper for the purpose of providing that whatever was enacted for the past should be enacted for the future; but he would not care to press the Amendment against the Government. His present feeling was one of doubt whether industrial assurance under the present law was working really for the benefit of the working classes, and whether, on the contrary, it was not turned into a form of gambling, which, in this very session, with regard to marine insurance where there was no insurable interest, His Majesty's Government were doing their best to put down. He questioned, therefore, whether a much more general and wider consideration of the whole subject was not necessary before any legislation was proposed. His second Amendment was to omit from subsection (2) the words "before the passing of this Act," so that the subsection would apply to future as well as to past transactions;
<col>1060</col>
but he would first move his Amendment in subsection (1), which, if carried, would make the subsection read&#x2014;
<quote>"(1) Amongst the purposes for which collecting societies and industrial assurance companies may issue policies of assurance there shall he included insuring money to cover expenses to be paid or incurred in connection with the death or funeral of a parent."</quote></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02521"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said that, as the noble Viscount had pointed out, this was a very important point, and the noble Viscount had correctly stated what it was proposed to do by the two first subsections of the clause. The second subsection was a whitewashing subsection, and its object was to legalise transactions which were really at the present moment void in law&#x2014;that was to say, if they were disputed by the company or the society the claims could not be enforced under those policies. But there was something else which followed from that. He understood that it had been held that the money paid as premiums in consideration of these policies had been paid without consideration and was, therefore, recoverable, and there had been a number of actions brought for the recovery of these premiums. If the matter was allowed to stand as it was, and if they accepted the statement of the noble Viscount that no company or society would refuse to pay a claim, he thought that from the point of view of those organisations the position would be a very unfair one, because the holders of the policies would be in the glorious position that if they wished they could recover at law the premiums they had paid, and at the same time if a claim arose they would be sure to get it paid. He did not think that would be very fair, and therefore from the point of view of the companies and the societies there was a good deal to be said for this process of whitewashing. From the point of view of the people who had taken out the policies, he thought there was also a good deal to be said for it. There was a real danger, and he believed it had only been staved off by the fact of this Bill being before Parliament, that a run might take place upon these companies and societies with most disastrous results,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0534"/>
<col>1061</col>
and that many poor people would thereby lose perhaps the savings of a lifetime. He thought there were very sound reasons in favour of the course which the Government proposed. He had now dealt with the general point. With regard to the Amendment on the Paper, the noble Viscount proposed that the life of a parent should be insurable whether or not for the purpose of the payment of funeral expenses. The Government thought that the concession might well be made in the form in which they made it. It must often happen that a son would be put to expense in connection with his father's funeral, and they thought it not unreasonable that he should be allowed to insure against that expense. But the same reason did not exist if he was not to be put to that expense, and therefore they thought it right that the words should be limited as in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02522"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he had merely placed the Amendment on the Paper to make the legislation in future tally with the legislation proposed in respect of the past. The noble Lord had given no argument in favour of legislating in one manner for the past and in another manner for the future. He would like to hear why that was proposed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02523"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the Government did not think it at all desirable that this class of business should go on, and they intended to do their best to put a stop to it. They had been in communication with the collecting societies and industrial assurance companies who had carried on this class of business. These bodies had had a very great fright lately owing to the action s which had been brought, and the Government understood from them that if they could get them out of the hole they were undoubtedly in, they would put their house in order and would not carry on this class of business in future. He did not think it should be very difficult to see that in future the law was enforced. They had assurances that it would be observed. He did not disagree for a moment with what the noble Viscount had said as to the evils of this promiscuous assurance. It was the same as the P.P.I. insurance which was dealt with by a Bill now before their Lordships' House. He thought the argument in favour of the course proposed by the Government was that they were anxious to avert a panic. They did not intend in the least to condone such action
<col>1062</col>
in the future, and the only increase which they made was in allowing the life of a parent to be insured for the purpose of paying funeral expenses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02524"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said it ought to be remembered in this matter that these societies and companies had deliberately broken the law in the past for their own benefit, or rather collectors had broken it for their benefit, and, to some extent, for the benefit of the societies. He was not content to know that assurances had been given in their fright by persons who had broken the law in the past that they would be good boys in the future. What steps would the Government take to enforce the law in future? What penalty was imposed upon a breach of the law? From whom would that penalty be obtained&#x2014;from the collectors or the societies? What steps would be taken by the Government to enforce the law which they asked Parliament to enact?</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02525"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> imagined that the penalties contained in Clause 22 of the Bill, as amended, would be applicable in this case. It was there provided that any assurance company which made default in complying with any of the requirements of the Act should be liable to a penalty not exceeding &#x00A3;100, or, in the case of a continuing default, to a penalty not exceeding &#x00A3;50 for every day during which the default continued.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02526"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> pointed out that there had been penalties in the past for breaches of this kind, and the point was that nobody had attempted to enforce them. Would the Government enforce them in the future? That was the only way in which they would be enforced, for he did not believe the local authorities would take up the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02527"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said that if the provisions with regard to the enforcement of penalties were not sufficiently strong, the Government would be cite prepared to consider whether it was desirable that they should be strengthened.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02530"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said his next Amendment was rendered necessary in this way. The old process of transforming a friendly society into a company was for a general meeting to be held and a special resolution to be passed, that special resolution forming the basis of the memorandum of association of the new company. Under the machinery which it was proposed to set up by this Bill the transformation from a friendly society to a company might take place by application to the High Court. Therefore there would be no special resolution, and without the Amendment there would be nothing on which to found the memorandum of association.</p>

The Amendment was to leave out all the words from "except" to "deposited," the object being to secure that, when in the case of small fire insurance companies their funds were hypothecated in various countries, by the laws of which they could not be taken out of those countries, there should be a statement of that fact. It would then be seen how much of their funds remained for the security of policy holders in this country.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02557"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the reason the Government had differentiated in this Schedule between the case of life companies and companies carrying on what was known as short term business was exactly the same as he had already explained in regard to other points. They considered that in the case of these short term policies there was not the same reason for giving such an extent of protection as was necessary in other cases. A fire policy was an annual contract which might be terminated at the end of any year at the will of either party, and the same cautions were not considered necessary in that case as in

the case of the long-continuing risk of life companies.</p>

He asked on what day the Second Reading of the Housing and Town Planning Bill would be taken, and I suggested Thursday, September 16. I find that Thursday would be inconvenient for my noble friend the Lord Steward, who has an important engagement on that day, and I understand from him that noble Lords opposite have kindly agreed that the Bill should be taken on the Tuesday instead of the Thursday. I hope that will be convenient to the House. Although the Bill is long and complicated, its general principles are approved, and I think the closest discussion upon it is likely to take place in Committee rather than upon Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02633"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill of some considerable importance to the Civil Service, and therefore, I think, merits a few words of explanation. It is, I may say, the outcome of dissatisfaction that has been felt by Civil servants for some years past with regard to certain grievances caused by the working of the existing system of pensions. In 1903 a Commission, presided over by my noble friend Lord Courtney, inquired into this matter, and drew up a scheme which was eventually submitted to the Civil Service, and which, I may say in passing, appears to have received the approval of Mr. Austen Chamberlain when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. As I said, this scheme was submitted to the Civil Service, but for various reasons no definite result was arrived at till the year 1907, when a plebiscite was taken of Civil servants throughout the country by a body known as the Deferred Pay Committee, and this resulted in a majority for what is known as the Courtney scheme as against alternative schemes. This Bill really embodies, with certain modifications and alterations, the recommendations of the Commission presided over by my noble friend. A committee of actuaries was appointed by the Treasury, and they reported that they were able to recommend certain improvements in the scheme which would give better results for the men themselves than
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0541"/>
<col>1075</col>
the recommendations of Lord Courtney's Commission. This Bill was regarded as a non-contentious Bill in another place. Really all it does, or seeks to do, is to distribute in a slightly different way certain charges which appear annually on the Votes; and therefore I trust it may have a smooth and a rapid passage through this House. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02635"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that this Bill is the outcome of a long series of negotiations between His Majesty's Government and the 'members of the Civil Service, and that it has behind it the high weight of authority derived from a Commission presided over by Lord Courtney. Therefore I am quite prepared to regard the proposals contained in it as proposals which are virtually agreed to. But there is one which I must say seems to me so novel that I think a word of explanation with regard to it might be desirable&#x2014; I mean the proposal which is to be found in the sixth clause of the Bill. I interpret that clause as having this effect, that whereas until lately, at all events, it was usual to give, under the old Superannuation Acts, special compensation to members of the Civil Service whose office was abolished by the act of His Majesty's Government, that special allowance will no longer be given. The wording of the clause suggests that where the office held by a member of the Civil Service is abolished he will not be entitled to receive any compensation exceeding that which might be granted to him if he retired on the ground of ill-health. Now, my Lords, I must say that <i>prima facie</i> there seems to me to be all the difference in the world between the case of a man who, owing to his own misfortune, is obliged to retire from the service, and the case of another man whose retirement is imposed upon him by the action of the Government of the day. The second case is one certainly of exceptional hardship, and I am surprised that it should have been thought proper to deprive those Civil servants who are the sufferers from events of that kind of the special consideration which certainly in the time when I knew anything about these matters they used to receive. Perhaps some member of His Majesty's Government may kindly enlighten us on that point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02638">Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02639">Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Hamilton of Dalzell</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02640"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I make no apology to your Lordships for saying one of two words upon this stage of the Bill, because there were several details with which we did not deal on the Second Reading. Moreover, I understand that it is for the convenience of His Majesty's Government that I should raise one or two points at this stage rather than in Committee, especially as there are no Amendments on the Paper to the clauses to which I desire to advert. Clause 3 is in its nature to some extent an excrescence on the Bill. The remainder of the Bill has to do with the fixing of a minimum rate of wages in the special trades, but in Clause 3 a different provision is made under which a report may be called for from a Trade Board upon any matter with which the trade in question has to do. I do not say that that is, in itself, an objectionable clause, but as I do not think the noble Lord in charge of the Bill referred to it on the Second Reading I should like to ask to what kind of subject it is proposed to apply this power to demand a report. There is a certain anxiety felt amongst employers that this clause may be used in an inquisitorial manner, and that they may be called upon to disclose matters which in the course of their business they much prefer and which they are entitled to keep secret&#x2014;I mean things which have to do with secrets of the trade, which, of course, it is part of their interest to keep to themselves lest their rivals should take advantage of them. And your
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0542"/>
<col>1077</col>
Lordships will notice that under Clause 14 there is a general power to appoint officers to carry out the Bill when it becomes an Act. The words are very general, and it is thought that these officers would be invested under that clause with almost universal power to, if I may use a colloquial phrase, poke their noses into matters which do not concern them. I am sure that is not the intention of His Majesty's Government, but it would reassure public opinion if the noble Lord could make a statement as to the kind of topic which would be the subject of this report, and the kind of way in which this clause would be used.<lb/>
Then I have a word or two to say on a more important clause&#x2014;Clause 5. This is the clause which provides part of the machinery for carrying into effect the establishment of a minimum rate of wages. The provisions of the Bill are rather elaborate. In the first place, the Trade Board consider the question of the establishment of a minimum rate of wages and then give three months notice of their intention to fix a particular scale. Then, at the end of that three months, so far as the Trade Board are concerned, their resolution becomes absolute. But that is not the end of the matter. Then it passes to the Board of Trade, and the Board of Trade consider it, not for three months but for six months, and it is not until after the end of the six months that the minimum rate of wages becomes absolutely fixed and part of the law of the land. Now, my Lords, speaking without having heard what the Government have to say in defence of that arrangement, they will allow me to make the observation that it seems unduly clumsy. In order to fix the minimum rate of wages there has to be an interval of nine months, during which no one will know for certain what the rate of wages is going to be. Upon the face of it, any uncertainty in the rate of wages is a mistake, and I think the Government themselves are conscious of it, because there are certain other provisions inserted with the view of mitigating the effect of this long delay.<lb/>
In the first place, it is proposed that after the Trade Board have provisionally fixed the rate of wages although it shall not be absolutely the law of the land yet it shall have a certain validity. It shall have a validity wherever the Government employ a contractor&#x2014;employ an employer, if I may use the term. It shall also have a validity everywhere unless the employer
<col>1078</col>
and his workpeople come to a written agreement to the contrary. I am quite unable to see the advantage of such an arrangement. If the confirmation of the Board of Trade is necessary at all, it evidently implies a certain doubt on the part of the Government as to whether the Trade Board are entirely to be trusted; otherwise they would not make the provision at all. So that we must assume, without desiring in any way to derogate from the reputation of these Trade Boards, that as a matter of policy and prudence the Government do not trust them altogether, because if they did they would not propose a confirmation by the Board of Trade at all. If they do not trust them altogether it seems to me a very great mistake that the rate of wages should have any validity until it has been confirmed by the Board of Trade. There is no reason why, because a man is working for His Majesty's Government, he should have to pay a rate of wages in which the Government have not got complete trust.<lb/>
Then, again, there is the provision as to the written agreement. When you come to consider the class of workpeople who will have to come to these agreements, is it not obvious that anything in the nature of a written document is out of the question? It is absurd to expect these poor women to decide whether they ought to make a written agreement with their employers as to their rate of wages. Therefore the provision is, on the face of it, in need of very great defence. The Government are so conscious of the clumsiness of this interval of nine months before the rate of wages becomes definite that they have a most wonderful subsection in Clause 5&#x2014;subsection (4)&#x2014;which proposes that in certain cases, wherever they like, the Board of Trade can give a blank cheque to a Trade Board before they know what the rate of wages is which the Trade Board may arrive at. And not only are they to give this blank cheque to the Trade Board to come to any decision they like, but positively that power is given, not to an existing Trade Board, but to a Trade Board which is about to exist and of which they do not even know the constitution. That is a very remarkable provision, and it shows to what straits the Government were put in order to diminish the interval of time which they themselves have provided. Under this subsection the period is diminished from nine months to six months. I suggest to the Government that all this is a mistake,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0543"/>
<col>1079</col>
The time is too long. If we agree&#x2014;and we all agree&#x2014;that something in the nature of this Bill ought to be passed, surely the people interested can come to a conclusion in something under nine months; and if the three months notice of the Trade Board itself were left, as it ought to be left, the consideration of the Board of Trade should be diminished enormously&#x2014;it should be diminished certainly to three months; I think it could be diminished to one month. And in these circumstances the whole period for fixing a minimum rate of wages would be a much less formidable affair, and the advantage would accrue that not only would people get their minimum rate of wages at once but you would cut out of the Bill all these complicated provisions. I submit that that would be a far more workmanlike piece of legislation than the kind of compromise which His Majesty's Government propose. If the Government will be good enough, therefore, to enlighten us as to the meaning and effect of Clauses 3 and 5 I think your Lordships would be able to enter upon the Committee stage of this Bill with much more profit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02641"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must first of all thank the noble Marquess for having given me notice of his intention to raise these points, which are not dealt with by any Amendment on the Paper. First of all, with regard to Clause 3, that clause does not give any kind of compulsory powers to the Trade Boards. It merely states that they may be consulted by a Government Department if the Department wishes for any information regarding that particular trade, and I should have thought that quite a reasonable proposal. There is nothing inquisitorial in it, and I really think the noble Marquess's fears are without foundation. I will give an example of the sort of thing on which information might be asked for. Information might be sought regarding the amount of unemployment. That is a matter which would probably be within the knowledge of the members of the Trade Board, and one on which they could, I think, very rightly and usefully give information to a Government Department.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess criticised Clause 5. I know from what he told us on the Second Reading of the Bill that his criticism is in no way hostile. Indeed, the criticism is of a kind to which' we are not altogether accustomed on this side of
<col>1080</col>
the House. The noble Marquess criticises us because he thinks we are going too slowly. That is a great compliment to the Bill, and I am glad to think the noble Marquess regards our scheme as so perfect that it might be put into operation without a moment's delay. But, as the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition observed on the Second Reading, the Government are proceeding extremely cautiously in this matter, and if we have committed any fault at all it is certainly due to excess of caution and not to the reverse. But I do not think that in reality there is any excess of caution. The question which the noble Marquess raises really divides itself into two points. First, he asks whether the perod of six months between the fixing of the rate and the issue of the compulsory order is excessive, and then he asks what should be the position of the rate fixed by the Trade Board before such compulsory order is made.<lb/>
The first of these questions was very carefully considered. It is a matter which has been given, perhaps, more consideration than any other point in the Bill, and the conclusion arrived at was that the period of six months so far from being excessive was, if anything, the reverse&#x2014;that it was as short as it could be made. As the Bill was originally introduced provision was made for a longer period&#x2014;that is to say, at least six months was to elapse before the Board of Trade were to take the matter into consideration. Therefore the period occupied would probably have been eight or nine months at least; but eventually, as the result of inquiries and negotiations, the inclusive period of six months was arrived at. The object of this six months interval is not at all the same as the object of the three months notice which the Trade Board must give of its intention to fix the rate. That three months notice is to enable the Trade Board to hear objections to the rate. When, however, a rate is definitely fixed by a Trade Board the actual amount of the rate is final so far as the Board of Trade is concerned. It is not intended that the Board of Trade should revise a rate fixed by a Trade Board, but merely consider whether the circumstances of a case are such that it is inexpedient or premature to enforce that rate by legal compulsion on all employers and workers. In the opinion of the Government it is only fair to give some time before a compulsory
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0544"/>
<col>1081</col>
order is made, if only to enable employers to complete their contracts. That, I think, is a reason which will appeal to the noble Marquess as being a fair one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02642"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: But how does that fit in with the written agreement which must be come to between the workman and the employer?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02643"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: If the contracts have to be fulfilled I suppose that a written agreement would be entered into.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02644"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: A written agreement cannot be entered into unless the workpeople are willing. Therefore if the answer of the noble Lord is to be taken, the employer would be bound under contract to do certain things and the Government would have given him six months in order to do so, but when he comes to try his workpeople will not sign the agreement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02645"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: In that case he would not be able to enter into the agreement. He would have to make other arrangements. It is also necessary that the general attitude of the trade and the circumstances may be sufficiently known to enable the Board of Trade to judge of the expediency of making an order. If for the above purposes the period of six months is not excessive, and if at the expiration of that period the Board of Trade may further postpone the application of general compulsion, the question arises what should be the operation of the rate fixed in the meantime. It may, perhaps, be suggested&#x2014;and I think it is suggested by the noble Marquess&#x2014;that unless and until the rate is made legally obligatory on all it ought not to be recognised in any way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02646"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02647"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: There might be some plausibility in that contention if the Board of Trade were entrusted with the duty of revising the rate, but the Board of Trade is not entrusted with that duty; and it must be assumed that the rate is a fair one having been fixed by the Trade Board composed of representatives of the trade drawn both from employers and from
<col>1082</col>
employed. In the opinion of the Board of Trade, therefore, this rate, as soon as fixed, should become the minimum standard, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, between the parties to a wages contract, and, further, in the case of public contracts subject to the fair wages clause this rate should be at once recognised as the minimum standard of fair wages. In some cases Departments such as the War Office and the Post Office actually stipulate the minimum rates in their contracts, and we think it is right that the minimum rates fixed after exhaustive inquiry by the Trade Board should immediately become the standard minimum for purposes of contracts of this kind, independently of the question whether the Board of Trade have made a compulsory order applicable to all employers. That is a statement of the reasons on account of which we think it is necessary that this intermediate stage should be retained in the Bill, and I hope that they will satisfy the doubts which the noble Marquess has expressed on the subject.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02651">Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02652">Clause 4:</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02653"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved an Amendment providing that Trade Boards "shall as far as possible" fix general minimum rates of wages for piece work, instead of "may if they think fit." He said the policy of Clause 4 was to establish a time-rate of wages in every case, but a time-rate could never apply to home-workers or out-workers in whose behalf the Bill was really to be passed. The time-rate was only a step towards a piece-rate of wages. They began with a time-rate and then ascertained what an "ordinary" worker&#x2014;though what an "ordinary" worker was he could not conceive&#x2014;would do in the time, and, though it was not efficiently carried out in the proposal of the Government, that was what they conceived ought to be the piece-rate of wages. It was evident that wherever a piece-rate of wages could be fixed it ought to be fixed, because it was the piece-rate alone which protected
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0545"/>
<col>1083</col>
the home worker. The clause provided that the Trade Board must fix a time-rate, but might also, if they thought fit, fix a piece-rate. He quite agreed that there were conceivably cases when it might not be possible to fix a piece-rate because of the immense variety of the processes in the trade, but in the normal case where it was possible to fix a piece-rate it ought always to be done.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02655"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said he was compelled to resist the Amendment. The noble Marquess had said that piece-rates should invariably be fixed as well as time-rates. As the clause stood, it was provided that the Trade Boards must fix a time-rate, and might, if they thought necessary, fix a piece-rate. It might very often happen that it was unnecessary to fix a piece-rate. The processes might be so complex and might change so frequently that it would be really a waste of time to fix a piece-rate. He believed that this was particularly the case in certain parts of the tailoring trade which were liable to fluctuations of fashions. In such cases they did not think that the Trade Board should be compelled to fix a piece-rate, and that it was much better to leave the matter open and voluntary as in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02656"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am not quite sure that the noble Lord apprehends the exact purport of the Amendment. My noble friend does not suggest that the Board should be compelled to fix a piece-rate. We assume that you are to have a time-rate. It follows from that that, as far as possible, you should have a piece-rate which would correspond approximately with the time-rate, and therefore as far as possible my noble friend wishes a piece-rate as well as a time-rate to be fixed. Is the noble Lord in charge of the Bill really prepared to tell us that in cases where it is possible to fix a piece-rate it is not desirable to fix it? It seems to me that my noble friend's Amendment really tends to make the Bill more in accordance with the intention of the framers.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02657"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: Surely the noble Marquess who has just sat down has somewhat overstated his case. If what he said is to be taken literally, the Amendment of the noble Marquess would have no effect at all, because I understand him to say that the Amendment places no obligation on the fixing of a piece-rate further than those who have to fix it may think possible. Well, we assume that if they think it possible to fix a piece-rate they will do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02658"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Why assume that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02659"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Surely it is only reasonable. Where there is a demand for fixing a piece-rate and it can be done, we must assume that they will do it; but if they are to be left to be judges in their own case as to whether it is possible, the Amendment leaves the Bill where it stood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02660"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said it did not follow at all that the Trade Boards would fix minimum rates for piecework in every case, for the time-rate alone was quite sufficient for factory work. The Government, however, were dealing with trades in which there was competition between time work and home work, and the danger of the Bill was that they would favour the factory worker at the expense of the home worker and crush the latter out of existence altogether. The Trade Board might be dominated by factory workers and no piece-work rate might be fixed, or, if one was fixed, it might be so unsatisfactory as to concentrate work in the factories. It was very important that the piece-rate should be fixed at the very beginning, and if it could be done it surely ought to be done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02661"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>said that when the noble Marquess stated that the Trade Board might be dominated by representatives of factory workers who might wish to crush home workers out of existence, he had evidently forgotten that there was a provision in the Bill which was an adequate safeguard against such a danger. Supposing such a case existed, it would be equally to the advantage of the employer of the home workers that that work should be kept going.
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0546"/>
<col>1085</col>
If this work was brought to an end his business would also come to an end, and therefore it might be supposed that he would do his best to keep it going. Under Clause 4, subsection (5), he was entitled to apply to have a special minimum piece-rate fixed, and it might be presumed that he would come to the Trade Board and ask that a special minimum piece-rate should be fixed. Therefore if the Trade Board adopted the course which the noble Marquess anticipated the result would be that all these employers would be continually coming to them asking for special minimum piece-rates to be fixed for every one of the articles they manufactured. They would become so importunate that he thought that in the case of the most hard-hearted Trade Board, if such existed &#x2014;and he confessed that the noble Marquess's idea of Trade Boards differed materially from their own&#x2014;there would be no difficulty in getting a general piece-rate fixed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02662"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> hoped their Lordships would insist upon the Amendment. The refusal of the Government to accept it was as suspicious as it was unaccountable. What possible objection could there be to telling the Trade Boards that they were to do a certain thing if it was possible to do so, more particularly seeing that that certain thing was essential for the object of the Bill? The whole object of the Bill, as he understood it, was to carry out the recommendations of the Committee on Home Work,' and the whole of those recommendations were that the protection of Trade Boards and of minimum wages should be given to home workers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02663"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> said the Bill was a very novel experiment and it was better to proceed slowly. It would he thought be safer to leave the decision to the Trade Boards. He was afraid that the words proposed by Lord Salisbury would have an opposite effect to that intended. Lord Salisbury was wisely anxious to protect the home workers, but if their wages were fixed too high they might lose their employment. As the noble Lord in charge of the Bill had said, the tendency of the Trade Boards would be to fix those minimum rates of wages, but it was very difficult to fix the rate of wages for piecework done at home, and if the Board did not see their way to do that it did seem to him to be a rather dangerous experiment to put com-

He asked across the Table whether the Government intended that in every case the piece-rate should correspond exactly with the time-rate, and the noble Lord in charge of the Bill signified his assent. There was only one difference between his words and the words in the later clause, and that was that he used the word "average" instead of the word "ordinary." He hoped the Government would accept the word "average," for it was impossible to say what an "ordinary" workman was. Supposing, for instance, there were five categories of work-people, one earning 10<i>s</i>. in a given time, one 11<i>s</i>., one 12<i>s</i>., one 13<i>s</i>., and one 14<i>s</i>., and that there were about equal numbers in each category&#x2014;in that case which would be the ordinary worker? The phrase "ordinary worker" was not really capable of accurate interpretation. What the Government really meant was an average worker, and that was the phrase he ventured to use in his Amendment. The Act would have to be interpreted, not by a public Department, but by a magistrate. It was when the employer was alleged not to have paid the minimum rate of wages and was brought before the magistrate that the word would have to be interpreted. He could not conceive how a magistrate would interpret the word "ordinary" in this connection.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02677"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the noble Marquess had quoted him as having said on the previous stage that the minimum piece-rate would in every case be calculated on what an ordinary or average worker would be able to earn at the time-rate. He did not think he said in every case. At any rate, that was not his intention. That would be the standard which any sensible Trade Board would undoubtedly adopt and it was the standard adopted in a later part of the Bill, but they did not wish to fetter the judgment of the Trade Board. Though, as he had said, they believed that this would be the standard which would be adopted in fixing the piece-rate, they wished to leave the Trade Board a certain amount of elasticity. The noble Marquess was deeply interested in the welfare of the home worker. It might easily happen that in some exceptional cases it might be well to raise the wages of home workers gradually and not with a big jump. It was possible that they might be able to improve the conditions of home workers if they went very carefully and slowly to work, but if they compelled the Trade Board to adopt a hard-and-fast standard he thought there was a great danger of producing exactly the result which the noble Marquess feared. For that reason the Government preferred the slight elasticity given by the Bill. The point as to the difference between "average" and "ordinary" was dealt with by an Amendment standing in the name of Lord Ampthill in a later stage of the Bill.

He thought the adoption of this Amendment might possibly help to remove what might well be a difficulty in the working of the Bill. The success of the Bill would depend largely upon the cordial co-operation of the better class of employers with the authorities and with the representatives
<col>1090</col>
of the workers, and it was desirable to remove from the working of the Bill anything which could cause a legitimate sense of grievance on the part of the employers or put a genuine difficulty in their way. He thought any one who had studied the evidence given before the Committee on Home Work would see that the question of changing and secret patterns was one which was constantly referred to as representing a real difficulty. In many of the sweated trades, and certainly in one of the trades already included in the schedule, the number of these patterns was very great. Schedules of minimum piece-rates existed which included hundreds of them, and the framers of the Bill had undoubtedly taken this matter into consideration by the arrangements which they had made in order to enable special as distinct from general minimum piece-rates to be rapidly and easily fixed. Subsection (5) of Clause 4, especially provided for these, and their Lordships might also observe that in a later stage of the Bill it was provided that the district committees of the Trade Boards might deal with the case of special minimum piece-rates independently of the Boards themselves. That was, no doubt, rendered necessary by the frequent changes of patterns, and by the necessity of having some expeditious way of fixing rates of payment for them. That was well; but there remained this great difficulty, that in regard to these frequently-changing patterns, for each of which a piece-rate had to he fixed, there were a number the value of which consisted in their being secret, and if an employer who desired honestly to carry out the provisions of the Bill wished to get one of these special piece-rates fixed he was obliged to go to a body on which his competitors were represented and to give away the secret. That was a real hardship. It might be a real injustice even to the best of employers, and if there was any way of removing this difficulty without in the least injuring the interests of the workers they ought surely to adopt it. He did not for a moment pretend that the wording of his Amendment was the best way of meeting the difficulty, but the suggestion in his Amendment was that in these cases, where the whole value of the new pattern to an employer consisted in its secrecy, he should be able to go to some person who was not in the trade, and yet was a person whom all could trust, and get a special piece-rate fixed by that person. There were to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0549"/>
<col>1091</col>
be members of the Trade Boards appointed by the Board of Trade, and they would, no doubt, be persons of special experience who could be trusted&#x2014;men like Mr. George Askwith, whose experience and knowledge in these matters was as unrivalled as his sympathy with the workers was unquestionable. Therefore there would not be the least danger that these people, to whom the fixing of the special piece-rate was entrusted, would do anything injurious to the worker or anything calculated to hamper the operation of the Bill, and at the same time the employer would have protection. He hoped the Government would see their way to get over this difficulty by adopting his Amendment or by some other method.</p>

It was felt that a secret process would not be likely to be given out for home work. It would naturally be kept in the factory. The Government did not like the Amendment because it was a departure from the principle of the Bill that rates should be fixed by Trade Boards upon which employers and employed would be equally represented, and the responsibility should be with them. If the noble Viscount had in his mind any cases of special hardship and would confer with him, they would go into the matter and might arrange an Amendment for the next stage of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02687"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said the point of the Amendment was a very real one, and there was a great deal of evidence before the Select Committee bearing out what the noble Viscount had said. What the employers in these cases
<col>1092</col>
were afraid of was that they would have to expose to their rivals the trade patterns which they were about to bring out and which depended for their value on the fact that they were novelties and were not to be found in any other manufactory or works. The fact that there were on the Trade Boards other employers made the difficulty. He hoped that on reconsideration the Government would find themselves able to meet the noble Viscount to some extent at any rate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02688"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said it was not necessary, in the case of an employer who had a secret pattern, that he should apply for a special minimum piece-rate at all. If he had a factory he might carry on the manufacture in the factory, when the workers would come under the general time-rate but if the work had to be sent out, there was no necessity for him to have a minimum piece-rate fixed by the Trade Board. He could fix his own rate for the home workers, and all that he was asked to do by the Bill was to pay them such a rate as would not be less than they would receive if they were working on time work. As long as he complied with that provision there was no necessity for hint to apply for the fixing of a special minimum piece-rate. Therefore if an employer was afraid of giving information to his trade rivals it was to be presumed that he would follow that course.

<col>1095</col>
under this section. As the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition had pointed out during the debate on Second Reading, this was a departure from the ordinary provisions of the English Criminal Law, which required the prosecution in all cases to prove that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he was charged. He was aware that the reply made on behalf of the Government was that the only possible means of proof were the employer's books and records. That might be so, but he thought it should at least devolve upon the prosecution to establish before a magistrate that a breach of the Act had actually taken place before the onus of proving his innocence was thrown upon the employer. Incidentally this provision in the Bill threw a very serious burden on employers, who were very often in a small way and illiterate&#x2014;namely, that of keeping regular books and records of their business transactions; and in the circumstances it seemed to be very desirable that they should not be exposed to any further liability or responsibility than was necessary.</p>

As he had explained at the last stage of the Bill, this was one of those cases where they thought the onus of proof must be placed upon the defendant. He admitted that this procedure was a departure from the ordinary principles of law, but it was not an entire novelty. The noble Lord's proposal would, in fact, retransfer the onus of proof to the prosecution. It was easy to imagine what would happen in a case of this sort. The Trade Board would receive information that some employer was in the habit of paying less than the standard rate of wages, but it would be difficult to get proof of this. The work-people would be very reluctant to come forward. If the employer chose to keep books, and there was no apparent reason why he should not, he would at once be in a position to refute the charge against him. If he did not keep books, what would happen would be this. Some workman or workwoman, who was particularly bold, would come into Court and swear that he or she had been paid less than the standard
<col>1096</col>
rate of wages. On the other hand, there would be the evidence of the employer, who would swear that he had paid the standard rate of wages. It would be impossible in that case to obtain a conviction without a provision such as that in the Bill.

Though he agreed that an employer in a well-managed business should keep books, yet they were dealing with many very small people indeed. If the least reason was shown to the magistrate that there had been a breach of the Act the books would be at once called for. All that the Amendment provided was that before an employer was brought up on a criminal charge the prosecution should show a <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case against him. The moment the <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case was shown the proof would follow from the books, which would be produced by the magistrate's order. The real question was whether a man ought to be brought up on a criminal charge unless there was a <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case against him. That was one of the foundations of British liberty.</p>

He or she could not, I think, prove that in any way. It would be a bare assertion. Would that bare assertion be a <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case? If not, the effect would undoubtedly be to transfer the burden of proof to the worker affected. That is exactly what we do not want to do.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02718"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The point we are discussing is one which I ventured to lay some stress upon in the debate on the Second Reading, and therefore I do not like to desert my noble friend behind me while this conversation is in progress. A great many of us were shocked by the appearance of this Bill, because it certainly is so drafted as to suggest the idea to a lay reader that the employer in all these cases is to be presumed to be guilty until he has proved the contrary. That is a presumption which does not seem fair or reasonable; but, after hearing what has been said in regard to the particular formula of words which my noble friend has drafted in order to meet the point, I do think that he probably would be well advised not to press his Amendment. We are at rather a disadvantage this evening because what we are discussing is really a somewhat legal point, and neither of our Front Benches at this moment has the assistance of expert legal opinion. If my noble friend will not press his Amendment this evening and consider whether the matter should be further dealt with on Report, we might have another opportunity of discussing it.</membercontribution></p>

He was afraid this might appear to be a case of fools rushing in where angels feared

<col>1099</col>
to tread. It was quite evident to his mind, after reading the evidence given before the Home Work Committee and also this Bill, that there was a difficulty here which the framers of the Bill, though aware of it, had not seen their way to tackle. It might be impossible to find any form of words satisfactorily to get over the difficulty, and, as he had said in the case of a previous Amendment, he did not feel at all certain that the form of words he had devised was the best. But the difficulty was there, and unless something could be done he was afraid it would operate in many cases to prevent some of the most dependent of the home-workers from benefiting under the Bill. The difficulty to which he referred was that occasioned by the existence of the middleman or middlewoman. An employer might pay the minimum rate of wages, but through the intervention of an agent who deducted some part of the wages, the workers might not receive that which it was the intention of the Bill to secure for them. The suggestion had often been made, and he believed that in New Zealand it had been carried out by legislation, to suppress the middleman or middlewoman altogether. That suggestion was several times made before the Committee, but some of the most experienced of the witnesses, and certainly some of those who were not lacking in sympathy with the workers or in anxiety to see Trade Boards established, expressed the opinion that in many trades the middleman or middlewoman, if not absolutely essential, served a useful purpose, and could not be dispensed with under present conditions if home work was to go on. He would only quote one illustration&#x2014;that of the immense amount of time which would be lost to many workers if they were required to go to the factory and were kept there for hours in order to get the materials on which they were to work. If this loss of time was obviated by some person going round and distributing the work at the homes of the different workers, it was an immense benefit and worth paying something for. Therefore he did not think they could contemplate the suppression of the middleman altogether, but it was the presence of that intermediate agency which constituted the greatest danger to the successful working of the Bill. The ideal system would be that the employer who used the services of some one intermediate between himself and the actual worker, some distributor of the articles to be worked upon, should pay that person by a fixed com-
<col>1100</col>
mission or rate of wages, but it was impossible to legislate for that. As long as such persons existed it was necessary to take steps to secure for the actual workers the minimum rate of wages. He did not see how that could be done unless responsibility were fixed, not only upon employers, but upon the persons who actually made payments to the workers.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02723"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> hoped the noble Viscount would not press the Amendment. The point had received a great deal of attention from the framers of the Bill and in the course of the discussion in another place, and there had been the greatest anxiety to achieve the end which the noble Viscount had in view. But after long consideration it had been thought impossible to do more than was done by the Bill&#x2014;that was, to leave the word "employer" to be interpreted by the Courts according to the ordinary law. The introduction of the words of the Amendment would give rise to many anomalies. For instance, without some such limiting words as "by way of trade" the clause would cover a private person giving out materials to be made up. Then, again, the persons to whom payments were made or material given out might be agents of the employer and ought not to be liable. Again, there were employers who were paid by commission and who under the Amendment would be exempted. In some respects the Amendment was too wide, and in other respects it was too narrow. For instance, it would make a pay clerk an employer, and it would at the same time exclude any employer who was paid by commission.</p>

<col>1101</col>
the noble Viscount that the matter had received the closest attention, and it had been found absolutely necessary, in the interests of the working of the Bill, to leave it in the simple form in which it at present stood.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02726"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> thought Lord Milner would be very easily satisfied if he were satisfied with the reply he had just received. The noble Viscount had endeavoured to define employer in order to cover the case of the middleman. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill did not deny that the case of the middleman ought to be covered, but said that he and his advisers had not been able to find a satisfactory definition, and therefore he thought it was not advisable to define employer at all, but to leave the Courts to make what they could of it. He thought their Lordships would be better equipped in discussing this point if they knew what had passed in the House of Commons, but there were no reports of what took place in Grand Committee. Therefore, they had no resource but to bring this forward in their Lordships' House, and ask why it was that the Government had not attempted to cover the middleman. The Government having practically admitted that some kind of definition was necessary, he suggested that between now and the Report stage the noble Lord in charge of the Bill and his advisers should endeavour to frame some form of words which would cover the case of the middleman.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02727"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> urged that, if this question was left undealt with, most of the good which the Bill sought to promote would be undone. He could not help thinking that the point was capable of adjustment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02728"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> was of opinion that the objects which Lord Milner had in view were covered by Clause 9 of the Bill; but he would very much like to know what view the noble Lord in charge of the Bill took upon that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02729"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said he had carefully studied Clause 9 and could not see that it met the case he had in mind&#x2014;the case, a common one, of the party through whom the work passed making deductions from the wages by way of charges for his services. Clause 9 dealt with a totally different class of case&#x2014;namely, with the case of shop-
<col>1102</col>
keepers, dealers, or traders who, by way of trade, made any arrangement, express or implied, with any worker in pursuance of which the worker performed any work for which a minimum rate of wages had been fixed under this Act. He did not think the middleman or middlewoman distributor could be regarded as a shopkeeper, dealer, or trader. He was aware that the Board of Trade had done their best, as he was sure the Grand Committee of the House of Commons did their best, to tackle this most difficult question. But the result was not satisfactory, for, he was convinced, there was a very large number of cases which would not and could not be met by any interpretation of the word employer, and they would escape altogether. If the Government would seriously consider the matter, he would not press his Amendment now. He would, however, refer to the matter again on Report, and unless the Government could do something more satisfactory than they had done hitherto he should press this or some similar Amendment. He would rather make even his clumsy attempt to deal with the matter than leave it as it stood at present.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02730"><member>LORD BELPER</member> doubted whether the words which the noble Viscount had suggested would have the effect desired. The words in parentheses, "not being remunerated by a fixed rate of wages or commission" would exclude a large number of people and leave out those middlemen and middlewomen who made so much by giving a less wage than that allowed to them. A middleman remunerated by a fixed rate of wages or commission would not come under the term employer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02731"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> admitted that this was a very difficult point, but he did not think all the difficulties that some noble Lords had seen existed in it. It ought not in most cases to be difficult to say who was the actual employer. In some cases it would be the individual who had been alluded to as the middleman, and in other cases it would be his superior. He took it that what it would depend upon would be who was the person who actually fixed the rate of remuneration paid to the worker. It that was done by the superior employer, and if the man who actually gave out the work was paid by means of commission, then there would be no great difficulty in determining that the man who fixed the rate of wages was the man who would have to be dealt with if those wages
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0555"/>
<col>1103</col>
were too low. In other cases it would be held that the middleman who received a lump sum for the manufacture of the article and who fixed the remuneration for the person who actually did the work would be the employer. It was, however, a very difficult point. He quite appreciated the desire, of the noble Viscount that this important matter should be dealt with, and he would be happy to consult with the Board of Trade between now and the Report stage and see whether they could arrive at a form of words which their Lordships would consider satisfactory.</p>

by omitting the words "on behalf of the Crown." The meaning of the paragraph was somewhat obscure, but if this proviso was to be acted upon it was not at all clear why the suspensory power should only apply to Government Departments. Subsection (<i>c</i>) provided that no Government Department or local authority was to give a contract to an employer who had not expressed his willingness to pay the minimum rate of wages. Why, then, in this provision in case of public emergency, were the local authorities to be left out, and why was the suspensory power only to be applied to Government Departments?</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02740"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> desired before Clause 7 was added to the Bill to put a question to the Government. Their Lordships would remember that during the provisional state of things the minimum rate of wages applied under this Clause unless a written agreement was arrived at between the workpeople and the employer. The Government had explained, though he did not pretend to be satisfied with the explanation, that that ought to be so while the Board of Trade were considering whether to make the rate of wages compulsory or not. But the Bill went further than that. There was a power in a clause already passed under which the Board of Trade had authority to suspend the effect of the minimum rate of wages. They might prolong the period not only for six months, but for a further six months, and so on for ever if they liked. That must mean that for some reason or other the Board of Trade were convinced that the minimum rate of wages was premature, improper, or in some way objectionable. Yet this elaborate provision about agreements would apply, not merely during the first six months consideration, but after the six months consideration was over, and when the Board of Trade had resolved to suspend the matter <i>sine die</i>. Surely the Government could not intend that. The intermediate state of things continued and a written agreement was necessary between the workpeople and the employer if the minimum rate of wages was not to be enforced, and Government Departments were forbidden from employing a contractor who did not accord this provisional rate of wages. Had the Government considered that point? Did they intend that the provisions of Clause 7 should apply in the case of a suspensory order in the same way as they applied in the case of the first six months consideration by the Board of Trade?</p>

The Amendment was to substitute the words "an average worker" for the words an ordinary worker." He explained that in the first instance the object of the Amendment was that it should be consequential on the Amendment proposed by his noble friend below him, which he had hoped would have been accepted; but there was besides that a special reason for changing the word. The word "ordinary" meant nothing at all, whereas the word "average" implied that there had been some sort of calculation, which he ventured to think was assumed by the terms of this subsection.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02746"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> said the Government very much preferred the word "ordinary" to the word "average." It was quite true that the word "average" implied a calculation, the sort of calculation which the noble Marquess made when he mentioned the matter earlier in the evening. That was not a calculation which was very easy to make over a large trade employing many thousands of workers, and therefore it was probable that no accurate mathematical calculation of that sort would be made. Therefore the word "ordinary" would seen to be a more appropriate word to use in this place. There was another
<col>1106</col>
consideration which had weighed with the Government in selecting the word "ordinary"&#x2014;namely, that if the word "average" was used it might be possible for employers, in their own interests and so as to work up the average rate in the trade, to discharge all their slow workers and employ, for a time, at any rate, until the average had been arrived at, none but very quick workers and medium quick, and by that means raise the average to a point considerably above that which it ought to be. On the other hand, the Government considered that the ordinary worker was a person who was well known to everybody engaged in the trade, and that the speed at which these men would work would be easily arrived at by the technical members of the Trade Board. It was a term which would be understood by them and which would be more satisfactory in every way than the one proposed by the noble Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02747"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said the explanation that had been given seemed to him rather an odd one. The noble Lord had said that the word "average" a great deal of calculation, but that calculation he (Lord Camperdown) presumed would have to be made by the technical members of the Trade Board.

Supposing there were two sets of workmen of equal numbers, each set earning different amounts in the time. Which would be the ordinary workmen? The question was evidently not capable of an answer at all, whereas the average was quite easily arrived at. Then the noble Lord said the word "ordinary" would be interpreted by skilled workers on the Trade Board. It would, in the first instance, but it had to be arrived at by the magistrate. The magistrate was the person who had to determine it. It would be a question whether the employer paid the rate of wages which an ordinary workman would

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02751"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> submitted that there was a distinct difference between the two words. Take the case of ten persons. The average of those ten would be obtained by an accurate calculation. But it might happen that there were four or five abnormally quick people in the ten, or four or five abnormally slow people.

The objection to making it compulsory in every case that notice should be sent to a man who was supposed to have evaded the provisions as to the minimum rate of wages was that an employer might deliberately evade paying the minimum rate of wages until he received a communication from the Trade Board. He might do that deliberately and as a regular matter of business, and would chance the thing coming to the ears of the Trade Board. He might be one of the worst offenders in the district, but it would be impossible to get a conviction against him. He thought that would be very undesirable. Again, it might be possible, in the case of some small master tailors who existed, he believed, in the East End of London, that on receiving notice that the Trade Board were considering the matter they would at once flit, and again a prosecution would be impossible. Those were the reasons why the Government objected to making it imperative.

<quote>"(3) The representative members shall be elected or nominated, or partly elected and partly nominated as may be provided by the regulations, and in framing the regulations regard shall be had to the desirability of the representation of home workers on Trade Boards."</quote>
by omitting the words "regard shall be had to the desirability of," and inserting at the end of the subsection the words "shall in all cases be provided for." Under the Bill the regulations of which the noble Lord had just spoken were limited in certain respects. Among other things it was provided that there should be representative members elected or nominated, or partly elected and partly nominated as might be provided for, and these representative members were to be half representative of the employers and half representative of the workmen. As he had on several occasions pointed out, the workpeople included two categories&#x2014;factory workpeople and out-workers. He would not say that their interests were in conflict, but their interests were different. There was this further to be said, that this Bill was really brought in for the home workers. He did not mean that there were not difficulties with regard to factory workers which ought to be met, but the principal reason why they were taking all this trouble was to protect home workers; yet when they came to representation on the Trade Board the home workers were treated almost with disdain. There was hardly anything said about the representation of the home worker. The words were "regard shall be had to the desirability of the representation of home workers." That was a very sparing fulfilment of the obligations under which they stood to see that home workers were properly protected. He did not say that the home workers should have a majority of the representation, but he did think they ought in all cases to be represented. It was the central Trade Board itself that they were dealing with. The out-workers ought to be directly represented in some form on these Trade Boards. The only answer which he could conceive the Government making was that the out-workers consisted of people so poor and ill-educated that they might not be capable of sending representatives to the Board. If that were the answer he would point out that there was nothing in the Bill which required that the representatives were to be elected representatives. All that was called for was that persons should be placed on the Trade Boards who should have it in charge specially to represent the workpeople. The
<col>1112</col>
representative might be a lady of considerable education who took an interest in the subject, and who might be placed on the Trade Board with the special view of protecting the interests of out-workers. The words in the Bill were not nearly strong enough. He did not wish to insist upon the exact wording of his Amendment, but he submitted that something of the kind was necessary.</p>

<title>HOUSE LETTING AND RATING (SCOTLAND)<lb/> BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02826">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02827"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to ask your Lordships to read this Bill a second time, and I will very briefly explain its provisions. In the first place, it applies solely to Scotland, and deals with a question which hitherto has not been treated in the Party sense as controversial. The letting of houses in Scotland is not regulated by statute but by custom, but the help of Parliament is invoked on this occasion on account of the hardship which is felt by tenants of small houses in Scotland under the existing system. For twenty years, I should think, or snore, this question has been before Parliament in one form or another. Many Bills have been introduced by private Members in the House of Commons in the endeavour to deal with it, and some two years ago the present Government appointed a Committee to consider the question, which took evidence throughout Scotland upon the subject, and that evidence and the Report of that Committee are the foundation of the present Bill.<lb/>
The grievance is as follows. The existing practice in many of the large towns in Scotland is that in February intending tenants are asked to fill up a form which is in effect a binding agreement to enter upon a tenancy in May&#x2014;that is to say, four months notice is actually required before a tenant can secure the prospect of entering a house for a year. And the mention of a year brings me to the second part of the grievance, which is this&#x2014;that the tenancy of these houses by practice is for a year in Scotland. Scotland is peculiar in this respect. Long ago the conditions of house letting in England adjusted themselves to the more modern conditions of life and labour of the large working class population. Your Lordships will easily perceive how great a hardship it is to individuals of humble means&#x2014;mechanics, artisans, working men of all kinds, and even small shopkeepers&#x2014;to find themselves, no matter what change may occur in their circumstances, held and bound to the occupancy and to the payment of rent for the house for so long a period as twelve months. Not only is I the hardship felt keenly by working men,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0563"/>
<col>1119</col>
whose means fluctuate&#x2014;for instance, they may want a larger house or a smaller house, or a house in a different part of the town&#x2014;but it also operates very prejudicially as against the necessity which working men feel so keenly of following their trade from place to place. Shipbuilding may be slack in Glasgow and busy in Belfast. I have known cases of men on the Clyde who have had to pay rent for two houses while they have only been able to occupy the one in the place to which the necessity for seeking work has driven them. Therefore, this question, though the scope of it may not be very large, is extremely important to those who are concerned in it and at the same time difficult to deal with.<lb/>
In order to obtain the fullest information the Government moved deliberately and appointed a Committee, and the remedy they now propose I will briefly describe to the House. I will first deal with the definition of a small dwelling-house. In towns of over 50,000 population a small dwelling-house is defined as a house of &#x00A3;26 rent and under; in towns of between 10,000 and 50,000 population the limit of rent is &#x00A3;21 and under; and in towns of a population under 10,000 the limit of rent is &#x00A3;15. The Bill proposes that no agreement to take a house or to enter upon a tenancy of such a house as falls within the definitions I have given shall be binding which is of longer duration than two months&#x2014;that is to say, in future, to bring it down to a practical date, no February agreement shall be necessary to take a house in May, as is the present practice, and no agreement to take a house shall be binding if of a length greater than two months before the tenancy which begins at the expiration of those two months. That deals with the first difficulty and grievance&#x2014;the length of notice which practice has imposed on the tenants of these small houses.<lb/>
The second grievance is the excessive duration of the tenancy&#x2014;namely, twelve months. While the practice is one of yearly letting of houses, it is not the practice for the rent to be paid by the year. The rent is frequently paid half-yearly and even at shorter periods, and the Bill proposes that either the landlord or the tenant shall be entitled to give due notice of the termination of a tenancy on the next day upon which the rent becomes payable.
<col>1120</col>
Due notice is defined in the Bill, and it is longer or shorter according to the length of the tenancy. In tenancies which are longer than three months forty days notice must be given to terminate the agreement; in tenancies of less than three months, one-third of that period at least must be given as notice; and in the case of tenancies under one month at least five days notice must be given. But the Bill endeavours to limit the application of this provision to those who really require its protection. In the first place, all such classes of small houses below the rents I have specified that do not properly come within the category of dwelling-houses are excluded. Inns, hotels, houses which are let with agricultural or pastoral land, houses used in connection with land devoted to horticulture, market gardening, and so forth, are all excluded. Existing contracts are, of course, not interfered with, and, further, as well as the exclusion of, so to speak, individual classes of houses, the Bill recognises that in some of the towns in Scotland, notably in some of the smaller burghs, the provisions of this Bill will not be so widely used as in other towns. Therefore the Bill is adoptive. It comes under the category of Acts which may be adopted by burghs with a population of under 10,000.<lb/>
Then I may briefly mention two or three small changes proposed by the Bill. With the extended facilities which the Bill proposes to give to workmen to follow their occupation is given a limitation of the landlords' right of hypothec, by which the household bedding and the tools and implements of the workman, to the value of &#x00A3;10, are exempted from the landlords' right of hypothec. Then there are certain provisions in the case of house-owners in the direction of the protection of their property and interests. Access is given them to the Burgh Court; they are allowed to take such cases not only to the Sheriff Court but to the Burgh Court where such Court exists. If a tenant becomes seven days in arrear of rent, the house-owner is entitled to an ejection at forty-eight hours notice, and, further, the discretion of the sheriff is limited in the increase of that forty-eight hours notice to cases in which special cause is shown.<lb/>
There is one other important consequence of the provisions which I have
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0564"/>
<col>1121</col>
enumerated. It is this, that when this Act comes into force there must inevitably be, in the view of the Government, a change in the system of the collection of rates. People of small means naturally feel it a great hardship to have to pay their rates once a year in a lump sum. The evidence of the Committee goes to show that so great is that difficulty, so great a hardship is it felt by them, that they would even rather pay slightly more and have the privilege of paying their rates in instalments. Besides that difficulty there is this further one, that if during the year in any particular house there is a succession of tenants or even more than one tenant or occupier, under the present system under which the rate collector visits the house only once a year for the collection of rates, on his visit he would not find the man who is truly liable for the whole year's rates in occupancy of the house. There are two different ways of providing for what the Government consider an unavoidable change if this Bill is to be a practical measure. One method of dealing with, I will not say overcoming, this difficulty would be to impose upon municipalities the duty of making more frequent collection of rates. This has never hitherto been done in Scotland, and it would impose upon municipalities the necessity of employing a veritable army of rate collectors at great expense to the communities which they govern, and though the Committee did not give any very certain opinion on this particular point, when the subject is examined it is really found quite impracticable to adopt this suggestion. Indeed, in my judgment, and that of the Government, it is quite impossible to seek a remedy by any such means as imposing upon municipalities more frequent collection of rates.<lb/>
The other method of dealing with it is by extending the system of compounding. Under the system of compounding, as your Lordships are aware, the owner collects the rates and pays the rates over to the municipality, receiving an allowance, which in this Bill is to be fixed by the sheriff, for so doing. The tenant pays the rates with his rent. There is a special provision in this Bill, to which I shall allude in a moment, enacting that every tenant shall know when he is asked for his rent exactly what he is paying in rent and what he is paying in rates, though
<col>1122</col>
the two sums are paid together. Nobody likes compounding on its merits or as a matter of theory, but it has really been forced upon Parliament by the practical considerations to which I have alluded. Perhaps I may quote a short passage from the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation, presided over by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, which deals with this point. The words are these&#x2014;
<quote>"However desirable in principle it might be to abolish compounding, it is generally agreed that the practical defects of collecting and enforcing payment among a large number of the poorer classes of the large towns who are weekly tenants and are constantly moving from one tenancy to another are insuperable.''</quote>
The practice, I may further say, is general in England though it is not general in Scotland, but in regard to two rates it is the practice in Scotland. In respect of houses of a rental of &#x00A3;4 and under in Scotland both the county rate and the burgh rate come under this system of compounding.<lb/>
There are two objections made to the system of compounding. The first is that the tenant's sense of citizenship and responsibility is weakened because he does not actually himself pay the rates. We endeavour to mitigate any evil which may be anticipated to come from this source by the provision in the Bill to which I have alluded. In Clause 17 it is provided that every owner shall deliver to the occupier of a small dwelling-house at the beginning of an occupancy a receipt-book, rent-book, or certificate, stating the amount payable in name of rent and assessments to the owner and indicating separately on the basis of the last assessments for the time being the proportion thereof payable in name of assessments. The objection to any extension of the system of compounding is that in effect it would, by transferring the payment of poor rate from the tenant to the owner, relieve from disfranchisement as voters such small tenants as do not pay their rates. This at first may seem to some a formidable objection, but I would ask your Lordships to consider exactly the limits of it. In the case of tenants of houses of &#x00A3;4 and under this is the system in Scotland in respect of the burgh rate and the county rate, though it is not more general. If under this Bill you reverse that, you will <i>pro tanto</i> be going back, and, in fact, making the passage of this Bill penalise, so far as it goes, those tenants of small houses.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0565"/>
<col>1123</col>
Then I would remind your Lordships that under the Reform Act of 1832, tenants of houses of &#x00A3;10 yearly value and over exercise the franchise irrespective of the payment of rates. Therefore, the people with whom you are really dealing in this Bill, assuming your unwillingness to go back in regard to the &#x00A3;4 tenants and under are the tenants between &#x00A3;4 and &#x00A3;10, and how far do they receive privileges under this Bill which they do not otherwise receive? The &#x00A3;10 people are already exempt from any obligation to pay rates as a condition of their being placed on the voters' roll, and therefore we need not consider them in this matter. It has to be recollected that, after all, these men must and do live somewhere and they will pay their rents&#x2014;the large majority of them will live and pay rents somewhere. It would be visiting them with an excessive penalty if owing to the lapse of an occasional week, or month even, during the year they should be regarded as not having discharged as well as they could their obligations. I hope I have at not undue length mentioned the principal provisions of this Bill. I cannot believe that it will not meet in principle with your Lordships' approval, and, of course, I shall be prepared to deal in more detail with Committee points in Committee if the Bill should reach that stage.

The audience is not very large, certainly it is not very large on the other side of the House; but I can assure your Lordships that the number of noble Lords present is by no means in proportion to the interest which attaches to this Bill. The noble Lord himself, in his speech, appeared to me rather unduly modest. He said that the scope of this Bill was not large, and he made certain other depreciatory remarks, and being influenced, no doubt, like myself, by the hour, he curtailed his remarks and omitted a great many things that appear to me to require to be mentioned in connection with this Bill.<lb/> With regard to the object of the Bill itself, which is to prevent its being necessary that notice should be given as early as the month of February that you intend to take a hour in May&#x2014;so far as that goes, I do not think there is any difference of opinion. It was
<col>1124</col>
an arrangement made, not very wisely made, as I think, in their own interests, by the house-owners; but still, when we say that that arrangement is no longer to be made it is adding another to the innumerable interferences with free contract which is, I am sorry to say, characteristic of the age in which we live, and most especially characteristic of His Majesty's present Government. With regard also to the tenure, under this Bill it becomes impossible to have any let which extends up to a year, because, as the noble Lord said, simply by giving notice that on the next payment day the tenure will come to an end, the tenure thereby comes to an end whatever its nominal duration may be, provided always that certain notices, which cannot exceed, I think, forty days at the longest, are given. That, too, is a very great interference with freedom of contract, and I believe will be found in practice by no means convenient to a great many working men. That, again, I am not going to call in question, though I think it is a very unfortunate thing that it is found necessary to do this. Moreover, this is not really a grievance which is felt all over the towns in Scotland; it is especially a grievance of the west part of Scotland and more especially the City of Glasgow. As I have said, I do not propose to call those two matters in question.<lb/>
But I want to ask the noble Lord whether this Bill is not an entirely different Bill from the Bill which the Government introduced in April last. That Bill&#x2014;and this is one of the several things the noble Lord omitted to tell us&#x2014;was limited to &#x00A3;15. The houses were not to exceed the value of &#x00A3;15, and, besides that, the Bill might be adopted or not by any town in Scotland. Therefore the Bill of last April was a Bill wholly adoptive, and in any circumstances it was not to extend to houses beyond &#x00A3;15. The noble Lord told us that this Bill was prepared on the recommendations of the Committee. I assure him it is nothing of the kind. Did the Committee recommend that houses of &#x00A3;21 or &#x00A3;26 should be included? No. On the contrary, they said that the extreme figure to which you could go was &#x00A3;20. Just let me read what they did say. They stated, on the first page of their Report&#x2014;
<quote>"Even in Glasgow a rent of &#x00A3;16 would include probably four-fifths of the houses occupied by the ordinary working men, while in certain other towns that rent would include the houses of all the ordinary working men. Yet, looking to the rising
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0566"/>
<col>1125</col>
rents of working houses and to the convenience of a uniform standard, we have dealt with all houses up to &#x00A3;20 of rent as falling within our view."</quote>
Their Report was entirely limited to houses not exceeding &#x00A3;20 in rent, and &#x00A3;21 and &#x00A3;26 are excrescences for the existence of which no reason whatever has been given to us. As the noble Lord has told us, this Bill is now compulsory on all burghs which exceed a population of 10,000. That, again, is a most important difference. It is only adoptive as relates to burghs below 10,000. The noble Lord omitted to mention this great alteration. But how has this Bill been altered, why has it been altered, and when was it altered? This Bill was read a second time in its original form in the other House, and in Grand Committee the Lord Advocate appeared one day with Clause 2 as it now stands and inserted it in the Bill. The inconvenience of the procedure in Grand Committee has been mentioned to your Lordships already once this evening. Here is another instance of it. Nobody knows what goes on in Grand Committee, and on this particular occasion, so I am informed, no reason whatever was given to the Committee for making the change. Is the noble Lord aware that nearly all the burghs in Scotland are opposed to this?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02830"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Opposed to the Bill?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02832"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: No, I am not aware of anything of the kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02833"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I am very much surprised to hear that the noble Lord is not aware of it, because I think almost every other. Scotsman in this House is aware of it. I have here a petition from the City of Edinburgh, which I will take this opportunity of presenting to your Lordships' House, against it. They protest against the Bill for a variety of reasons. They say, first, that the maximum limit of &#x00A3;26 is excessive and ought to be restricted to &#x00A3;15; secondly, that the compounding clauses are not necessary to the attainment of the purpose of the Bill; thirdly, that under Clauses 12 to 17 the petitioners would require to levy and recover from owners burgh assessments properly chargeable against occupiers and pay to owners the commission fixed by the sheriff; and, fourthly, that this would increase the
<col>1126</col>
burden on the occupiers without any compensating advantage. The way they prove that is this, that any compounding allowance such as is given under the Bill to owners, the amount of which so far as experience goes has not been less than fifteen per cent., will fall to be met by the general ratepayers; and in Edinburgh, so the petitioners state, it would mean, at fifteen per cent., the sum of &#x00A3;12,000, or, in other words, an additional penny on the rates. They state that the system of compounding is open to objection, and that the compounding clauses in the Bill would have an indirect effect on the voters' roll.<lb/>
If it were not so late, I would enlarge upon these matters. But here is the City of Edinburgh petitioning your Lordships' House against this Bill. The Convention of Royal Burghs is opposed to it. I myself have received within the last four or five days letters from several large towns&#x2014;from Perth, Ayr, and other towns. The Convention of Royal Burghs sent out a circular-letter shortly after this alteration was made in the Bill, and the answers, I think I may say without exception, were entirely unfavourable to the Bill. Have the Government who altered their Bill given the burghs any opportunity of stating their case? Did they give them any opportunity of stating their case before the alteration was made, and at whose instance was the alteration made? It is said that it was done at the instance of certain members of Parliament; but did those members, supposing that that was so, consult their burghs? At all events, no opportunity was given to the burghs of stating their case against the Bill. The noble Lord stated that the Bill proceeded on the Report of the Royal Commission. I can assure him he is quite mistaken. He went even so far as to say that the Local Taxation Commission rather approved of this proposal of compounding. I do not think that was quite a fair interpretation of the words which the Commission used. The Commission stated that they disapproved fully of the principle of compounding, but they added that in certain cases it might not be necessary to abolish it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02834"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will see, on reference to the notes which were taken of the words I uttered, that I quoted an extract from the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation and left it to stand for itself.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0567"/>
<col>1127</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02835"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord did quote the words as they stood, but he omitted to quote other important words. The Commission also stated&#x2014;
<quote>"It is most desirable that all classes of the community should, as far as possible, be made liable to personal payment of rates in order that they may appreciate directly the effect of economical or extravagant administration."</quote>
As we are on this subject, let me tell your Lordships that the Royal Commission on the Poor Law have reported in the strongest terms against compounding. The noble Lord, in his speech, did all he could to minimise the effect of this placing of the rates upon owners. I wonder whether he is aware that in Glasgow&#x2014;I take his instance of Glasgow&#x2014;the action of making owners pay all the rates on houses up to &#x00A3;26 will have this effect. Out of 175,000 houses nearly 160,000 will be compounded for; in other words, the owners will be made rate collectors for all the rates except in respect of 15,000 houses. The noble Lord might, at all events, have informed us of the enormous change which he was proposing to make. With regard to placing occupiers on the register, is he aware that under this Bill an occupier can easily get on the municipal register without paying rates to anybody? It is not merely direct payment of rates. Supposing that the owner does pay the rates, and then the occupier does not pay him. In that case the occupier is on the register although he has not paid his rates. A state of things like that, it seems to me, is very undesirable.<lb/>
At this hour of the evening I am not going to protract my remarks, but I must point out to the noble Lord that this Bill will require very serious and thorough examination in Committee, and I hope he will give us plenty of time. I believe that the representatives of various towns are in London at the present time. I hope they will go and sec the noble Lord. At all events, they have made representations to many members of your Lordships' House; and when we are in Committee I hope the noble Lord will give us information as to why the scope of his Bill was altered, and inform us at whose instigation the alteration was made, and whether the burghs who object to it had any opportunity of stating their case.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1128</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02836"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose, to detain your Lordships long, but I must say a word or two in support of what has fallen from my noble friend Lord Camperdown. He has very fully stated the case. The Convention of Royal Burghs represents every royal, police, and other burgh in the whole of Scotland with the exception of one small burgh in the North&#x2014;I do not know the name of it&#x2014;and the whole of these burghs are unanimous against many of the clauses of this Bill. That is clearly stated in the Memorandum of the Convention. Besides that, I have a considerable number of memoranda from towns and burghs in Scotland, and they all, without exception, endorse the statements made in the Memorandum of the Convention of Burghs. The Convention not only represents the whole of the burghs in Scotland, but also a population of 2,918,000, which is a very considerable proportion of the inhabitants of Scotland.<lb/>
There are one or two things which, late though it is, I would like to say regarding this Bill. I will state to the House what the effect of such a measure as this would be upon the rates of the burgh of Ayr. There are 5,531 houses at a rental under &#x00A3;21; of these 674 houses are between &#x00A3;15 10<i>s</i>. and &#x00A3;21, the total valuation of these being &#x00A3;11,932. The assessments on these houses are &#x00A3;2,349, and the rebatements to occupiers through inability to pay are &#x00A3;30, and arrears of rates, for the same year, &#x00A3;24. This Bill makes provision for rebatements to owners in respect of their paying the tenants' rates. LA us take that at fifteen per cent. The loss to the burgh on the houses between &#x00A3;15 10<i>s</i>. and &#x00A3;20 at their present valuation would be &#x00A3;352, as against &#x00A3;30, plus &#x00A3;24, now. If we take houses under &#x00A3;15 and deduct fifteen per cent. allowed to the owners, there would be no real gain whatever. In England I believe the rebatement allowed to owners is twenty-five per cent. If the same percentage were given in Scotland, the loss to the rates would be infinitely greater, and this would have to be made up by those who would not benefit by the Bill.<lb/>
The whole of the burghs from which I have heard and also the Convention object to the clauses which enfranchise those who do not pay the rates. I believe that Scotsmen are quite proud of paying their rates direct, of knowing what they have to pay, and of having the franchise as a result of paying
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0568"/>
<col>1129</col>
their rates, and they would be very loath, I think, to the provision in the Bill passing into law. On the municipal voters' list in Ayr in the year 1908&#x2013;9 there were 5,357 persons with rents up to &#x00A3;21, and there were 1,009 who did not possess votes because they were in arrear and did not pay their rates. This Bill would, therefore, give an addition of nineteen per cent. to the voters. I think there is a great deal in the Bill which will most certainly need careful consideration and amendment, and I hope your Lordships will assist us in amending the Bill when it gets into Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02837"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to add a few words. I am afraid that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill will consider that it has not received a hearty welcome from us. I have sympathy with the main object of the Bill&#x2014;namely, the alteration of the period for which houses can be let. I have no doubt this period in the past has been inconveniently and unpleasantly long. I gather that that has always been the main object of the Bill, and I think it is very unfortunate that the Government should have wandered so far away from that object in bringing in the highly contentious and mast objectionable features of compounding for rates, which have received from us and from most people in the country the very strongest opposition. The noble Lord himself, in introducing the Bill, remarked that he and others were strongly opposed to the principle, but he said that in altering the period of letting it was necessary to alter also the incidence of rate collection. More frequent collection could not, he said, be placed upon the local authority on account of the labour and cost which would be involved, and so he quietly places the cost and labour upon the owners of the houses. Under the Bill the labour is now placed upon the owners of the houses to collect these rates&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02838"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: For which they will receive an allowance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02839"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: As this loss is to be made up to the owners, what reason is there why the local authority should not undertake the work themselves? They have their experts in rate collecting. I will not say any more at this stage, but I trust that your Lordships will, in Committee, show that you are strongly opposed to any extension of this system of compounding.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1130</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02840"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: MY Lords, I do not think that any of my noble friends who have criticised the Bill from this side of the House desire to dissuade your Lordships from giving it a Second Reading this evening, and therefore it is not necessary for me to detain you for more than a moment. The Bill certainly contains some provisions which at first sight appear to be of a startling description. At the same time I have no doubt that the noble Lord who introduced it is perfectly correct when he tells us that there is in Scotland what has been felt as a longstanding grievance with regard to the terms upon which house property of the kind which is desired by the working classes can be let in the present condition of the law. There is, I understand, a general desire that what I think is spoken of as the letting season should be shortened, and I understand that that desire is regarded as a reasonable one by most people. But I confess that when in order to meet this grievance, we are told that the owner of a house rented at &#x00A3;26 a year is to be deprived of the power of letting that house to a willing hirer for a period of a year, and that he is also deprived of the power of entering into an arrangement with his tenant three or four months beforehand in order to bring about such a transaction, that does seem to me to be, on the face of it, a somewhat extraordinary proposal, and I think my noble friend, Lord Camper-down, was perfectly justified in reminding the House that this limit of &#x00A3;26 which we now find in the Bill in regard to the larger burghs is really an afterthought, and that the Bill as originally introduced by His Majesty's Government suggested a limit, not of &#x00A3;26, but of &#x00A3;15. There is another very important change which the Bill has undergone since it was first put forward by His Majesty's Government. In its original shape it was, unless I am mistaken, adoptive in the case of all burghs. It now becomes compulsory in the case of the larger burghs. I think it is likely that when we arrive at the Committee stage attention will be particularly directed to those parts of the Bill which deal with the question of compounding for rates. I have heard several debates in this House on the subject of compounding. We had an important debate in 1906, and again, I think, last year, and on all those occasions I have heard it laid down by those most competent to speak on the subject, and by no one with more authority than my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn, that compounding was, in
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0569"/>
<col>1131</col>
principle, a vicious system, and that every attempt should be made to minimise the evils of that system. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill quoted the authority of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation, presided over by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, and my noble friend, Lord Camperdown, I think rightly, objected that the quotation really hardly did justice to Lord Balfour's views. May I remind the noble Lord, because my noble friend did not take the point, that Lord Balfour's Commission although admitting the great difficulty of collecting and enforcing the payment of rates, made that observation with regard to the members of the "poorest classes"? I am not at all sure that the Commission had in their mind when they used those words persons inhabiting houses for which a rent of no less than &#x00A3;26 a year is paid. That is not all. The Commission went on to add that the witnesses who had expressed this opinion with regard to the difficulty of getting rid of commutation all considered that the adoption of the system of compounding should remain optional with the local authorities. But here is a Bill which, far from making it optional, makes it, unless I misunderstand the scheme of the Bill, compulsory in the case of these burghs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02841"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I fully acknowledge the objections in theory to compounding, and my purpose in quoting the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation was to show that the difficulties which we had to meet in this Bill were practical difficulties which the Royal Commission acknowledged to be great.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02842"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My reading of the Report of the Royal Commission was that they pointed out the difficulty of getting rid of compounding, but this Bill creates compounding where it does not exist at present. The noble Lord referred to the fact that compounding prevails in England. So it does. It also prevails in certain cases in Scotland, but the fact of the system existing in those cases does not seem to me a sufficient reason for creating the system anew where it does not
<col>1132</col>
exist. The reason for creating it is that the local authorities will find it very troublesome to collect rates from these small householders. I have no doubt they will. That is a serious argument; but I do ask the noble Lord to set against that argument the much greater evils which I believe are due to the existence of compounding where you find it. So long as you have compounding, so long will the people who pay the rates in this country really fail to appreciate the great danger to which as a nation we are liable from the steady growth, the inordinate growth, of the rates; and I think that is an argument which in these days of municipal extravagance we cannot sufficiently lay to heart. There remains the point also made by my noble friend, that this Bill, although it comes to us ostensibly as a Bill intended to meet a grievance felt in many parts of Scotland, is, unless I am misinformed, opposed tooth and nail by some of the most important burghs. But these are all matters which we can bring up in Committee, and I really only rose because I thought it due to the noble Lord to warn him that these points were likely to be seriously taken at a further stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02868"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a small Bill to which His Majesty's Government hope your Lordships will give a Second Reading and allow to pass without very serious alteration. The subject has come under your Lordships' notice before. Three years ago the London County Council wished to have powers to establish and maintain a really efficient ambulance service for the use of the citizens of London in the event of street accidents. The clauses, after examination by a Committee of the other House, passed through satisfactorily, but a Committee of your Lordships, presided over, I think, by Lord Camperdown, rejected these particular clauses. The Home Office appointed a Departmental Committee which went into the whole question and took a large amount of evidence, and this Bill is founded largely upon their Report.<lb/>
There is some question of a difference of opinion, to which correspondence in <i>The Times</i> in the last day or two may have called the attention of your Lordships, as to whether the London County Council or the Metropolitan Asylums Board is the proper authority to undertake this work. The position of the Home Office is this: There is an urgent need for the establishment of a good ambulance service in London, but in the opinion of the Home Office it would not be possible for the Metropolitan Asylums Board to undertake that duty now, and there is some fear that the public at any rate would imagine that the ambulance of the Metropolitan Asylums Board was liable to infection as it is the authority charged with the removal of scarlet fever and other infectious illnesses. It is very desirable that nobody should have any suspicion that there was a risk of getting an illness if these street ambulances were used. The London County Council would probably be able to use a certain amount of land and a certain number of stations perhaps, and altogether, in the opinion of the Home Office, they are the proper authority to undertake the work. An Amendment in the Standing Committee of another place to the effect that it should be done by the Metropolitan Asylums Board was defeated by twenty-eight votes

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02870"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I regret very much the absence of my noble friend Lord Midleton, who, being a prominent member of the London County Council, is very much interested in this question; but in his absence I have been asked very briefly to explain to your Lordships the view the London County Council take with reference to this Bill. I think it is agreed on all sides that the present provision is inadequate and that something ought to be done. That fact has been recognised, I think, on all sides for a considerable time, culminating in the appointment of a Home Office Departmental Committee to which the noble Earl has referred. The noble Earl says that this Bill is founded very largely upon the recommendations of that Committee. I am instructed that this Bill is contrary to the recommendations of the Committee, and that what happened was that whereas the Committee recommended that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be the ambulance authority for London there was, if I may use the phrase in this connection, a Minority Report, or, at any rate, a Minority Memorandum, from Sir William Collins, the author of this Bill, in which he differed from his colleagues, and advocated practically the system which is outlined in this Bill. I am desired to say that the London County Council still generally adhere to the views expressed in the Report of the Committee, and they consequently do not like the Bill as it now stands. They think the system proposed by the Committee would be a better one than that proposed by this Bill, and it would certainly be more economical that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be the ambulance authority for London and not the County Council. At the same time they feel that this is a matter of some urgency and they would be very sorry indeed to see any delay in dealing with it. Therefore, I have been asked not to offer any opposition to the Bill at this stage, but to give notice that when the proper time comes in Committee an Amendment will be submitted to your Lordships so as to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0572"/>
<col>1137</col>
enable the London County Council to enter into an arrangement with the Metropolitan Asylums Board which will have as its object the utilisation and preservation of existing facilities, subject, of course, to the consent of the Local Government Board. Notice will be given of the Amendment, and I hope your Lordships will agree to it when the proper time comes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02871"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is quite correct, as the noble Earl has stated, that this matter was before this House about three years ago, that it was referred to a Committee of your Lordships' House, and that I served on that Committee. At that time the Home Office was opposed to the London County Council being the body, and, if my recollection rightly serves me, the representatives of the police gave evidence, and I think there was official evidence also from the Home Office to the effect that they thought it better that this matter should be in the hands of the Police. Well, my Lords, since that time, for whatever reason, the Home Office appear to have changed their minds. I dare say if they had told us at that time that they were in favour of the County Council being the authority no doubt we should have given every consideration to official evidence of that sort. The evidence which we received from the Home Office naturally had a good deal to do with our conclusion, but if the Home Office have now altered their minds and wish the County Council to be the authority I am sure no members of that Committee wish to press upon the House the opinion which they formed at that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02872"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the London County Council from time to time have been accused of megalomania, and I am bound to say that at the time when I had the honour of being a member of that body I often had to take exception to the desire expressed to have more work put upon them; but I think the County Council have now come to the conclusion that they have quite as much to do as they can possibly manage. At the same time, as the saying goes, somebody must do these little things. It is quite clear that the Home Office, representing as it does the Police, is not prepared to undertake the work of providing ambulances in London, which to my mind would certainly be the best course; but if it is not prepared to do this and the London County Council
<col>1138</col>
are willing to have this duty put upon them, I for one believe that they will discharge it with perfect efficiency. Whatever may be the faults of the London County Council, nobody can deny that their administration of parks and various other matters into which, fortunately, political controversies do not enter, is very admirable, and I earnestly hope, therefore, that your Lordships will not allow another session to pass without using the only opportunity which apparently presents itself of providing an efficient ambulance service for London.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02873"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can quite confirm what has fallen from the noble Earl behind me with regard to the change of front of the Home Office as to this Bill. In fact the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, in this House called it a revolutionary change to which the Home Office was not prepared to consent. Well, my Lords, the Home Office has changed its mind and may be right, but as a member of the Committee I should like to ask for an assurance from the Home Office on one point. I think one of the points that influenced the minds of the Select Committee of your Lordships' House over which the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, presided, was the danger to the public. When a man is knocked down in the street the person who must pick him up is the policeman. The County Council are not a police authority. The City of London and most Corporations are police authorities, and, therefore, before this Bill is read a second time I think your Lordships should have some assurance from the noble Earl who represents the Home Office that some thoroughly good working arrangement has been arrived at between the Home Office and the London County Council, so that those disabled in the streets will not lack assistance from the police, who are in a great number of cases competent to give first aid to the injured.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02874"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: May I with your Lordships' permission, call the noble Earl's attention to one matter which I omitted when I was speaking. In Clause 1, subsection (3), it is proposed to give power to acquire any lands or buildings in the county. Does that mean by agreement or by compulsion? If it is the latter, there are no words in the Bill and no procedure proposed anywhere in the Bill by which compulsory purchase could be carried out. If the noble Earl means only by agreement
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0573"/>

I think it would be necessary to put words in the Bill when we are in Committee.</membercontribution></p>

It seems to be agreed on all hands that accidents have increased, and that the time has come to take action. As regards the Metropolitan Asylums Board, it may be mentioned that their stations are not in the centre of London but on the outside, and therefore are not adapted to the work required. Fresh stations would have to be acquired if the Metropolitan Asylums Board undertook the work.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02879"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is another small Bill promoted by the Home Office, and the purport of which, I think, is sufficiently explained by the two clauses in the Bill and the schedule which follows. The Workmen's Compensation Act makes no distinction at all with regard to the nationality of the workmen who suffer injury from accidents occurring in the course of their employment in this country. Foreigners and Englishmen have an equal right under the Act. In a good many Continental countries the same principle has been adopted, but in France at the present time British and other foreign workmen are under certain disabilities in the matter of compensation as compared with French workmen. The French Government, however, have power under their law by Treaty to remove these disabilities, and soon after the passing of the Workmen's Compensation Act negotiations were opened with the French Government to ascertain whether they would be willing to conclude a Treaty on these lines. The French Government received these proposals favourably, and the outcome of the negotiations which took place is the Bill now before your Lordships. I think your Lordships will see that, though the matter looked at by itself is not a very important one&#x2014;the total number of workmen who are likely to be
<col>1140</col>
concerned is very small &#x2014;on the other hand the Convention may be looked upon as being of real importance and value as a precedent, leading, perhaps, to other industrial agreements with foreign countries in time to come.

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02883">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02884"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to begin what I have to say by making my acknowledgments to noble Lords opposite who allowed me to put this Bill down for Second Reading to-day. I hope that we may arrange together for some satisfactory day on which to take the Committee stage, because I think it is not unlikely that various important Amendments will be proposed from various parts of the House, and I am sure it would be the wish of your Lordships that plenty of time should be given to the consideration of these Amendments from whatever part of the House they come.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, with regard to this Bill, I think it is only fair to admit at once that it has not received during the present session of Parliament any very lengthy consideration at the hands of the House of Commons. The Bill, as your Lordships know, was somewhat summarily dealt with in another place; but at the same time I must ask your Lordships to remember that this is really the same Bill as that which was considered last year by a Standing Committee of another place, and that that Standing Committee held no fewer than twenty-three sittings. They went into it very fully, and were able to consider it without the use of the closure, and this Bill is the result of very long and careful examination by a body which certainly contained a number of experts upon this subject. Not only was there the Standing Committee of last year, but the original frame of this Bill was submitted
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0574"/>
<col>1141</col>
to a Select Committee of the other House when the Bill was first introduced in 1906. That Committee produced a very valuable Report which I have no doubt is within the knowledge of all your Lordships who take an interest in this subject. Therefore we may fairly say that this subject has been before Parliament for the last three years and has received at the hands of the House of Commons a considerable amount of attention.<lb/>
Your Lordships will see that this Bill is divided practically into three parts. The fourth part we may dismiss as being supplementary, and, if your Lordships will allow me, I will take Parts II and III first because they are not likely to give rise to so much controversy as Part I. The first clause of Part III&#x2014;namely, Clause 68&#x2014;enjoins the appointment of a medical officer of health by each county council. In subsection (5) your Lordships will see the very important provision which affects their appointment. They are to be removable by the county council with the consent of the Local Government Board and not otherwise, and they are not to be appointed for a limited period. Those of your Lordships who have practical experience of the administration of the various sanitary provisions in different Acts of Parliament must know the difficulty which frequently arises when medical officers of health or sanitary inspectors are expected to deal with property belonging to the members of the body which appoints them. It is, I am sure, within the knowledge of everybody who has had anything to do with local government under those circumstances that it is almost unfair to expect a medical officer of health or a sanitary inspector to report very adversely upon property, however bad it may be, if it is possible within the next twelve months that this adverse report will be succeeded by his dismissal from office. It is an unfair position in which to put a medical officer of health, and this demand that he should be irremovable is one that has been made for a long time by a very large number of people.<lb/>
The next important clause is Clause 71, by which every county council is obliged to establish a public health and housing committee, to which the council may delegate any of their powers as respects public health and housing as they think fit, with the exception of raising a
<col>1142</col>
rate or borrowing money. Your Lordships will see that that will secure throughout the country the appointment of committees charged with the specific duty of looking after public health, and will also secure the appointment of a medical officer particularly well qualified to assist the committee in their work.<lb/>
Then, may I call your attention to Part II of the Bill, which deals with town planning. Now the idea of town planning, or of dealing with it by Statute, is, I am sorry to say, a comparatively new one in this country, although there have been provisions of a somewhat similar kind very much used in other countries and with very good effect. Your Lordships will see that Clause 54 says&#x2014;
<quote>"A town planning scheme may be made in accordance with the provisions of this Part of the Act as respects any land which is in course of development or appears likely to be used for building purposes."</quote>
The object of a scheme for town planning is to secure&#x2014;
<quote>"proper sanitary conditions, amenity, and convenience in connection with the laying out and use of the land, and of any neighbouring lands."</quote>
Your Lordships will see that subsection (4) gives the Local Government Board power to approve of a town planning scheme, and without their approval no such scheme will become effective. It is suggested that these are very extensive powers to give to the Local Government Board. Well, my Lords, it, is difficult to say in what other way you could deal with this particular point. I think most people who are concerned with local government are anxious to avoid expense as far as possible, and the insertion of a Provisional Order here would not only add greatly to the expense but also considerably delay the putting into force of any of these schemes.<lb/>
I should like further to call attention to the proviso in Clause 55, by which if the scheme contains provisions suspending any enactment contained in a public general Act the scheme shall not come into force unless a draft has been laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than forty days, so that under this proviso there is a considerable check put upon the Local Government Board, which will not be able to over-ride any public enactment. If your Lordships will turn to Clause 56 you will see that the Local
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0575"/>
<col>1143</col>
Government Board are anxious to secure as far as possible the co-operation of the local authority and the landowners and other persons interested in the land in preparing these schemes. Clause 57 gives the Local Government Board power to enforce a scheme, and I should perhaps remind your Lordships that the idea is not that the Board should do the work unless they are obliged to do it, but that their position should rather be one of supervision and of assistance. Clause 58 deals with compensation, and here your Lordships will see that, under subsection (3), where the property is increased in value by the operation of any town-planning scheme under certain circumstances the local authority may recover from any person whose property is so increased the amount of that increase. Conversely, if the property is injured by one of these town-planning schemes, then by subsection (4) the person will be entitled to recover the amount of the injury which he suffers. Clause 61 deals with compulsion, but I do not think that that is a clause to which any of your Lordships are likely to suggest an Amendment.<lb/>
Now we come to Part I of the Bill, the most important part, dealing with housing. I suppose it is difficult to exaggerate the importance attached by a great many people to this Bill. In the eyes of a great many people housing reform is one of the most important parts of social reform, and, indeed, some think that it lies at the very foundation of that reform. Nobody denies that the problem exists, and this Bill deals with two different departments of the same subject. First of all there is the question of new houses, and there is also the question of insanitary houses and the putting of such houses into proper condition. I think we all admit the difficulty there is in rural districts of building new cottages on an economic basis, and that is why one of the clauses in the Bill provides that the terms on which the loan is to be made to a local authority shall be exceptionally favourable. But the main clause of this Part of the Bill is the first, in which Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes. Act of 1890 is adopted throughout the whole of the country. Up till now Part III of that Act has merely been optional, and a rural district council can only adopt it with the consent of the county council, which has to have regard to various considerations before giving
<col>1144</col>
consent. In point of fact it has been found that that part of the Act has been made very little use of indeed. It has only been adopted by nine or ten rural district councils. Part III of the Act of 1890 becomes operative at once throughout the whole country.<lb/>
The clause to which I am afraid there may be some objection in this House is Clause 2, which must be read together with the First Schedule. It is the clause which deals with the acquisition of land. Now I may say at once that in this matter the Local Government Board has followed the precedent of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act. That is a precedent to which your Lordships have already given your approval, and we hope that you will give your assent to the adoption of a similar procedure in this case. The object which His Majesty's Government have in this matter is really two-fold. In the first place, we want to simplify procedure, and, in the second place, to reduce expenditure; and we believe that this method&#x2014;which I think experience has shown, in connection with the Small Holdings Act, has not worked badly&#x2014;is one which must really be expected to be of considerable value in regard to this Bill. The necessity of simplifying the machinery is proved by a passage in the Report of the Select Committee, in which they say&#x2014;
<quote>"At present one of the chief obstacles in the way of local authorities who desire to put the Housing Acts in operation is the conflicting nature of the machinery by which land can be compulsorily acquired. Not only does this tend to make a local authority reluctant to take any action at all, but in cases where action has been decided upon it almost necessarily increases the expense of their scheme, since local authorities will often be prepared to pay more than the market value of the land required rather than undergo the delay which the resort to compulsory powers now involves."</quote>
This particular clause, when read with the First Schedule, simply follows the provisions of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act.<lb/>
After Clause 3, to which I have already referred&#x2014;a clause which deals with the making of loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the terms on which the loans, are to be obtained&#x2014;there are a number of clauses relating to small matters, such as the expenditure of money for housing purposes in the case of settled land, allowing a local authority to accept a donation of land, and so forth. In Clause 10
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0576"/>
<col>1145</col>
we come to the clause which gives powers for enforcing the Housing Acts, and your Lordships will see that here the Local Government Board step in. In Clause 10 the Local Government Board are empowered, if on due complaint, amongst others from four inhabitants they find that a local authority have failed to exercise their powers, to declare them in default, and to limit the time for carrying out the works required, and in some cases to direct the county council to execute them. Clause 11 provides that if a local authority fail to perform their duty in carrying out an improvement scheme under Part I of the Act of 1890, or in giving effect to an Order as regards an obstructive building, the Board may make an order requiring the local authority to remedy the default and to do what is requisite. Power is, of course, necessarily given to the Board to enforce their Orders by mandamus.<lb/>
Then your Lordships will see that in Clauses 12 and 13 provision is made whereby, under certain circumstances, a county council may step in if, in their opinion, a rural district council have failed to exercise their powers. Clause 14 is a clause which increases the implied condition. Your Lordships know that in the case of houses which are of small value there is an implied condition on the landlord to see that they are kept in a proper state of sanitary repair and are fit for human habitation. This clause increases the number of houses to which that implied condition will in future apply. May I say in passing that this clause does no more than carry out what I might almost call a favourite principle of the Liberal Party. We all know of good landlords who keep their houses in a state of sanitary repair, and one of the objects of this Bill is to impose upon bad landlords the obligation which good landlords cheerfully and readily admit and already undertake.<lb/>
It is just the same principle as that which operated in the case of the Old Age Pensions Act. We know that all over the country there were a large number of good landlords who already gave old age pensions. Now, under the. Old Age Pensions Act, everybody is given an old age pension who is entitled to one, whatever may be the character of his employer. So it is also with the Employers' Liability Acts. A large number of employers throughout the country did, without a doubt, compensate
<col>1146</col>
their workmen probably even more liberally than any employer is bound to do now under the Acts, and the object of the Acts was simply to force the bad employer to do that which the good employer was doing already. Here in this clause we have the obligation put upon the bad land lord to keep his houses in that state of sanitary repair in which a good landlord is always pleased to see his own property maintained.<lb/>
Clause 17 deals with the duty of the local authority as regards the closing of houses which are unfit for human habitation, and here it would, perhaps, be most convenient to deal first of all with the law as it stands at present under the Act of 1890. At the present time it is the duty of the local authority to inspect these houses, but the obligation does not go beyond mere inspection. Then, if it is considered necessary to close these houses, they are closed by the local authority upon an order made by the magistrates. The alteration proposed by this Bill is that the inspection should in future be made in the same way as before, but that the local authority should also keep such records as may be prescribed by the Board. That will mean that probably the inspection will be done more carefully than it has been in the past. The second point is that the local authority will be able to make the order without referring to the justices for the power to close, as they have to do at the present time before they can act. It is obvious, I am sure, that this must result in a great simplification of the system of making closing orders, and that it will render it easier for the local authorities to shut up insanitary houses, while it will also increase the amount of inspection. This very important clause&#x2014;Clause 17&#x2014;which deals with existing insanitary houses also prohibits underground sleeping rooms; and in subsection (8) your Lordships will see that very careful regulations have been drawn up to deal with this particular subject. Clause 18 allows an order for the demolition of a house to be postponed if the owner undertakes to carry out the work necessary to render it fit for human habitation. Then come a number of comparatively unimportant clauses such as those which deal with the vesting of water pipes and the modification of schemes.<lb/>
The next important clause, which is
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0577"/>
<col>1147</col>
likely, I am afraid, to meet with some opposition in your Lordships' House, is one which deals with back-to-back houses. That is Clause 44. Your Lordships will see that this Bill deals with Scotland, but not with Ireland, the latter country having been dealt with last year under a special Bill. It is, however, the intention of the Local Government Board, if your Lordships pass this Bill, to introduce next year a General Consolidation Bill dealing with the whole subject, which will, I think, be a matter of considerable convenience to all who are concerned in the work of local administration. I think your Lordships will agree that if the Local Government Board were to use the powers given them under this Bill too drastically there would be so great a danger of reaction that it would be impossible for the Board to proceed so far as they would wish in this direction. I hope, therefore, your Lordships will think that you may fairly trust the Local Government Board not to go too far, or to use the powers conferred upon them unfairly, but to do their best to make this Bill, if you agree to its passage through this House, a real success. I beg leave to move that the Bill be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02885">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014; (<i>Earl Beauchamp</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02886"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has given us a very clear and concise outline of the provisions of the Bill. I am sure he will expect that I shall be able to offer him an assurance that on this side of the House any measure for improving the housing of the working classes is likely to be most favourably received, because that has always been the policy of the Conservative Party, and the Act which is known as the principal Act is the Act of 1890, which was brought in by my noble friend, Lord Cross, who, I am sorry to say, is not here to-night. Notwithstanding that Act and the Acts which have been passed amending it, there are difficulties still surrounding the question of housing, and these mainly in the rural districts.<lb/>
The noble Earl has stated that the intention of the Bill is to make the bad landlords do what the good landlords always have done. He drew what I thought was not quite a fair analogy, and compared this Bill with the Old Age
<col>1148</col>
Pensions Act. I think he must have forgotten that the Old Age Pensions Act does not make the bad landlords pay pensions to their workmen, but enables the State to give pensions to aged workmen all round. If a similar proposal were contained in this Bill I do not think that great objection would be taken to it, because the charge would be laid on the taxpayer and not, as will be the case, on the ratepayer. The real difficulty is not to get the bad landowner to fulfil his duties but very often, where working class dwellings are insanitary, to find out the actual person to whom they belong. The rents are collected by middlemen and agents, and it is sometimes most difficult to know who are the real owners.<lb/>
The noble Earl said that Part III of the Housing Act has only been adopted in nine or ten rural districts. I dare say that is perfectly true. What is the reason? Is it not that there has been a. fear, amounting, I might say, almost to a certainty, that if that Part of the Act is put into operation it cannot be done economically and a charge on the rates is certain? I venture to think that is one of the main reasons why the Act has not been put into operation to a greater extent than it has been hitherto. I must say that I congratulate the noble Earl on having persuaded the Chancellor of the Exchequer to extend most liberally the period over which loans can be spread. I think that is a very valuable part of the Bill. The period for which a loan is made by the Public Works Loans Commissioners may be extended to eighty years, and this may enable local authorities to make the problem of carrying out a housing scheme economically sound.<lb/>
As regards the town planning part of the Bill, we all, I think, agree that in many cases towns, and the suburbs of towns, are most unsuitably laid out. That is not only a disadvantage and a drawback to those who have to live in the houses, but it often happens that one landowner by laying out his land badly is able very seriously to damage the value of the land belonging to an adjoining owner. Everybody would welcome some scheme by which a common plan could be laid down for the benefit of both. I think the existing evils especially those of overcrowding, of which we see far too much in our great towns, are largely due to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0578"/>
<col>1149</col>
the inelasticity of by-laws. I for one am not prepared to quarrel with the provisions in the Bill that the Local Government Board should have power to set aside under certain circumstances hard and fast by-laws. It sometimes happens that a landowner would be perfectly willing to put a comparatively, small number of houses on an acre of his land, but he cannot afford to do so because the by-laws require him to make a road of enormous width, metalled on both sides, kerbed, channelled, and drained. That is an expense which can only be recovered by covering the land to its utmost capacity with small houses. Therefore I welcome that part of the Bill.<lb/>
I am also glad that there does not seem to be any indication that urban corporations are to be encouraged to go in for land speculation. I was told the other day that the council of the City of Sheffield wanted to raise a loan for the purchase of an estate outside the city, but the Local Government Board refused their sanction. The granting of a loan for the purpose of a housing scheme is quite a different thing from making a plan with which other people will have to comply if they desire to lay out their land. Now, my Lords, I am afraid that the result of this Bill may have the effect of increasing the burden of the already overburdened ratepayer. Under the existing Act, before the county council give consent to the adoption of Part I of the Act, they have to consider the liability which will be incurred by the rates, and the question whether it is, under all the circumstances, prudent for the district council to adopt the provisions of the Act. That is swept away entirely, and, whether it is prudent or imprudent, whether it will involve a charge on the rates or will be conducted on sound economic principles, the Act is to be adopted throughout the length and breadth of the land. I hope I may be wrong, but I have grave misgivings on this subject, because I know that even where housing schemes have been undertaken under the most favourable circumstances&#x2014;and I think they cannot be undertaken more favourably than in London&#x2014;there is still a large burden on the rates. It is said to be a fluctuating burden and one which will in time yield a return to the ratepayer. But I cannot help remembering that something like
<col>1150</col>
&#x00A3;90,000 has been spent out of the rates of London for housing schemes and that about &#x00A3;50,000 or &#x00A3;60,000 is still outstanding. So much for the general provisions of the Bill.<lb/>
There is a peculiarity of the Bill which runs through it from one end to the other to which I feel bound to draw attention. That is the proposal to put in the hands of a Government Department a number of duties which hitherto have always been left either to the local authority or to Parliament. That is a practice which I am afraid under His Majesty's Government has been slowly and steadily growing. It is not a practice which I for one can look upon with satisfaction. May I point out what are the duties which the Local Government Board will have to undertake under this Bill? They are very numerous, but I will deal with them as shortly as I possibly can. Clause 2 takes land compulsorily by order of the Local Government Board. The price is to be decided by an arbitrator appointed and paid by the Board. The local authority concerned are not to be allowed to appear by counsel or to call expert witnesses. By Clause 3 the period for the repayment of a loan is extended. By Clause 5, money paid into Court is to be applied as the Board direct. By Clause 9 it is provided that the Board may institute certain legal proceedings. By Clauses 10 and 11 the Board may declare an authority to be in default. They may order schemes to be carried out and enforce that order by mandamus. I do not know whether the Government have carefully considered what are the precedents where there has been proceeding by mandamus, but I think I am right in saying that they have not, as a rule, been very successful. It is not very easy, I imagine, to put into prison all the members of a county council who refuse to carry out an order of the Local Government Board, and therefore the proceeding is not likely to have much result.<lb/>
By Clause 15 the Local Government Board are to be a court of appeal against the order calling on a landlord to execute works. Clause 19 enables the Board to settle the sum at which certain annuities shall be redeemed, and Clause 23 enables them to dispense with by-laws. Clause 24 enables them to dispense with the confirmation of an Order for a reconstruction
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0579"/>
<col>1151</col>
scheme by Parliament. Clause 29 enables the Local Government Board to appoint an arbitrator to settle what compensation shall be paid for the demolition of what are known as obstructive buildings. Clause 32 provides that the Board may declare expenses to be special expenses chargeable to any contributory place. Clause 38 enables the Board to call for reports from different local authorities. Clause 40 provides that the Local Government Board are to be a court of appeal against Orders even in a dispute in which the Board themselves may be the makers of the Order. Clause 42 states that the Local Government Board may prescribe the form of notices, and may dispense with the publication of those notices.<lb/>
Clause 54 enables the Local Government Board to approve of town planning schemes, including taking land already built upon. They are to decide whether land is likely to be built upon or not, and if a scheme is once approved by the Board it is to be as if enacted in this measure. Under Clause 55 the Board may prescribe general provisions and stop up private rights of way. Clause 56 empowers the Board to make regulations for dealing with matters in the Fifth Schedule, including the hearing of objections by persons affected. Clause 57 authorises the Board to decide whether any person has or has not contravened a scheme. Clause 58 allows the Board to determine whether property has been injuriously affected or whether it has been increased in value and is therefore liable to a betterment charge. Clause 61 enables the Board to compel a local authority to make and to execute a scheme. Under Clause 62 the Board may themselves determine certain matters as arbitrators. Clause 68 empowers the Board to prescribe the duties of the medical officer of health, who is to be appointed by every county council and who is not to be removable save by the consent of the Board.<lb/>
Those are very wide powers indeed to place in the hands of a Government Department. I know that the right hon. gentleman who presides over the Local Government Board is a man of great strength of character. He is a man with great confidence in himself, and I am bound to say he inspires that confidence in other people. I have had the honour of the acquaintance of the right hon. gentleman for a good many years,
<col>1152</col>
first upon the London County Council and afterwards in Parliament, and I have always thought he has been actuated by the highest motives and the greatest desire to discharge the duties of his office with perfect fairness and perfect justness to everybody concerned. But, my Lords, the right hon. gentleman will not always be at the Local Government Board. We hear talk of an impending General Election, and perhaps the right hon. gentleman may find that his attention will have to be more closely confined to Battersea than it has been hitherto, or he might be moved to a higher Department of State, and, if he is caught up, upon whom is the mantle of Elijah to fall? Whatever good opinion I may have of the present President of the Local Government Board, I for one should shrink from entrusting these powers to any and every possible successor of his in that important office.<lb/>
We are told that in this respect we ought to take example by what is done on the Continent. We are told that in Germany, Austria, and Holland the local authorities are all required. to make town planning schemes. Most of you who have travelled on the Continent would be somewhat loath to see a town laid out even like Vienna or Berlin, with their rings and their rectangular streets. I think travellers visiting some of those cities may look back with affection to the times when we threaded the tortuous labyrinths of Threadneedle Street. Whether that be so or not, at any rate we in this country are not accustomed to be, and do not wish to be, governed by a bureaucracy. Our principles are totally different from those which govern foreign nations. We have our local authorities and our supreme Parliament. I am told there are no fewer than 26,000 local authorities in this country, and I am always filled with amazement and satisfaction when I reflect upon the enormous amount of unpaid labour which citizens of this country are willingly giving in order to look after the affairs of their neighbours. I know it is sometimes said of this House that noble Lords might be more regular in their attendance, and indeed I think I have heard the expression "Wild Peers from the Woods." I do not quite know what it means, but I take it that it refers to those Peers who attend our debates comparatively seldom. Why is that? Is it not because those noble Lords are engaged in the administration of affairs in their own localities? I venture to think
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0580"/>
<col>1153</col>
that anything which tends to diminish local patriotism will be a very grievous blow to local institutions generally.<lb/>
There is another liberty which people in this country have long been accustomed to, and which I think they will be reluctant to give up. That is the right of access to Courts of Law. More than once measures have been before Parliament diminishing the right of the citizen to appeal to the Courts of Law. We find that again in this Bill, and I sincerely hope that before the measure leaves your Lordships' House that blot, as I consider it, upon the Bill may be removed. We are told by the noble Earl that we should follow the precedent set by the Small Holdings Act in the matter of the acquisition of land, and the noble Earl has said, or, if he has not said it, at any rate it has been said elsewhere, that no injustice has been perpetrated under the provisions of that Act enabling a local authority to take land for the purposes of small holdings from those who are at present in occupation of it. I venture to say that is a mistaken opinion, and that there have been cases of very great injustice. There is a case in Norfolk known as the Ringer case. I will not go into the details of it, but I merely say this: The man whose land was taken thought he had the right that everybody ought to have of appealing to a Court of Law. He went to a Court and asked that Court to say that the taking of this land from him compulsorily was unfair and inequitable. But the answer the Court gave to him was that a scheme so made was as if it were enacted in the Act; that ousted entirely the jurisdiction of the Court and the man had no remedy at law whatever. I venture to think that is an unfortunate state of affairs, and I think each man ought to have a right of appeal to the Courts of Law of the country. I suppose the noble Earl will not be surprised to hear that a large number of Amendments are likely to be put down to this measure, and they will, I think, probably deal with some of the points with which I have ventured to trouble your Lordships.<lb/>
We have received this Bill at a very late period of the session. If we had had it a little earlier it might have been possible carefully to consider the whole question and to have tried to arrive at some tribunal which would have been supreme over the decisions of the Local Government Board in
<col>1154</col>
respect of parts of this Bill. But the time is. I think, too short for that. I should have liked to have seen something similar to what His Majesty's Government have already suggested in another place and in another Bill. I refer to the Finance Bill, where I understand provision is made that a Court of Referees shall be appointed to decide certain questions in dispute. In the present case I think there would have been an advantage in adopting that course, because a Court of Referees, such as is suggested, would have laid down certain principles upon which they acted, and those principles would gradually have grown into the accepted case law of the country. But in the absence of that we have to consider, I think, in what way we can amend the Bill in accordance with existing precedent. With reference first of all to taking land compulsorily, as provided by Clause 2, I am willing to admit that the procedure under the Lands Clauses Act, where you want to take a comparatively small area of land, or land of comparatively small value, is cumbrous and expensive. It is not, perhaps, the best machinery for the purpose, and I think I have had occasion to say that more than once in this House. Now the question is, Is there any alternative between the Lands Clauses Act and the arbitration of the Local Government Board? Your Lordships had a Bill before you last session which came up from another place, and I think I am correct in saying that the original proposals in that Bill for taking land compulsorily were the same as that proposed in the Bill now before your Lordships' House. It was the Port of London Bill. But before the Bill reached your Lordships' House that procedure had been altered, and in lieu of small holdings procedure it was proposed that a single and independent arbitrator should be appointed who should decide the compensation which ought to be paid. The most important part in the clause in that Bill, however, was that if, in the opinion of the arbitrator, the matter was one involving so large a sum of money or was of such great importance that it ought not to be removed from the ken of Parliament, then he was to recommend that it should go through the ordinary course of a Provisional Order. If some such procedure were adopted in the present case it would be an improvement in the measure as regards the taking of land.<lb/>
When you get to town planning schemes I venture to think you are there dealing
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0581"/>
<col>1155</col>
with what may be a matter of very great value indeed. I do not imagine for a moment that there will be very many of these town planning schemes in a year, and I cannot see why for that purpose we should not adhere to the existing practice of taking land by Provisional Order. The noble Earl objected to Provisional Orders because he said they took a very long time to get through and were also very expensive. Is that really the case? After all Parliament sits every year, and it could not take more than twelve months to get a scheme through Parliament by means of a Provisional Order. But what of the cost? I have looked into the cost of Provisional Orders and I see, though I cannot refer to any very recent dates, that a Committee on Private Business of the other House reported that the average cost to a local authority of an unopposed Provisional Order was only &#x00A3;80. I think your Lordships will admit that that is not much for a large town to pay. Even supposing that a Provisional Order is opposed the cost is not excessive, and I should like to give your Lordships a few statistics to show that the number of Orders opposed is an infinitesimal proportion of the whole. In the six years from 1892 to 1898 the average annual cost of opposed Provisional Orders was only &#x00A3;233. I repeat that that is not a very large sum for a wealthy community to pay. I find that in 1907 there were 106 Provisional Orders introduced into Parliament, of which four were opposed in your Lordships' House and 102 passed through the House unopposed. In the House of Commons seven of those Orders were opposed, and ninety-nine were unopposed. Then I come to the following year, 1908, and I find that the total number of Provisional Orders introduced was ninety; of these six were opposed in this House, and eighty-four were unopposed. In the House of Commons only one of those Provisional Orders was opposed and eighty-nine were unopposed. I give these figures because I think there has been a general opinion outside Parliament that the Provisional Order was a very costly, difficult, and lengthy method of procedure. I do not think that really is the case. I believe not merely that it is less expensive than most people think, but as a matter of procedure I gravely doubt whether your Lordships would be right in removing entirely from Parliament these great town planning schemes, which may be made to affect in a material degree the near future of our great towns all over the country.<lb/>
<col>1156</col>
There may be some other Amendments to be proposed with which I need not trouble your Lordships now. I will only say, in reference to them, that I hope the Government will pardon us if on this side of the House we do put down a good many Amendments. I think we are, as your Lordships will admit, justified in doing so. The noble Earl who is conducting the Bill has stated that it passed through the other House with great rapidity. I think he said that fifty-two clauses were dealt with in a day. He also observed that although it passed through the House this year with great rapidity it was very carefully considered in the previous year by one of the Grand Committees. That may be perfectly true, but I would remind your Lordships that we have no access in any shape or form to the proceedings in Grand Committee on Bills which are under discussion by the House of Commons. Those proceedings are not reported, and all we know of the views entertained by these expert gentlemen&#x2014;I am not for a moment calling into question their capacity to deal with the subject&#x2014;is gained from the bare record of the way they have voted on Amendments which are submitted to them. Then I would point out that there are clauses which we been introduced this year and which have, owing to the operation of the guillotine, not even been mentioned during the discussion in the House of Commons. There is one which I do not know whether His Majesty's Government have really considered at all, or reflected as to its full meaning.<lb/>
Let me give your Lordships an illustration of how these things may be allowed to slip through. I am informed by those who are competent to pronounce on the wording of the clause to which I refer that the effect of it would be that your Lordships would never be able to have a manservant to sleep in the basement of your house. I cannot believe that to be the intention of His Majesty's Government, but undoubtedly it was passed through the House of Commons without a single word being said upon it. I was glad, at any rate, to learn from the report of the speeches of the right hon. gentleman the President of the Local Government Board, that he, at any rate, has some use for your Lordships' House, because in his hurry to get the Bill through the final stages in another place he made certain promises that when the Bill got
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0582"/>
<col>1157</col>
up here he would propose some Amendments to meet objections which were taken there. That is a valuable admission that in your Lordships' House some of the errors allowed to slip through in another place may be corrected even by His Majesty's Government. I welcome this measure as a complementary measure to the Acts which stand upon the Statute Book, and which have had their inception and their initiation on this side of the House. I object to the tendency to remove matters from the control of Parliament. I think there are many details in which the Bill is ill-considered and ill-digested, but I think it offers an excellent opportunity for your Lordships' House to exercise its powers of revision, which are the most important of this Chamber, and I hope that the result of the Bill may be a solution of the difficult problem on which depends the health and comfort of the urban and rural working classes of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02887"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will ask you to listen to me for a few moments on this Bill, but what I have to say is entirely with reference to what concerns our great cities, and not to what concerns the rural districts. I suppose there could be no assembly in which there are so many people qualified to speak on the details of rural affairs, so many people versed in the management of rural affairs, but I suppose there are not quite so many who have an intimate knowledge of the concerns of our great and still rapidly growing cities. We are all of us proud of our own city, and certainly I am very proud of the city in which I live. It is one of the very many which have grown up out of a number of villages in which factories were established, which grew together and have grown and become a vast city, altogether without what one might call any guiding mind or plan or scheme.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has just sat down confessed that he became very easily wearied with the monotony and regularity of a city laid out like Vienna, and that a little experience of a German-planned city made him long for the tortuosity with which we are familiar in London. I venture to think that if any one of your Lordships were to set about the task of learning your way about Birmingham you would indeed feel that tortuosity and complication and absence of plan had been allowed to run to
<col>1158</col>
excess. I do not think it would be possible for any one to make a survey of many of our great cities, even of that in which I live, without feeling that the condition of things was in the highest degree disastrous to social and public welfare. You may pass vast areas in which there is no open space&#x2014;for your Lordships must know that London stands, in respect to open spaces, as compared to a great many of our provincial towns, in a position of quite infinite superiority&#x2014;and this is due, no doubt, to the fact that the city grew up totally without planning. There can be no one acquainted at all with the sanitary condition of the poorer parts of our cities who does not know that reform on a very large scale, and of a very drastic character, is necessary. I venture to say also that no one can be acquainted with the condition in which the suburbs are still being allowed to grow, and the extraordinary rapidity with which the new suburbs of our cities degenerate into slums, without knowing that a very careful, and, indeed, a deep-rooted and far-reaching plan and method of town planning is quite essential.<lb/>
This Bill is designed, I presume, to meet those two particular evils; it is designed to meet the evils inherent in our slum dwellings, the small houses in the poorer parts of our cities, and also to limit, as far as can be limited, the evils due to the total absence of plans with which our cities are still being allowed to grow up. I was heartily glad to hear the noble Earl who has just sat down say what he did as to giving a general welcome to this Bill, though I do not exactly feel sure how much of amendment he intends to propose. At any rate, for my own part I heartily welcome the Bill as being on the whole a thoroughly beneficial measure entirely in the right direction. The noble Earl said what indeed is true, that it has not been our manner to encourage centralised government and bureaucracy. Is it not the case that any one acquainted with our English life must realise that there is a very large opportunity for us to limit the go-as you-please policy which Englishmen delight in without by any means speedily or easily arriving at the point of completely centralised bureaucracy? I do not think it would be possible for any one who knows the history of the efforts made in the last thirty years to remove the appalling evils with regard to housing, who knows the difficulties which those efforts have met
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0583"/>
<col>1159</col>
with or has realised how often those efforts have been unsuccessful, to fail to see that we do need a great deal more of what we call central control.<lb/>
I was glad to hear the noble Earl who introduced the Bill speak of the clause about the appointment of medical officers of health. What the noble Earl said upon this subject touches a point which must be familiar to any one acquainted with local politics&#x2014;namely, the extreme need of giving a far greater measure of independence to the medical officer of health. I heartily welcome that particular clause. But there is one other clause with regard to which I should like to say a word. Those who in my neighbourhood are specially interested in this matter are profoundly impressed by the fact that we must rely to a great extent, not only on municipal efforts, but also on the efforts of public-spirited individuals and voluntary societies for the promotion of public utility. Therefore they are very urgent about Clause 61, subsection (<i>b</i>), which, I believe, was threatened in the House of Commons and survived with difficulty, and which would give the Local Government Board the power of interference. The clause provides that if the Local Government Board are satisfied on any representation, after holding a local inquiry, that a local authority have failed to adopt a scheme proposed by owners of any land in a case where the scheme ought to be adopted, the Board may order the local authority to prepare and submit for the approval of the Board such a town planning scheme and to adopt the scheme, or to consent to the modifications or conditions so imposed. The persons to whom I refer earnestly hope that His Majesty's Government will adhere to that clause, which gives the Local Government Board power to intervene where it appears that local public bodies have not been sufficiently willing to assist and co-operate with public-spirited individuals.<lb/>
My Lords, there is one clause which was in the Bill but which is not in the Bill as it now appears, the absence of which some of us deeply deplore. I would earnestly ask this House whether it is not possible to restore, even at this stage, Clause 30. Clause 30, as it was, instituted a quinquennial survey and register. It made it the duty of every local authority to cause to be made in every parish an
<col>1160</col>
inspection survey as regards certain property; and the things which had to be registered included the addresses of the rated occupier and the beneficial owner. Those of us who have been interested in this matter for some time have cause to attach extraordinary importance to such a register. In part there is already an obligation upon the local authority to make a survey of the property within their region, but inquiries made by the National Housing Reform Council led to the recognition that this duty was being very widely neglected. It appears there were only sixteen, I think, out of 112 urban and rural district councils which effectively carried out the requirements of the law. Now I observe that in Clause 11 as it stands in the Bill there is power given to the Local Government Board to intervene to cause the local authority to be more efficient in the fulfilment of what is already their statutory obligation, but that falls very far short of the proposal in Clause 30 as it did stand in the Bill. An important deputation&#x2014;introduced, I believe, by the most rev. Primate&#x2014;laid great stress upon the importance of this survey and register, and I think I am right in saying that the late Prime Minister specially recognised the importance of that point. I should very much like to know from His Majesty's Government why it was that that clause was dropped out of the Bill. In part it may be on the plea of expense. It is not for me to estimate what the expense would be; but I venture to say that even considerable expense would be thoroughly justified in order that, we might have this register and know who owns, with the different degrees of ownership, the worst kinds of property to be encountered. in parts of our cities.<lb/>
It was once my lot in London to have something to do with a society for the buying up of slum property in order to get it into better hands, and my experience of the extraordinary difficulty of ascertaining the name of the owner rooted in my mind the necessity of all information with regard to occupation ownership being accessible. I very much wonder whether the influences, which I have reason to believe are very strong influences, leading to a desire to conceal the ownership of the worst properties, have not had something to do with the resistance to what was Clause 30. There is no consideration which Parliament ought to entertain
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0584"/>
<col>1161</col>
which makes it in any way desirable or excusable that the real ownership of the worst properties should be a matter difficult to ascertain, and I very seriously ask His Majesty's Government whether they will afford facilities for the restoration of Clause 30. I thank your Lordships for having listened to me, although I know there are very large parts of this Bill with regard to which I have no experience or knowledge to justify me in speaking; but I am quite sure that no one could be acquainted with the actual conditions of our cities without becoming alive to the fact that trenchant and wide reforms are necessarily and primarily required for the welfare of the poorer parts of the population&#x2014;reforms so trenchant and far-reaching that, human nature being what it is and the interests involved being what they are, no one can hope that they can be carried through without having to encounter resistance and overcome opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02888"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no intention, in the few remarks I desire to make, of taking objection either to the principle of the Bill or to the policy which has induced the Government to bring this measure forward. I agree with what my noble friend the Chairman of Committees said, that we on this side of the House are quite as much in favour of the policy of housing the working classes as noble Lords opposite, and we see in any success this Bill may have a very valuable amendment of the law. But, as has been pointed out by Lord Beauchamp, this Bill has not received full discussion in the other House, and the reason I wish particularly to allude to one or two points is that Amendments which it was intended to be moved on behalf of the County Councils Association, and which would have been supported by Members conversant with local government on both sides of the House, had no opportunity of being brought forward, and there was no discussion in the other House on the points involved. Although the points which I speak of were not dealt with, yet I recognise that the position of the county councils under this Bill is considerably improved as compared with what it was in the Bill as originally brought forward. They are now more or less recognised as the main sanitary authority in a county, to whom there should be an appeal in cases where the minor authority neglects its duty before that
<col>1162</col>
appeal goes to the Local Government Board. In many cases the county councils are conversant with the circumstances of a particular district, and they may be able to arrange the matter satisfactorily in a case of default without its going to the Local Government Board.<lb/>
The points to which our Amendments refer are points which have been dealt with rather fully by the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees. We take special exception to some of the claims that are made for the Local Government Board to certain powers, many of which I believe are at all events quite unusual, and some quite unprecedented. Beyond that we feel that there are parts of the Bill which, if passed into law, would seriously affect the position of the local authorities, would be a distinct blow at local government, and would form a very dangerous precedent. In Clause 40 the Local Government Board are made the final court of appeal in all matters. With regard to matters of fact, and with regard to whether or not an authority has made default, we must recognise the Board as the final court of appeal; but I join my noble friend Lord Onslow in urging that the Local Government Board ought not to be made the final court of appeal in cases of law, and especially not in cases of law where they are parties themselves to the question that arises. Where there is a difference between the Board and a local authority as to the interpretation of the law or whether the view the Local Government Board takes is strictly within the Act of Parliament, it seems clear to me that the only satisfactory decision can be by a Court of Law.<lb/>
Let me take another case. In Clause 10 power is given to the Local Government Board to make an order on the county council directing the county council to do the work themselves in cases where the minor authority makes default. This is not work which has been given to the county councils by Statute, and it does not seem to be within the discretion of the President of the Local Government Board, who has to administer the law, to decide that the county councils shall undertake work which they are not compelled by Statute to do. It may be desirable in certain cases that the county councils should undertake this work with their own consent, but if they are not willing it seems to me outside the powers of the President
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0585"/>
<col>1163</col>
of the Local Government Board to require them to do so. Those are instances of the powers claimed for the Local Government Board in this Bill. But there is a much more serious claim which has already been alluded to&#x2014;namely, the question whether in any of these schemes an Act of Parliament can be over-ridden. I am aware that at the last moment a clause was inserted in the other House which provided that in cases where an Act of Parliament was altered the scheme should lie upon the Table of the House for forty days; but I would put it to your Lordships whether the matter has been fully and deliberately considered by Parliament, and whether even in that case an Act of Parliament ought to be set aside by the scheme being laid upon the Table of the House. Although in many cases attention would no doubt be called to it, and probably there would be some security, there might be a number of small matters in which small people might be injured who would not have the power to get attention called to it in Parliament. The matter is, at all events, a very serious one. This is the first time, I think, that the head of a Department would be given power to over-ride an Act of Parliament. Although I am grateful for the Amendment inserted in the other House, it should certainly be considered whether it is sufficient, or whether the provision ought not to be struck out of the Bill altogether.<lb/>
My noble friend the Lord Steward, in referring to the latter part of the Bill which is almost non-controversial, made a short reference to one particular point on which the County Councils Association feel very strongly indeed. The county councils are perfectly willing to take up the share of the work which falls to them under this Bill. They have not the least desire in any way to appear as interfering with the Local Government Board. They wish to cooperate with the Board with regard to that work; to assist, as far as they can, as the principal sanitary authority of the county, with the principal medical officer of health; and to do everything in their power to expedite the satisfactory operation of this Bill. They take no exception to the important provision&#x2014;I do not think the clause was referred to&#x2014;that every county council shall appoint a medical officer of health. County councils who at present possess medical officers recognise the great advantage of having a skilled officer of the highest class at the head of the county,
<col>1164</col>
not only in making reports to the council, but in using his influence in public health matters with the minor medical authorities.<lb/>
But while entirely approving of that, we take the strongest possible exception to subsection (2) of Clause 68, which gives power to the Local Government Board to prescribe the duties of the medical officer of health. The county council appoint the officer; they have to pay him, and if it is necessary to say what are the duties to be carried out under this Act they ought to be laid down in the Act, and the county councils would direct their medical officers to carry out the duties so prescribed. But the Local Government Board have no right to interfere and prescribe the duties of a medical officer of health for a county. If this is done it is certain to lead to friction and misunderstanding, and as the medical officer of health, under subsection (5) of Clause 68, "shall be removable by the county council with the consent of the Local Government Board and not otherwise," of course, he will look upon the Local Government Board as his master and not the county council. I sincerely hope that the Local Government Board will see the desirability of leaving out both of these subsections. I know the noble Earl, in introducing this measure, referred to the fact that it is very necessary to guard, so to speak, the medical officer of health, for fear he should be interfered with by those who might be interested themselves in the housing schemes. Let me remind him that the county council have not the power of initiative under this Bill at all. I quite recognise that in the case of a small rural and urban district council carrying out sanitary work of this sort it may be necessary to protect their medical officer, but the county medical officer is in a totally different position. I hope I shall be able to show, when the Amendment is moved, that such a subsection is not necessary.<lb/>
I have referred to these matters because they are of vital importance as far as the position of the county councils is concerned. We look upon them as matters which would really interfere with the due carrying out of their duties by the county council themselves. I have no wish to use threats with regard to any action which I, or those whom I represent, wish to take on this Bill, but I must say that if the principal part of our Amendments is not accepted, we would far rather see the Bill lost, however
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0586"/>
<col>1165</col>
serious that might be, than that there should be provisions contained in it which we believe would be a serious blow at local government, and would form a dangerous precedent. All I can say, in conclusion, is that we have not the least wish to see that done. I hope the Bill will be passed, but I do appeal to the right hon. gentleman the President of the Local Government Board and to the Government that they will consider the points which I have brought forward, and that they will try and meet us in a reasonable manner, for I believe if our Amendments are carried they will not do harm to the efficiency of the Bill itself but will really contribute to its smooth working.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02889"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join in the general welcome which has been given to the Bill to-night by every Member of the House who has spoken, and not least by those noble Lords who, with exceptional knowledge and authority, have criticised weightily and in a manner to awaken the interest of all of us some of the detailed provisions which the Bill contains. It is simply impossible for any of us who, like many who sit on the Episcopal Benches, have worked for years in the darker parts of our great cities, to regard without profound thankfulness the substantial part of the enactments embodied in this comprehensive Bill. It contains undoubtedly many details which are open to controversial treatment and in which it is possible that modifications may be desirable, but those who have drafted each part of this Bill and carried it through the other House seem to me to have an aim with which we ought all to be ready to sympathise, and with which I think every one who has spoken to-night does sympathise.<lb/>
As to the first part of the Bill, relating to the housing of the working classes, it is, I suppose, the desire of every one that the main purpose of what is there set forth shall be given effect to&#x2014;namely, that the houses in which the poorer members of our community are forced to dwell shall not only be, as the law requires, fit for human habitation when they are first entered upon, but that they shall, by some means or other, be kept so under proper authority from the beginning to the end. For example, Clause 44, to which some exception is likely to be taken, refers to back-to-back houses. I should be surprised if any one having
<col>1166</col>
personal knowledge of the difficulties consequent upon the erection of such houses would be prepared to stand up in this House and defend a system of construction which runs counter to every principle of wholesome comfort and even of decency, as well as of sanitation. Many of us have taken a prominent part in this House in advocating temperance reform and licensing reform, but I say unhesitatingly that if the purpose which this Bill sets itself to achieve can be wisely given effect to, it is more valuable than anything that we have endeavoured to aim at and accomplish by any Bill that I have had cognisance of with regard to either temperance or licensing reform. This question of the people's homes lies behind and below those particular endeavours, and we should effect very much by means of a Bill of this kind which we have endeavoured to effect in other ways.<lb/>
Legislation of this sort cannot have its value fully gauged at the moment it is before the House. Thirty years hence people will be able to say that what we are doing now was a wise course of action to pursue. There has been some allusion to-night by the Bishop of Birmingham and by others to the section which has disappeared from this Bill, the section which was known in the House of Commons as Clause 30. There are many details with regard to that clause, as to the processes and cost of inspection, and so forth, on which I am not prepared to challenge the decision of those who have decided to withdraw the clause. What I do desire to learn is whether, if that clause is not to be persevered with, there is any connection between its abandonment and the cry which has been sometimes raised that if that clause were persevered in we should be gibbeting or making public in some offensive manner the names of the owners of the worst class of property. My Lords, to make those names public is exactly what we want to do. I maintain that a man is doing a distinct wrong to the community who endeavours to conceal his identity and his name, and yet is earning money out of property of which he is ashamed to acknowledge the ownership. I cannot conceive that that reason, at all events, ought to have influence upon the question of the retention or otherwise of such a clause as this, and I should be surprised to learn that that is the ground upon which the clause in its old form was withdrawn.<lb/>
The second portion of the Bill, that which
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0587"/>
<col>1167</col>
relates to town planning, is one, of course, in which the problems are less controversial than are the matters I have already referred to; but there, again, those of us who are acquainted with what in the large suburbs round our towns is the present condition of matters, the way in which houses are being pushed forward, the manner of the construction of the houses and the planning of the streets, know very well that in a few years the haphazard system now allowed will result in our having, not old slums, but new slums. Some control is absolutely necessary as to the manner in which land is to be covered with houses so as not to cause future difficulty. The noble Earl the Chairman of Committees spoke as to his interest in our old streets. It is a very interesting thing to thread our way through the old streets of an ancient town, but to say that for that reason it is desirable we should repeat what we see in the old towns as regards narrowness and darkness, picturesque as these may be, and should run up houses in a way people are running them up now, seems to be a burlesque or distortion of the principles which ought to guide us. Nobody suggests, I imagine&#x2014;certainly this Bill does not&#x2014;that it is practicable for us in most of the great English towns to emulate the streets of a great Canadian city, making them sixty yards broad, with lines of trees and stretches of turf, and so forth. Those are possible where land is obtainable for the asking and the area covered is not likely to be crowded as our areas are. No one suggests, again, that we should place ourselves under a system of bureaucratic control such as is prevalent in Germany, but there is a wide difference between such results as that and what we are asking for when we say that there should be some control over the way in which our streets are being hurried and huddled forward in the suburbs of our great towns to-day. I believe it is true that modern experiments have shown it to be perfectly possible to make the plannings of new streets both profitable and convenient, and I hope that the main clauses of that kind in this Bill will be given effect to without hesitation or doubt.<lb/>
There is one other point which I wish to refer to. It is in Part III of the Bill. I refer to the question as to the medical officer of health in our boroughs being a man who gives his whole time to the work, and who is not removable by the local
<col>1168</col>
folk whose actions he is often compelled to criticise. Most of us have heard of cases where a man has, in moments of outspoken honesty, said that he would long ago have protested against some of the conditions or facts which came under his notice as medical officer or sanitary inspector but for the uncertain conditions of his tenure of office. In this way the Bill is effecting a great change; and, taking it as a whole, I venture to believe it is a Bill which will, when it stands upon the Statute Book, be found to effect a genuine and beneficent change likely to be fruitful in years to come.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02890"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having given some attention to some of the matters contained in this Bill, perhaps I may be allowed to endorse what has fallen from so many of your Lordships regarding the general idea and scope of the Bill as it deals with insanitary dwellings, and at the same time to express the hope that His Majesty's Government will see their way to accept many Amendments which appear to be desirable and absolutely necessary. Otherwise I think that this Bill will fall by its own weight. It is an extremely complicated Bill, and while seeking to remedy one evil we may, unless great care is taken, introduce others which do not appear at the moment on the surface.<lb/>
Various points have been raised this evening which seem to require revision. I should like to draw attention to two more. There is a very drastic regulation in Clause 17 as to the duty of a local authority in closing a dwelling-house which is unfit for human habitation. This would specially deal with dwellings in what are known as basements in towns. I suppose there are a great many basement rooms where people sleep which are no doubt very unsatisfactory and ought to be rigidly dealt with. At the same time, if carried out too drastically I think it will prove to be a task almost of impossibility. It would practically mean the remodelling of an enormous portion of London and of other big towns. That is one thing which I am sure will be dealt with in a practical spirit by Amendments when the time comes. There is another point in the town planning part of the Bill. I allude to Clause 58, subsection (3), which is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Where, by the operation of any town planning scheme, any property is increased in value the responsible authority, if they make a claim for the purpose within the time (if any) limited by the scheme (not being less than three months after the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0588"/>
<col>1169</col>
date when notice of the approval of the scheme is first published in the manner prescribed by regulations made by the Local Government Board), shall be entitled to recover from any person whose property is so increased in value the amount of that increase."</quote>
By that clause the Local Government Board may, if they think right, claim the whole amount of what they say is the increased value of the particular property caused by a town planning scheme having been carried out.<lb/>
Now, we have heard a great deal of discussion out of doors and in the other House about Increment Duties, but this appears to me, if I read the clause aright, to go very much further than anything that has been proposed as to an Increment Duty, because here the local authority do not merely tax the owner of the property upon the increased value, but they actually take the whole of it themselves&#x2014;that is to say, they may say what is the increased value and may claim an amount of money equivalent to what they say is that increased value. In many cases this would, I am sure, be unworkable. Take the case of certain property worth, in round figures, &#x00A3;1,000. A town planning scheme is put in operation, and the local authority say it has increased that particular property by &#x00A3;500, and it is now worth &#x00A3;1,500. They can then claim from the owner of that property the odd &#x00A3;500, and that can be recovered as a debt. The question arises, How is this amount to be raised? In all probability, if it is a town property, it will be already heavily mortgaged in order to provide for the buildings erected upon it. If the owner is obliged to have recourse to a sale to raise the money it would be in the nature of an enforced sale, and perhaps not even the original value would be realised. Then comes a great difficulty which I have no doubt has not escaped your Lordships' notice and will probably be dealt with when the proper time arrives&#x2014;namely, whether this will militate against any increment duty, or how you will get over the difficulty of paying on the increased value which, if it ever existed, has been actually taken away. These are some of the many points which require to be dealt with. Some of them are minor matters although of some importance. The proper housing of the people is one of the most important things we have to deal with, and I sincerely hope that this Bill, when properly amended, will prove a useful addition to the Statute Book and get rid of some of the
<col>1170</col>
worst complaints we have to deal with in the body politic. Therefore, I should not be one of those who would resist the general principles of the Bill, so long as these difficulties which I have mentioned are properly and effectively dealt with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02891"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>:
My Lords, I agree that this is one of the most important Bills which has been brought to the notice of the House, but I am not quite so sanguine as some of those who have spoken to-night, particularly the most rev. Primate, as to the results of legislation of this kind. As far as my experience goes, it is far more because the legislation which is now at our disposal has not been properly used than that the powers do not exist which has made us behindhand in these matters. I am rather tired, after a certain length of experience, of seeing Bill after Bill of this kind, giving more and more power to local authorities, passed into law, for we make very little progress owing to the fact that there is no means of putting the powers which legislation places at our disposal into actual operation. I confess that what I like best, perhaps, about this Bill is that in some directions it does give power to enforce the carrying out of the Act in a way which has never been possible before. I do not, therefore, object to the increased power of superior authorities over the smaller district authorities.<lb/>
But the strange part of this Bill, just as it was the strange part of the Small Holdings Act, is the extraordinary jealousy of county councils which the present Government always show. After all, the idea of county councils was, I always supposed, a Liberal idea. In the early days of my Parliamentary experience it was always my Radical opponents who were asking me whether I would go in for county councils, and although at last the County Councils Act was passed by a Conservative Government one would have thought that it was a proposal which would have met with the cordial acceptance of noble Lords opposite. Instead of that, when they come into office they curtail and fetter the powers of county councils as far as they possibly can. They are always talking about representative government, devolution, and so forth, and yet in other directions, whether it be education, small holdings, or the housing question, they are, as I say, limiting the powers of county councils and treating them as if they had not hitherto done their duty
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0589"/>
<col>1171</col>
properly and were not likely to do it in the future. Broadly speaking, if half the powers which are given in this Bill to the Local Government Board were given instead to the county councils, I believe the Bill would be a very much better one.<lb/>
I wish to ask His Majesty's Government &#x2014;and this is the real reason why I venture to address your Lordships now&#x2014;to tell us, either now or in the course of the Committee stage, what are their grounds for distrusting the county councils. In this particular Bill there is a very strange instance of distrust, and that is in regard to the appointment of the medical officer of health. Both the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, and the most rev. Primate spoke as if the medical officer was interfered with and fettered in the discharge of his duties by members of the county council. I think it was Lord Beauchamp who said that members of the county council were often interested in the very houses and property which the medical officer of health had to report upon, and therefore he did not get fair play. With rural and urban districts that may be perfectly true, but this is a clause which regulates the county councils, and the medical officers under county councils, and. I want to know what authority there is for saying that any county council has interfered with their medical officer. My own experience is that the county councils have for the most part, with some very few exceptions, been so anxious to promote the sanitary condition of their counties that, although they were not compelled by Statute, they have appointed medical officers, and I have heard over and over again laments on the part of the members of county councils that their powers under the Statute are so small to enforce sanitary improvements in their county. And I know that in most instances they have gone to the fullest extent of their powers in trying to remedy the sanitary conditions of the areas under their authority. The truth is, a county council is far too large a body&#x2014;large in this sense, that it is chosen from too large an area&#x2014;to have the sort of feeling which Lord Beauchamp seems to think it may have to the medical officer. It is true that you may have that feeling in a small district, and I think you should increase the powers of the county councils over small districts; but I do protest most strongly against such accusations being
<col>1172</col>
made against the county councils of England in introducing a Bill of this kind. I think that if they are made they should be proved to the hilt.<lb/>
I do not know that I need detain your Lordships further to-night. There will, of course, be a great deal in the Committee stage which we shall have to say about this Bill. But I desire, before I sit down, to mention one other subject. The most rev. Primate hoped that the clause with regard to inspection had not been withdrawn because it would "gibbet" landlords who did not do their duty. I must confess that I was surprised that any one should think so. Those who are of that opinion might be referred to the report of the speech of the President of the Local Government Board in another place when he withdrew that clause. He entered very fully, in an admirable speech, into the reasons for withdrawing the clause. It was withdrawn, not in the interests of the landlords, but of the people whose interests it was supposed to serve. The right hon. gentleman has had considerable practical knowledge of the matter, and he considered it would not serve the interests of those people. I might also suggest that it was a most cumbrous and expensive provision and would have produced the maximum of labour and the maximum of cost with the least possible result. But whether that be so or not, I repudiate at once the idea that there was any thought of shielding bad landlords. I am sure no one in this House would wish to shield bad landlords, and I do not think that the most rev. Primate should entertain the possibility of the idea.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02892"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think His Majesty's Government must be well satisfied with the reception this Bill has met with here. At any rate, it is perfectly clear that in no quarter of the House is there any kind of hostility to the Bill as a whole. There is every desire to co-operate with the Government in dealing with the housing problem, which the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, justly described as perhaps the most important part of social and sanitary reform. But I do not think the Government can be surprised that the Bill has been subjected to a great deal of criticism. I do not suppose there ever was a Bill more important in itself, and containing a larger number of technical and difficult details, which passed through the House of Commons with so little
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0590"/>
<col>1173</col>
examination there. We have heard from the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees that practically there was no discussion of this Bill in public in another place, and therefore I was very glad to hear from the noble Earl opposite that ample opportunity would be given for the consideration of this measure in Committee here, and really I think he admitted that it rests with your Lordships' House to place the Bill into that shape in which it might properly become law.<lb/>
I do not desire to detain your Lordships with any real discussion of the greater part of this Bill, but with regard to the town planning schemes I quite believe, with those who have already addressed your Lordships, that the time has come when it is very desirable that local authorities should have something to say in the laying out of new towns. I believe that that kind of interference with the free will which has hitherto guided the operations of owners of property in the neighbourhood of towns will be of great public benefit, and, if properly regulated, will do more good than harm to the owners of property themselves. I will not enter into the details of the alterations of existing Acts with which so large a part of this Bill is occupied, though I must say I agree with what fell from the noble Lord, Lord Zouche, that we ought not to legislate too minutely in matters of detail. Take, for example, that remarkable clause which I do not believe was subjected to any examination whatever in the House of Commons&#x2014;Clause 17. That clause provides that &#x2014;
<quote>"A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be a dwelling house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either&#x2014;"</quote>
and then it is laid down in the most minute detail that if such rooms do not come up to a great many requirements in the clause they shall be deemed unfit for human habitation. I believe there are thousands of houses to which this subsection as it now stands would apply and in which these basement rooms, although now occupied as sleeping rooms, would be illegally occupied. I know of a house in which I had the good fortune to reside myself for a good many years in Downing Street which would not comply with all the conditions laid down in this clause.
<col>1174</col>
If noble Lords opposite would be good enough, when they next call upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to look down at the area upon each side of the front door of that house, they would see that it is nothing like four feet wide, and that it has nothing like the area clear of the premises which is required by this clause. I think that all you can do in such a matter as this is to lay down general provisions and trust to the authority to carry out those provisions carefully and judiciously. I hope such proposals will be carefully examined when we go into Committee.<lb/>
I am anxious to say a few words with regard to the very important provisions in this Bill which relate to rural areas. I do not profess to have any special acquaintance with those large cities of which the right rev. Prelate spoke with such force and knowledge, but I do know something of rural areas, and I confess that, although I am extremely anxious to promote better housing accommodation for the poor, I do not look with any sanguine expectations on the proposals of this Bill. No doubt you may find in very many parishes throughout England insufficient cottage accommodation, and such cottages as exist are in not a few cases not such as you would desire human beings to live in. But it is very difficult indeed to deal with this problem, and I fear that it is not adequately dealt with in this Bill. The great difficulty, of course, is the expense. What has prevented rural districts throughout England from adopting the provisions of Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes Act up to this date? The noble Earl said they had been adopted only in nine such cases. Does not that show that they feel they cannot adequately carry out those provisions? You may make Part III of this Act compulsory in all rural areas of this kind. No doubt that will be done; but when you have taken the rural councils to the water they will not voluntarily drink. That I am absolutely certain of. Rural councils are not constituted for carrying out building schemes of this kind. They are probably not very efficient bodies for the purpose, and have, I think, one great feeling beyond all others in their minds, and that is not to allow an indefinite increase of the rates.<lb/>
The noble Earl pointed to the provisions of Clause 3, under which these authorities are enabled to borrow money at the cheapest possible rate from the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0591"/>
<col>1175</col>
Public Works Loan Commissioners. I should very much like to know why His Majesty's Government have not extended those favourable terms to other persons. Other persons beside local authorities are permitted to borrow for these purposes and are encouraged to do so by the existing Acts&#x2014;such as railway companies, dock and harbour companies, companies formed for the promotion of labourers' dwellings, employers employing a considerable number of workmen, and even private owners of land, provided their interest is not less than the leasehold interest of fifty years. Why are such persons not to be allowed the same advantages in borrowing money from the Public Works Loan Commissioners as are to be given to these rural district councils? If these problems are to be solved, they are much more likely to be solved by individual effort, on philanthropic grounds to a certain extent, than by rural district councils. Wherever you find good cottages now in the rural districts of England they have been erected almost invariably by the landowners, I do not say by any means on philanthropic grounds alone, but with a desire that the dwellings for the labourers on their estates may be such as human beings can live in. Although it seems to be fashionable to suppose that nothing can be done by individual effort and that the State is likely to do more efficiently work formerly done by the individual, I believe that by individual effort can this matter best be solved, and I am certain that individual effort will be discouraged if rural district councils are forced by the Local Government Board to increase the rates by building operations.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I come to the power of the Local Government Board to compel by mandamus the district councils to put into force the provisions of Part III of the Act. As the law now stands, those provisions can only be put in force in a rural district area where the county council, after a local inquiry, was satisfied that the Act should be put in force, having regard to the necessity for the accommodation for the housing of the working classes in the area and what probability there is of such accommodation not being otherwise provided, and having regard also to the liability which would be incurred by the rates and to the question whether it is, in the circumstances, prudent for the local authority to undertake the provision
<col>1176</col>
of such accommodation. Those words have not been inserted in the Bill as it stands. I want to know, if the Board are to make an order compelling a rural district council to put those provisions in force, whether they ought not to be satisfied on the points on which the county council have to be satisfied under the existing law before allowing the adoption of Part III of the Act of 1890. Then, my Lords, the Local Government Board in England are to be the paramount authority in this matter. Their order is to be final after local inquiry. I entirely agree with what has fallen from several speakers, that there ought to be an appeal to the Courts of Law from the Local Government Board upon all questions of law, though perhaps not of fact.<lb/>
Why is it that in this Bill His Majesty's Government have treated England differently from Scotland? If noble Lords will look at Clauses 10 and 11 they will see that in England the Local Government Board are supreme in matters referring to Part I of the Housing of the Working Classes Act and Part II or Part III of the principal Act. Their order settles everything. If you will turn, however, to the latter part of this Bill, to page 22, you will find provisions for the application of the Act to Scotland. There we find that Clauses 10 and 11, applicable to England, are not to be applied to Scotland. As regards Scotland all that the Local Government Board can do, if they consider a local authority to be in default, is&#x2014;
<quote>"to apply by summary petition to either Division of the Court of Session or during vacation or recess to the Lord Ordinary on the Bills, which Division or Lord Ordinary are hereby authorised and directed to do therein and to dispose of the expenses of the proceedings as to the said Division or Lord Ordinary shall appear to be just."</quote>
As far as I can see, in Scotland that leaves the whole authority in this matter to the Courts of Law. I should not ask for that in England, but I do ask His Majesty's Government why, having proposed these provisions for Scotland, everything in England is to be decided by the Local Government Board, and they are not to be subject to the jurisdiction of any Court at all?<lb/>
With regard to the compulsory acquisition of land for the purposes of the Act, the noble Earl said that the provisions of the Small Holdings Act had been adopted. Well, that is not quite correct. No doubt the procedure is the same as under the Small Holdings Act, but
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0592"/>
<col>1177</col>
there is a very important difference. In Clause 45 your Lordships will find that&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in the Housing Acts shall authorise the acquisition for the purposes of those Acts of any land which is the site of an ancient monument or other object of arch&#x00E6;ological interest."</quote>
And there is another Clause prohibiting altogether the acquisition of common lands, which, in these days, appear to be considered much more sacred than private lands. Why is that clause of the Small Holdings Act not incorporated which provides that no land acquired by railway and other companies or which forms any part of parks, gardens or pleasure grounds should be taken compulsorily under the Act? In rural districts land of that character cannot possibly be wanted for the erection of cottages, and it ought to be excluded from this Bill. I would express the hope that before we enter upon Committee these matters which I have ventured to allude to may be considered by His Majesty's Government, and that they will, at any rate, endeavour to meet the views which have been expressed by many speakers on this side of the House with regard to Amendments in this Bill. I am confident that if those views are met on fair and reasonable terms, we shall be able, before concluding our dealings with this Bill, to settle the provisions of a measure which may be of great benefit to the country in many respects, and which may do something to promote&#x2014;though, not, I fear, as much as I should like to see&#x2014;the erection of proper labourers' cottages in rural districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02893"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount who has just sat down believes that His Majesty's Government ought to be satisfied with the reception which this Bill has met with. I can say freely that the reception is quite as good a one as I expected, and perhaps in some respects better. It is true that some parts of the Bill have been subjected to somewhat close criticism, and it is foreshadowed that Amendments, not only numerous but drastic, are likely to be moved. But on the whole I think that the spirit in which we have brought this matter forward has been appreciated by your Lordships' House, and I hope that as the discussion proceeds we shall be able to defend some of those particular provisions
<col>1178</col>
to which exception has this afternoon been taken.<lb/>
It has been said that this measure has not received a full meed of discussion in another place. Of course, in one sense that is true so far as the whole House is concerned and so far as this session is concerned. It is not, I think, our affair to discuss the methods in which in another place business is conducted. I frankly admit that we here are sufferers from the fact that the proceedings in the Standing Committees are not fully reported. On the other hand, I am told by those who take part in those discussions that the great, and, I believe, the universally admitted, merit of those Committees arises mainly from the fact that the proceedings are not reported, and that therefore no regular speeches are made. I believe that to be the fact, and those who agree with noble Lords opposite have come round to the belief that some of the most valuable work which is done in another place is done in the Committees upstairs. But I admit that it would be more agreeable to us if we had an opportunity of following more closely the discussions which have taken place there.<lb/>
The noble Viscount who has just sat down alluded not very hopefully to the general adoption of Part III of the Act of 1890, and pointed out that in his view not a very great deal was to be hoped for from rural district councils in this matter. My Lords, we hope that the easier terms on which money is to be lent will have a real effect in encouraging the provision of houses. The noble Viscount asked why it was that if the easier terms were to be given to local authorities they could not be given to building companies, which were of a semi-philanthropic kind, and even to private individuals. Speaking only for myself, I should be glad if that could be done; but I think it was the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees who expressed his astonishment at the fact that the Treasury had been induced to agree even to this degree of extension of loans. I confess I should not go very hopefully to them to ask that loans of public money should be extended to these building companies, from whom in the very near future, in the matter of houses, much may be hoped, but to whom, having regard to the nature of the security,
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0593"/>
<col>1179</col>
it might not be so easy to extend the provisions of this Act.<lb/>
Much has been said upon the provisions of this Bill for the compulsory purchase of land without having recourse to Parliament, and the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees developed his objections to them at some length. It has already been pointed out that there is a precedent in the case of the Small Holdings Act of last year. There is an earlier precedent in the Local Government Act, 1894, in regard to the acquisition of land by parish councils. I think we must look at this matter from the general point of view of how you are going to make the machine work. I think it cannot be disputed that any other method of acquiring land must be more expensive and also more tedious than that which we propose. The noble Earl the Chairman of Committees frankly admitted that in the case particularly of small parcels of land procedure by Provisional Order under the Lands Clauses Act was both costly and cumbersome, and he suggested that some such course might be adopted as that which was taken with regard to the Port of London Bill. Now in the case of the Port of London Bill, the Local Government Board were empowered, if the local authority applied, to authorise the purchase, but they would have to appoint some impartial person unconnected with themselves to hold an inquiry before the purchase could take effect. If that person was of opinion that, owing either to the situation of the land or its value, Parliamentary sanction ought to be required, then it would become a case for a Provisional Order; and in any case the purchase could not take effect until the draft had been laid for thirty days on the Table of both Houses. That provision was, I think, very fairly inserted in the case of the Port of London. In that case it was very likely that the authority would seek to acquire and belonging to those who were, or might be, their rivals in business&#x2014;people in distinct competition with them. I do not see how any case of that kind could occur in this instance, and I think before suggesting a course which is certainly slower, and also would lead to considerably more expense, the noble Earl ought to establish some closer analogy between the circumstances which affect the Port of London and those which affect local authorities who may seek to buy land for these purposes.<lb/>

It has been said throughout the debate that excessive powers are given all through to the Local Government Board. The noble Earl the Chairman of Committees read out a long list of the powers given. The powers no doubt are considerable, but you have to consider, as I said before, whether you can make your machine work, and it is important to bear in mind that you may produce a scheme on paper extremely complete in all its parts, safeguarding everybody, full of appeals, and altogether admirably correct in all its details, but so correct that nothing will be done under it. And therefore, when your Lordships are preparing or desiring to amend the Bill by multiplying appeals, by making provisions for this, that, or the other to lie on the Table of your Lordships' House or to come before Parliament, you must bear in mind that if you do that too freely you may produce a Bill which will look very well but will suffer the fate of a great many former Acts which have had to do with the acquisition of land for public purposes&#x2014;namely, that no one will proceed under it. I hope, therefore, that in putting Amendments forward your Lordships will bear this consideration in mind.<lb/>
After all, this is not a question of the Local Government Board on one side, of what powers they ought to have or what their position ought to be, and of the county councils on the other. Both the Local Government Board and the county councils simply represent a means to an end to do business for the benefit of the inhabitants of this country. Neither of them are institutions which date from Mount Sinai. They have to serve a public purpose, and it is not a question of <i>amour propre</i> on the one hand, or, as I venture to think, of purely abstract considerations of centralised powers on the other, so much as of what in a measure like this will make it really valuable and useful for the purposes for which it is designed. Now, as regards town planning, the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees hoped that we should not fall into the manner of creating towns such as exist in some countries on the Continent of Europe. I think there is no risk of a Vienna arising in these islands. I am almost inclined to wish that there were such a risk, for Vienna has always seemed to me a most beautiful city. Neither do I believe that there is the smallest risk in this country &#x2014;the fear was expressed by the Lord

Bishop of Birmingham&#x2014;of our falling under the domination of a hard bureaucracy. On the contrary, the difficulty is, in my opinion, to get those who are interested in local business to be, if I may say so, bureaucratic enough, and not to depend too much upon the mere chances and inspiration of the moment.<lb/>
My Lords, there are special considerations, which I was glad to see were recognised by the noble Duke opposite, the Duke of Northumberland, in relation to the minor authorities which certainly make some degree of supervision most desirable. It is a matter of common knowledge to us that on district councils, both rural and urban, it is a very frequent thing for those interested in speculative building and in land speculation to obtain seats, and if a census were taken I think it might surprise us to find what a very large number of members of those local bodies are interested in the one trade or the other. Nobody blames those gentleman for going on to these bodies to look after their own interests, but the consequence does undoubtedly follow that the proceedings of those bodies demand close supervision, and that supervision, as I hope and believe, they will receive in some cases from the county councils, and in other cases from the Local Government Board under this Bill.<lb/>
I need say very little about this question of town planning because it has received, I think, general acceptance from your Lordships. But it is important to remember that there are a great number of owners of building land, not very well off, who are compelled to realise their land as they can, and are only able as matters now stand to realise it through the agency of the jerry builder. That, we hope, will cease to a very great extent by the operation of the town planning clauses of this Bill. Where land is split up into a diversity of ownerships, the development has generally proceeded on the wrong lines, and it would be impossible that it should be otherwise except by some such provisions as we now propose. Here, again, it is said that the Local Government Board have been given too much power, and it has been said that they ought not to be judges in their own case. But there are no cases under this Bill to which the Local Government Board can be said in any strict sense to be party. They do not promote any schemes of their own,
<col>1182</col>
they pass other people's schemes. Therefore it is surely not strictly accurate to describe them as being in any sense parties where decisions have to be made. They are only so far interested&#x2014;if that is the word to use&#x2014;that they can modify schemes which are put before them. They are not promoters, and it is somewhat an abuse of language to speak of them as being in any sense parties to the case.<lb/>
It is said that the powers of county councils are being limited by this Bill. That, again, seems to me to be not a strictly accurate way of describing what is proposed. It is true, no doubt, that provision is made for dealing with default in certain cases. Even those who have the greatest admiration for county councils&#x2014;and I claim to have as much admiration for them as anybody&#x2014;must be prepared to admit, however, that they are not all equally meritorious in these social matters. So long as county councils, or, indeed, minor bodies mentioned in this Bill, do their duty generally in regard to these housing questions they will not be interfered with in any way by the Local Government Board. It does not seem to me to suggest any slight to the great majority of those bodies to insert a provision in a Bill to the effect that, assuming they fail in particular instances, they should be subject to the control of the central authority. I think it is carrying sensitiveness on such matters rather too tar to object to such control, unless it is intended to be seriously argued that the control is likely to be misused.<lb/>
My right hon. friend the President of the Local Government Board has received in the course of this debate many compliments to which I have listened with great pleasure. It was suggested by the noble Earl opposite (the Earl of Onslow) that the right hon. gentleman might not be in perpetuity in his present office. My Lords, I say without hesitation that whoever may be there and to whatever Party he may belong, whether he be selected from among noble Lords opposite or anywhere else, I should not fear any misuse by the holder of that office of the powers conferred upon his Department under this Bill. It is sometimes said of other Departments that you ought not to confer wide powers upon them because matters of acute controversy affecting the opinions and beliefs of various people which have, unhappily, become the subjects
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0595"/>
<col>1183</col>
of party dispute, may have to be settled by administrative action. But, my Lords, in cases of this kind nothing of the sort can arise. All the proceedings under this Act will be of the most cold-blooded character. There is nothing about them to excite prejudice, resentment, or party feeling. The question whether or not a particular 100 acres of land ought to be laid out as a town is not one that stirs the blood of anybody, except, perhaps, that of the fortunate gentleman who thinks he may have a chance of selling those acres. It is a question on which the Local Government Board could be trusted to give an absolutely cool and impartial opinion. This, then, is another matter which I would ask noble Lords to bear in mind in framing their Amendments. When you speak of conferring powers on a central department it is not only important to consider on one side the magnitude of those powers, but also the character of the subject on which they are to be applied.<lb/>
The only other point, I think, which was raised, and with which I have not dealt, was that with regard to the medical officer of health of the county council being in some degree subject to the Local Government Board. I fully admit that there is a very marked difference, well known to all of us who are familiar with county conditions, between the position of the medical officer of health of a county council and that of the medical officer of the smaller bodies. His position, no doubt, is generally safeguarded by the considerations mentioned, among others, by the noble Duke opposite. The representations of the noble Lord who speaks for the county councils will, I am sure on that point, be very carefully considered by my right hon. friend, although, of course, I am not able to say how far my right hon. friend will be able to meet the noble Lord. I quite agree that this measure ought to have, and I have no doubt will have, very full consideration on the Committee stage, and we shall make a point, so far as we can, of seeing that ample time is provided for that purpose. I have myself the highest hopes on the result of this measure, although, as was said very truly by the most rev. Primate, its results will be seen by another generation far more clearly than they can be by us. I believe this measure is the starting point of a new order of things, but that new order can only come gradually and slowly into operation. I am also in agreement with the most rev. Primate
<col>1184</col>
when he said that he believed that, taking it all in all, this is the most important social question existing.<lb/>
For I have always felt that, whether it might be in the town, or whether it might be in the country, it is impossible to suppose that all the pains you might take to make your education system perfect could ever be genuinely successful if the children to be taught were living in homes which were little better than pigsties, perhaps worse than cellars. Equally, I have felt, with regard to the drink problem, that whatever you might do by means of Licensing Acts or in other ways it was impossible to cope to the full extent with the evil of excessive drinking as long as people live in intolerable homes. For that reason I am very glad indeed to know that we are trying to do what we can to encounter this great national evil, which has not diminished as one would have hoped to see it do, with the advance of wealth and all the refinements of civilisation which we enjoy in these latter days. All the benefits of cheap transit and of the other social advantages which the poorer classes now enjoy have not enabled them as a class to be very much better housed. It has been said, and said truly, by more than one speaker that there was nothing more depressing or disheartening in this country than the sight of the brand new slums which rise up in the suburbs of our great towns. Anything more depressing than some of the great suburbs to the eastward of London I think can hardly meet the eye of man. I hope, therefore, that the effects of this Bill will not merely be positive and mandatory, but that they will also be very largely educative in the way of bringing home a sense of some of our national deficiences to local authorities and to individuals.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0002P0I0596"/>
<col>1185</col>
the Second Reading debate yesterday. His point was this&#x2014;Why under Clause VI of this Bill were Civil servants whose offices were abolished entitled to receive no more than those who were leaving on the ground of ill-health? At first sight, my Lords, this does seem unfair to the former class, but really it is not an unfair proposal, as I shall try to show. It has been in the main the practice of the Treasury for over twenty years not to give what are called abolition terms to Civil servants and no great hardship, I understand, has arisen therefrom.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be allowed for one or two minutes to go into the history of the matter, because this clause has really rather a lengthy history. I understand that in 1888 a Royal Commission, presided over by the late Lord Ridley, inquired into this matter. They found that these abolition terms had given rise to very great abuses and had been too often used to get rid of inefficient men. I think in the following year there was a debate in the House of Commons on this point, and a Resolution was proposed protesting against the useless burdens which were placed upon the country by these abolition terms. An Amendment was moved by the Government of the day, and the Government were defeated on this point, possibly as a result of that debate. Mr. Goschen&#x2014;as he was then&#x2014;in August, 1889, said that for some time past these abolition terms had not been allowed; and Mr. W. H. Smith said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is our deliberate intention to legislate on this question at the earliest possible period next year."</quote>
Then there was a question put by my noble friend, Lord Wolverhampton, on March 17, 1892. He asked whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce a measure relating to the superannuation of Civil servants in accordance with the Report of the Royal Commissions on Civil Establishments. Mr. Goschen, in reply, said that in view of possible delay before a new Superannuation Bill could become law, the Government had taken steps whereby effect had already been given to the main recommendations of the Royal Commission on the subject of Civil superannuation. He went on to say that abolition of office no longer entitled the retiring officer to a special rate of pension.<lb/>
I believe it was formerly the practice of
<col>1186</col>
Departments to reorganise and retrench on a very much larger scale than has been the case latterly, and no doubt abolition terms were much more useful in those days than they have since become. Now-a-days it is very rarely that reductions of this kind are made in Departments, and when a reduction takes place if a man is an efficient Civil servant a place is found for him in some other Department. In the case of an inefficient man there is no hardship if the reduction takes place on the same terms as in the case of a person who is retired on the ground of ill-health. This clause really legalises what has been the practice of the Treasury, with certain exceptions, for over twenty years. I have made search, but I have not been able to find what was the view of Lord St. Aldwyn when he was at the Treasury. I have no doubt, however, that his view was the same as that of his former colleague whom I have just mentioned. I may state that this clause has behind it the weight of a high authority at the Treasury, the value of whose opinion the noble Marquess would clearly recognise, and as the provisions of the Bill have been considered immensely satisfactory by the Civil Service I hope the noble Marquess will not think it necessary to press for any alterations to be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02897"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very much obliged for the explanation which the noble Lord opposite has just favoured me with. I have no doubt whatever that these abolition allowances did lend themselves to abuses, and that there were reorganisations and reconstructions which were very bad bargains for the public. Therefore I am not surprised to learn the practice of granting these special allowances has been discontinued. But I own that I still feel some doubt as to whether it is wise to deprive the Government by Statute of the power of giving special allowances when a desirable reconstruction takes place and certain offices are thereby abolished. It seems to me that unless you have the power of occasionally giving these allowances you may find it impossible to carry out a very desirable reconstruction without doing a great injustice to individuals concerned, but I will not press the matter further.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02906"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> moved the insertion of a new clause after Clause 35. The object of the Amendment was, he explained, to allow certain unregistered trade unions which had been established for more than twenty years to be given similar exemption to that which the registered trade unions were given by the Bill. The reason for doing this was that certain very old-established trade unions, particularly in the textile trades, had not been registered under the Trade Union Act. As their Lordships knew, there was no reason why a trade union should be registered unless the members wished it. There was no obligation upon them to register, and he understood that the reason these trade unions had not registered was that many of the workers in these trades were very young and did not comply with the age limit of the Trade Union Act.</p>

reminded their Lordships that he had called attention in Committee to the proposals of this clause, and had suggested to His Majesty's Government that they hardly knew enough with regard to the action of these industrial insurance companies and collecting societies to justify legislation and that really an inquiry before legislation would be better. He hoped that might still be considered, but he did not wish to press it now. He also felt that as great abuses had taken place in the past, the law being practically neglected, and as the Government proposed to narrow the right of insurance in the future there ought to be some security that the law would be observed in the future. He therefore asked at the previous stage of the Bill whether there was any penalty on companies and collecting societies for breaches in the law in this respect, and the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, he thought under a mistake, assured him that there was. He now found that there was none and therefore he proposed to insert in the clause a new subsection to bring a breach of the law in this respect under the penalties of the Bill. Together with that he thought they might fairly extend the insurable interest proposed in subsection (1) from "money to be paid for the funeral expenses of a parent" to "money to be paid for the funeral expenses of a parent, grandparent, or grandchild."</p>

With regard to this subsection, which allowed the conversion by order of the Court of a collecting society having more than 100,000 members into a company, which might no doubt in certain circumstances be very desirable, he thought that some provision was required for enabling the members of the society to be heard in a manner which the subsection did not now provide. He had heard of a case of a collecting society in Lancashire removing its offices from Manchester to London and then holding its meeting in London, which few of the members could attend, and taking steps to the advantage of certain of the office holders and others which might not have been sanctioned by all the members of the society. That was what they wanted to avoid as far as possible. Therefore he hoped the noble Lord in charge of the Bill was prepared with some Amendment to insure that applications of this kind to

<title>THE POOR LAW COMMISSION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02956"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member> rose to call attention to the Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws. The most rev. Primate said: My Lords, I ought, I think, to apologise to the House for the long time during which my notice to call attention to the Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws has stood upon the Paper and the repeated postponements which have occurred with regard to its coming forward, but these have not been due to any carelessness on my part but to the peculiar circumstances of a somewhat abnormal session and to what I was led to understand would be the general convenience of the House. I am glad to bring the delay to an end now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02957">It may quite reasonably be asked why it is that no Motion is proposed by me, and that I merely desire to call attention to the subject. Frankly the reason is this, that, if I may judge from such information as reaches me, the House is hardly ready for such a Motion just yet. Somehow or other people have been deterred from making up their minds upon this matter&#x2014;partly, perhaps, by the supposed difficulty of the subject, partly by the mass of material which has to be mastered, and partly, possibly, by the knowledge that, massive as the material already is which has been placed before Parliament and the country, we have not yet had nearly all of it. The very sight of the volumes in their less merciful form&#x2014;for there is here a merciful condensed reprint&#x2014;is enough to daunt the stoutest heart. There are sixteen volumes already circulated, the
<col>1196</col>
first of which has 1,258 folio pages, and there are thirty-five volumes to follow, making fifty-one in all. Happily, those that are to follow are not of the same proportion as the volume, in every sense weighty, which has taken the lead.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02958">My object this afternoon is to call attention to the importance of this subject as a whole, to the nature of the juncture in English history at which we stand, and to the practical possibility of dealing with the question speedily or at once. If nothing is soon done or promised I shall be perfectly prepared at the proper moment to move that definite action be taken&#x2014;action which, I am confident, would have far-reaching consequences for good. I am certain that there is grave danger in letting a matter like this alone until people are able perhaps to say that the information now so carefully collected is out of date, and that new conditions have arisen. Therefore, my Lords, real mischief may arise from any prolonged delay in our dealing with the question which has been thus imperatively brought to our attention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02959">May I first call your Lordships' attention to the occasion and the circumstances in which these mighty volumes see the light? It has happened in modern English history that at successive great occasions in the national life people have felt it to be necessary that there should be periodical reconsideration of our responsibility for, and our duty towards, the weakest and the poorest, some say the most troublesome, part of our community. That has happened at a number of successive junctures in modern times. Stock has been taken as to what were the then facts about the weakest and poorest of our people, and as to what needed doing for the common good. I will give examples of what I mean.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02960">Nearly 400 years ago, when, the changes which came about at the Reformation&#x2014; using that word in its largest sense&#x2014;brought a resetting in our national life, including the dissolution of the monasteries, which had meant so much for good or evil to the poorest part of our population, the country was overrun with poverty-stricken folk, some of them sick and helpless, but a vast number of them merely thriftless and idle. There is a very marked difference between the way in which those cases were approached then and the way in which we try at all events to approach them
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0602"/>
<col>1197</col>
now. There was then an abundant inculcation of charity, and no doubt it was acted upon to a certain degree, but the main idea which underlay legislation on the subject at that time was rather how to get rid of the burden of inconvenient or troublesome people than how to ameliorate their lot or to accept responsibility for their care.<lb/>
Accordingly a great number of Statutes, which some of us would now consider rather as blundering efforts in a confused sea of difficulties than as a coherent and consecutive endeavour to follow a definite policy, succeeded one another rapidly. At least thirteen such far-reaching and drastic statutes, some of which try to take the whole subject in hand afresh, were placed on the Statute Book in the sixteenth century within the space of little more than fifty years. Let me give an example. In the first year of Edward VI a Statute was passed which begins by recalling the wildly-fierce enactments of the previous reign and then recites as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"That partly by foolish pity and mercy of them which should have seen the said godly laws executed and partly from the perverse nature and long-accustomed idleness of the persons given to loitering, the said godly Statutes have had small effect, and idle and vagabond persons have been Suffered to remain and increase, and yet so do";</quote>
and, as a milder punishment, enacts that&#x2014;
<quote>"An able-bodied poor person who does not apply himself to some honest labour, or offer to serve even for meat and drink, if nothing more is to be obtained, shall be taken for a vagabond, branded on the shoulder with the letter V, and adjudged a slave for two years to any person who shall demand him, to be fed on bread and water and refuse meat, and caused to work by beating, chaining, or otherwise. If he run away within that period, he is to be branded on the cheek with the letter S, and adjudged a slave for life; if he run away again, he is to suffer death as a felon. If no man demand such loiterer, he is to be sent to the place where he says he was born, there to be kept in chains or otherwise, at the highways or common work, or from man to man, as the slave of the corporation or inhabitants of the city, town, or village in which he was born, and the said city, town, or village shall see the said slave set to work, and not live idly, upon pain, for every three working days that the slave live idly by their default, that a city forfeit &#x00A3;5, a borough 40s., and a town or village 20s., half to the King and half to the informer."</quote>
That, my Lords, was the mode of treating the able-bodied pauper, as we should describe him now, in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02961">For those who were in genuine need, from real sickness or old age, the giving
<col>1198</col>
of help was not only offered to them, but enforced somewhat decisively upon the donors. In a Statute of the fifth year of Queen Elizabeth's reign it is enacted that&#x2014;
<quote>"If any person of his froward wilful mind shall obstinately refuse to give weekly to the relief of the poor according to his ability, the Bishop shall bind him to appear at the next sessions; and at the said sessions the justices there shall charitably and gently persuade and move the said obstinate person to extend his charity towards the relief of the poor of the parish where he dwelleth; and if he will not be persuaded, it shall be lawful for the justices, with the churchwardens, or one of them, to tax such obstinate person, according to their good discretion, what sum the said obstinate person shall pay weekly towards the relief of the poor within the parish wherein he shall dwell; and if he refuse, the justices shall, on complaint of the churchwardens, commit the said obstinate person to gaol, until he shall pay the sum so taxed, with the arrears."</quote>
That was the mode of dealing with the non-able-bodied pauper, enforcing his care upon those who ought to see to it. So much for that period. Rigour gradually became less, and through the reign of Elizabeth, to begin with, we see a growing sense of what the nation owed to itself. A sense of common humanity and collective responsibility was the immediate and the efficient cause of the institution of the Poor Laws as we know them now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02962">I turn from that to quite a different period&#x2014;to the age of the French Revolution. The whole subject was considered afresh at that time, and not, as we should now say, considered and dealt with very wisely or usefully; but it is interesting to find Pitt and Fox and Burke all speaking upon the subject and practically uniting in the legislation which was the outcome of their prolonged debates. Acts were passed in the last decade of the eighteenth century which laid down, strangely as it seems to us, that the farmers must, whether they liked it or not, find work, or, at all events, wages, for those who were unemployed, and that the several parishes must see to their own sick folk. Some of your Lordships may remember the memorable speech of William Pitt in 1795, a speech which formed the basis on which the legislation of the following year was laid down.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02963">Then forty years later came the great Reform Bill and the new start which followed from it. It was a Parliament bent, as its members thought, on mending what they regarded as being amiss, and so in 1832 a Royal Commission was appointed to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0603"/>
<col>1199</col>
deal with the whole subject, and in 1834 its memorable Report was presented. That Report was commended to the House by Lord Brougham, then Lord Chancellor, in a speech of what I must call almost savage eccentricity, as unlike as possible to the eloquence which delights the House as it comes from the Woolsack to-day. It was a speech of portentous length, of extraordinary strength and originality, but of quite amazing dogmatism. If any of your Lordships will read that speech and note the way in which the House and the country were dragooned as to what they ought to do and how they ought to do it, the contrast to which I have ventured to refer will be apparent. In the debates that followed a very prominent part was taken by the Bishops of London and Exeter, the former of whom had been Chairman of the Royal Commission, and in 1834 the law was enacted under which in a great measure our system of poor relief has been administered to this day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02964">At each juncture, at each change in our national life, this subject has come afresh to the front, and now, more than seventy years after the Reform Bill legislation, we have again to face the old problem under new conditions, and to deal with what are, on the whole, I think, reasonable demands on behalf of the poor; and we ask legitimately how far what was done seventy years ago holds good to-day or corresponds with contemporary needs and facts. It is possible that some thoughtful person, say, in 1837, when Queen Victoria came to the Throne, may have anticipated the kind of advance since seen in industrial and social legislation, in extension of comfort in living, in sanitary science, in expansion of national wealth, and in general education, and if anybody did so foresee what changes were going to come about we can hardly doubt that he would, as a necessary corollary to that, have looked for a huge decrease in pauperism or in the need for the old-fashioned Poor Laws. The Commissioners of 1834 themselves said that their Report was mainly negative, and that to moral and religious education rather than to anything else they looked for amelioration in the existing conditions. In their summing up they say&#x2014;
<quote>"The measures which we have suggested are intended to produce rather negative than positive effects; rather to remove the debasing influences to which a large portion of the labouring population
<col>1200</col>
is now subject, than to afford new means of prosperity and virtue. We are perfectly aware that for the general diffusion of right principles and habits we are to look, not so much to any economic arrangements and regulations as to the influence of a moral and religious education."</quote>
To such an observer and thinker, were he still alive&#x2014;and it is not impossible, for Lord Wemyss is still a member of this House, and he was then twenty years old, and there has been no more keen observer than he&#x2014;to such an observer what would be the impression which present-day facts convey as to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of the expectations then held out? Has there been a real decrease in pauperism, or in the need for legislative aid? Let me trouble your Lordships with a very few figures. Before 1871 the Poor Law statistics were compiled in a way that renders comparison with the facts of to-day almost impossible, but, taking the figures at that date and since then, the following would seem to be the facts. In the cycle of ten years to which 1871 belongs, the number of paupers, or persons relieved was, roughly, about 748,000 annually. In 1908 the corresponding number, again speaking roughly, was 772,000&#x2014;an increase of 24,000. Of course, population has meanwhile increased by leaps and bounds, and when we compare the persons relieved with the population we find that, roughly, in 1871 there were thirty-one paupers per 1,000 of population, and in 1908 twenty-two per 1,000. That has the appearance of a change for the better, but our satisfaction is damped when it is remembered that in the first place to the twenty-two must be added a great number of people who are now relieved by public funds but not through the Poor Law. I refer to those who are helped by Industrial Schools, by rate-supported Infectious Hospitals, by the provisions of the Unemployed Workmen Act, the Law authorising rate-aid for child feeding, and in a great number of other ways. The whole subject of the treatment of lunatics has to be remembered in that connection, a large subject too complex for statistics. Then, too, voluntary charitable activity has increased tenfold during these seventy years, and ragged schools, waifs' and strays' associations, the Salvation Army, the Church Army, and countless other agencies all minister now to the relief of those who would in old days have had to rely upon the Poor Law. Adding all the people so relieved to the twenty-two
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0604"/>
<col>1201</col>
per 1,000, the figures give little cause for satisfaction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02965">The Commissioners, in their Report this year, say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is very unpleasant to record that, notwithstanding our assumed moral and material progress, and notwithstanding the enormous annual expenditure, amounting to nearly sixty millions a year, upon poor relief, education, and public health, we still have a vast army of persons quartered upon us unable to support themselves, and an army which in numbers has recently shown signs of increase rather than decrease. To what is the retrogression due? It cannot be attributed to lack of expenditure. Is this costly and elaborate machinery we have established defective, and if so where does it fail to accomplish its end? Is the material upon which this machinery operates becoming less amenable to the remedies applied?"</quote>
More than that, some of the legislation which has been carried through in quite recent years with the distinct object of ameliorating the lot and relieving the difficulties of the neediest has been somewhat two-edged in its effect. I quote again from the Commissioners' Report&#x2014;
<quote>"It may be noted that the increase in male pauperism occurred chiefly during the cycle commencing in 1896. This period coincides approximately with the passing of two important measures of social reform. The Local Government Act of 1894 changed the character of the Poor Law authorities by the abolition of the property qualification for membership of boards of guardians and of the <i>ex officio</i> members whose influence had previously been considerable. And in 1896 the first of the series of Workmen's Compensation Acts was passed which, we are told by a large number of witnesses, has made it more and more difficult for a man to obtain work when thrown out in the later years of his working period of life. No statistics could be obtained to show to what extent these measures have contributed to the increase in the number of paupers."</quote>
Those are sentences which I am quite sure that it is well for us to take to heart when we are dealing with the subject on a large scale. All this is perplexing, depressing, and some of it may seem a little ominous; and it is well, therefore, to remember, that if we pass from statistics and endeavour to draw for ourselves a general popular picture as regards such undefined and non-tabulatable things as the prevalence of misery and neglect, or the reasonableness of our present-day modes of action, or the thoughtfulness of our modern methods of administration, beyond all question there is marked improvement all along the line.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02966">I alluded a few moments ago to what seem to us now the strange, clumsy, ineffective, and even harmful enactments
<col>1202</col>
of the eighteenth century, making farmers and owners find work or wages for every loafer, and when one thinks of what must have been the demoralising effect of those provisions one wonders at the statesmanship, high and exalted as it was, that gave birth to such legislation. The Commissioners in their Report in 1834, after describing the doles with which wages were eked out, said&#x2014;
<quote>"But it is more usual to give a rather larger weekly sum, and to force the applicants to give up a certain portion of their time by confining them in a gravel pit or in some other enclosure, or directing them to sit in a certain spot and do nothing, or obliging them to attend a roll-call several times in the day, or by any contrivance which shall prevent their leisure from becoming a means either of profit or of amusement."</quote>
That is a picture of a system still prevailing in the lifetime of many members of this House, and it is a curious revelation of what seems to us now at all events to have been the somewhat reckless or unreasonable manner in which legislation had tried to deal with the difficulties prevalent a hundred years ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02967">Then, again, there was the "rounds-man" system as it was called, which the Commissioners in 1834 described thus&#x2014;
<quote>"The parish contracts with some individual to have some work performed for him by the paupers at a given price, the parish paying the paupers. In many places the roundsman system is effected by means of an auction. Mr. Richardson states that in Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, the old and infirm are sold at the monthly meeting to the best bidder, at prices varying according to the time of the year from 1s. 6d. a week to 3s.; that at Yardley, Hastings, all the unemployed men are put up to sale weekly&#x2014;</quote>
this, my Lords, was in 1834&#x2014;
<quote>"and that the clergyman of the parish told him that he had seen ten men the last week knocked down to one of the farmers for 5s., and that there were at that time about seventy men let out in this manner out of a body of 170."</quote>
I think we may congratulate ourselves that those modes of meeting the difficulty are matters, not only of past history, but even of astonishment to people who cull them now from the records of what was happening seventy years ago. Again, take the kind of picture of Poor Law relief given in "Oliver Twist." The story was written, I think, in 1837 or thereabouts, and although no doubt over-coloured, it was based on a substantial foundation of what were then familiar facts. We have
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0605"/>
<col>1203</col>
got rid of these things for ever; but none the less action upon our part now is, I am convinced, urgently called for. Some of the main recommendations in the Report of the Royal Commission now before your Lordships are merely a repetition of what was recommended in 1834, and for one reason or another has not been carried out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02968">It was the unanimous sense of the need of a new departure which led five years ago to the appointment of the Royal Commission whose Report is now before the country. I doubt if there ever was a Commission more capable of doing the work assigned to it, more representative in its character and in the different kinds of knowledge desirable in Commissioners, or which did its work more thoroughly or was presided over by a wiser or more capable chairman. The Order of Reference to the Commission was in two different sentences. They were to inquire&#x2014;
<quote>"(1) Into the working of the laws relating to the <ob/>ief of poor persons in the United Kingdom;</quote>
<quote>"(2) Into the various means which have been adopted outside of the Poor Laws for meeting distress arising from want of employment, particularly during periods of severe industrial depression. And to consider and report whether any, and if so, what modification of the Poor Laws or changes in their administration or fresh legislation for dealing with distress are advisable."</quote>
I am confining myself in what I say to-day to the first of these two, for a reason which I will give in a moment. Immense pains have been taken by the Commission in the collection of its evidence. The only question that may occur to some of us is whether it is not too voluminous, so voluminous as to make it almost beyond the power of an ordinary man to master it with any thoroughness. I find some natural satisfaction in noting the warmth with which the Commissioners express their sense of the great help which they derived from the information, furnished to them through the Bishops, from every diocese in England as regards the unique experience which the parish clergy have of the way in which these difficulties are met both by the Poor Law and without it. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The reports [from the clergy] give us an interesting account of the condition of different parts of the country in respect to poverty. The reports also contain independent and valuable criticisms of the efficacy of the existing methods and agencies for relieving distress.&#x2026; The reports of the parochial enquiries form a most valuable body of independent local evidence which may be used for the purpose&#x2014;</quote>
<col>1204</col>
and it is a purpose for which they are urgently required&#x2014;
<quote>"of correcting the point of view of those actually engaged in the local Poor Law administration."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02969">The Commissioners, as I have already said, have presented a most weighty Report, or, rather, brace of Reports, to the public on these questions. It is difficult to imagine that such a Report, embodying with virtual unanimity recommendations so important, so definite, so practical, and so feasible, will not speedily be followed by action, and yet there are great obstacles standing across the path when we look forward to such action. There are three groups of objections offered to our going forward. There are those who say&#x2014;Things are not so very bad; on the whole, we get on fairly well. We want to screw up administrative efficiency and to keep an eye on sleepy local authorities; but the principles on which they are told to act and ought to act are sound, and it would be a great pity to disturb them. That has found expression in more than one quarter. Then there are those who say&#x2014;The subject is so vast and the people who are anxious for reform present it in such a far-reaching way that we are not prepared to face it. A third class say&#x2014;The propounders of the new plan are all at sixes and sevens; their recommendations are contradictory one to the other; let us wait till their counsels are practically unanimous. Each of those objections is capable of very definite answer, and I will say a word or two about each.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02970">As regards the first, there are abundant pages in the Report which show how very fallacious and misleading is any such statement. There is much to be thankful for in every part of England. It is impossible to over-estimate what the country owes to the body of men who as guardians or relieving officers are giving themselves night and day to the consideration of a most difficult subject, and one which involves often most thankless work. Their work is beyond all praise, and, whatever changes are brought about, it would be vital that we should retain the help of such men. On the other hand, there are grave defects apparent everywhere, and defects not easily remediable; I doubt if they are remediable at all under the present law. There is first the unmeaning and unjustifiable variety of policy and manner in which outdoor relief is dis-

<col>1205</col>
tributed. There are districts in London, in East London particularly, where by simply crossing the street you will find yourselves under a <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> entirely different from that on the other side. The odd numbers in the street are under one set of regulations and the even numbers under regulations completely different; and it is practically impossible that both of these for an identical population can be at the same time right. The same may be found through the country generally. The Commissioners in the strongest terms comment on the lack of any reasonably coherent or uniform principle. What they say on the subject is worth reading&#x2014;
<quote>"The results of our investigations into the history of out-relief, of our own observation in visiting boards of guardians in different parts of the country, and of the evidence given before us, may be summarised as follows:&#x2014;We have found a total want of principle and of uniformity in its administration, due, as we think, in part at least, to a lack of sufficient supervision. This want of uniformity does not necessarily arise from a difference in the circumstances of unions, but is generally the result of careless administration. We have been impressed by the inadequacy which often characterises it particularly in the case of widows with families, and by the absence of thorough knowledge of applicants on the part of boards of guardians, and sometimes even of their officers. We have had to record cases in which it was distributed with a complete disregard of sound policy, and, though rarely, on grounds, so far as we could judge, inconsistent with any high standard of administrative honesty. We have found that in few cases is any care or thought given to the conditions under which those who receive it are living. We do not recommend its abolition&#x2014;</quote>
that is, the abolition of out-door relief&#x2014;
<quote>"partly because we hope that, if our proposals are adopted, the need for it will gradually disappear, and, in any case, its mischiefs will be reduced to a minimum, and partly because we feel that time is needed for the development of a curative system of treatment, and that the abolition of out-relief might cause hardship."</quote>
That is their report as to the negative difficulties, but there are other parts of the Report in which they point out the harm which is being done in many regions by the way in which, free from any control, out-relief is being administered so as actually to foster and encourage things that are in themselves evil. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The following are some of the instances in which we have found that out-relief is being applied to subsidise dirt, disease, and immorality. An old Irishwoman, moving feebly about a room crowded with dirty lumber and herself in the last stages of dirt and decrepitude. She gets 3s. relief, pays 2s. 3d. rent, and has no other income except when
<col>1206</col>
she can get lodgers. She had two mill girls with her, one with a child, but the child was taken away with typhoid last week, and now she has no one. The place is hopelessly dirty and insanitary and ought to be closed."</quote>
It was kept from being closed by the relief given in that way. Then&#x2014;
<quote>"The worst case on the list was that of an old man aged sixty-five, living with prostitutes, who boarded and lodged him at 2s. 6d. a week. The committee granted this man (although he did not appear) 2s. 6d. a week, but he was warned he must move into a more respectable neighbourhood."</quote>
The Commissioners proceed&#x2014;
<quote>"T., married, with three children, is partly paralysed, and seems mentally deficient. His wife is crippled by rheumatism. The guardians allow 6s. per week for man and wife, and 6s. for the children. The tenement consists of two rooms &#x2026; and there are living in the house, in addition to the foregoing, Mrs. T.'s mother, one male lodger, about forty, and Mrs. T.'s sister with an illegitimate child. In these two rooms, it will be observed, there are five adults, three children, and one baby. I was told by the relieving officer that the guardians do not attach importance either to cleanliness, sanitation, decency, or the ordinary standards of morality. As a result of my own observation I am prepared to endorse the statement."</quote>
I mention these cases, the importance being that these are not cases merely, as I think we can see, of ineffective, mischievous, or mistaken action in a particular locality on the part of particular men, but rather that the difficulties of mending them are inherent in the working of the system as we have it to-day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02971">Other things which the Commissioners call attention to are the almost chaotic lack of principle as to the mode of relieving widows with children, and, again, the meaningless and mischievous differences which are found in different parts of England as concerns the treatment of the aged. The workhouse accommodation for the aged is in some case so dreary as to be absolutely appalling, while in others it is palatial. If we take a rough generalisation it may be said that the country workhouses are dreary, and that the palatial houses&#x2014;which are not necessarily more comfortable for the inmates&#x2014;are mainly in the large centres. Alluding to the results which sometimes follow from the absence of any system of classification, the Commissioners describe one workhouse, a sample of many others, as follows&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0607"/>
<col>1207</col>
<quote>"The inmates, over 900 in number, were congregated in large rooms, without any attempt to employ their time or cheer their lives. There was a marked absence of any human interest, and though the superintendent and matron impressed us favourably it was impossible to avoid feeling that the lives of the inmates were not merely wanting in colour, but were aimless and listless. On more than one occasion there have been offers from outside to brighten the Sunday service, but they have been refused by the guardians owing to religious difficulties. It could not be better described than as a 'human warehouse.' The dormitories, which in some cases accommodated as many as sixty inmates, were so full of beds as to make it impossible to provide chairs, or to walk, except sideways, between them."</quote>
Then there is the overlapping&#x2014;and here is, I think, the most important point of all, because it is a matter of principle&#x2014;the overlapping of the existing authorities. Half -a-dozen public departments in one and the same area manage their work in different ways, absolutely independent of one another. There are the sanitary authority, the education authority, municipal relief works, and many others, all of whose work may be applicable to the same family. It has been pointed out that a widow with children may have five different and wholly independent inspectors visiting her house in one day, all of them doing their duty in particular water-tight compartments of the administration with which they have to deal. These are not mere questions of slack or careless administration; they are difficulties which, as far as I can see, are inherent in our existing system. They are only curable by a big new process, of which the first requisite is a greater enlargement of the area which is placed under one authority. Thus only can the two results be arrived at of having a fairly uniform system of outdoor relief&#x2014;education, sanitary inspection, and the like&#x2014;and the classification of the indoor poor, not in mixed institutions, but by special institutions. That was recommended in 1834, but as the law now stands the amendment is, speaking generally, impossible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02972">The Report speaks strongly on the subject, but I attach even greater weight to a quotation which the Report gives from the evidence of some of the best workhouse masters and matrons, who, on behalf of their association, say this&#x2014;
<quote>"With proper classification of, and in, workhouses, it would be possible to treat each class of inmates on its merits, in more detail, with the result that to the deserving an almshouse system would present itself, while the treatment of the undeserving would be deterrent. If you give us
<col>1208</col>
all classes to look after as we have at present, you want expert knowledge on every point and expert administration on every point, and it is impossible, in the one house, with the one staff of officials, to get it. That is one reason why we request so strongly classification by workhouses as well as in workhouses."</quote>
In many cases the feeble-minded, the very old, little children, the sick, the immoral, all are lumped together under people who cannot possibly be experts in all those departments, but it is impracticable under our present system to manage them in any other or better way. I absolutely challenge the statement that these difficulties can be met except by a new system under a new law. The whole account which the Report gives renders it impossible to argue that all we need is a little stimulus and rather more administrative efficiency.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02973">I do not think I need say many words about the next branch of objection to going forward&#x2014;that the subject is so vast that we cannot face it. It is vast, but it is all departmented already. It is not like marching out into a trackless prairie or sailing over a sea that has never been charted. The thing is being dealt with and handled in departments already, although, for lack of legislation, not yet with much result in action. There has been a separate Royal Commission on the Feeble Minded; a Departmental Committee has reported on vagrants; the Government have promised to take up unemployment at once, and the speech of the President of the Board of Trade on that subject leaves us in no doubt that a Bill to deal with that particular question is actually on the stocks. It is not, therefore, a chartless sea or a vague wide area that we have to go upon, and I believe that once given the initial key to the situation which enlarged administrative areas would afford no practical difficulty need arise from the mere bigness of the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02974">One more point of objection frequently urged is that the Commissioners are all at variance, that their recommendations are widely contradictory, and that we must wait until they are more at one before we can follow their guidance. If we look at it practically, that allegation breaks down entirely. The main recommendations that are made are made by the whole of the Commissioners. Among these recommendations are&#x2014;The enlargement of the area of administration: The abolition of
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0608"/>
<col>1209</col>
the present boards of guardians as such: The ending of the system of <i>ad hoc</i> election to guardianship: and Classification by institutions and not in institutions. All these things hang together and are common to all the Commissioners. They are recommended by both the majority and the minority. Again, both bodies are in agreement in urging that the curative rather then the deterrent principle is the one which should always be kept in mind. With regard to existing voluntary charitable associations and efforts, the majority of the Commissioners attach more importance than the others to enlisting the co-operation and recognising the status of bodies and efforts of that kind, but on that point I can find no fundamental difference of principle whatever between the two.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02975">The majority and minority do diverge absolutely when they come to the question of the constitution of the boards or authorities who are to administer the help in the coming days, and the difference between the two needs to be very carefully stated. I think it is this. The majority propose that the powers and duties of the guardians should be transferred to statutory committees of the county and county borough councils working in co-operation with the existing committees established by law for cognate purposes&#x2014;health, education, and so on&#x2014;and that the manifold organisations which exist for the purpose of charitable voluntary aid should be correlated under proper authority and given a legal status in each of the new areas of administration. The minority of the Commissioners, on the other hand, propose to distribute the powers and duties of boards of guardians as follows. So far as the non-able-bodied are concerned, they would be handed over to the existing committees of the county and county borough councils&#x2014;for example, the existing education, health, asylums, and pensions committees; and their work is to be carried on under the supervision and, so far as I understand, the control of registrars of public assistance appointed by and responsible to the finance committees. The able-bodied are to be dealt with by a new organisation set up and controlled by the Board of Trade or a new Ministry of Labour.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02976">Between these two I am not to-day trying to discriminate, although I confess that I do not see how the existing
<col>1210</col>
authorities, even if enlarged, can take over all these varied duties without bringing about another form of overlapping and a reversion to the small areas which every one condemns. For instance, there are now more than 1,800 different sanitary authorities in England and Wales&#x2014;three times as many as the number of boards of guardians. The two rival suggestions&#x2014;and I am very far from under-rating the importance of their differences on this particular point&#x2014;are now before the country and before the Government. It is for the Government, when they come to devise a Bill, to decide which line they will adopt on that specific point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02977">I have, out of mercy and consideration to your Lordships, left untouched great tracts of the country which lies around the circumference of this subject, but about which there was plenty to be said had time and occasion served. Especially I am sorry to leave untouched the vitally important matter of the peril of our present plans of boy and girl employment, which are well called the blind alleys which lead to nowhere. May I read to your Lordships a few words from the weighty evidence that was given by our foremost thinker on such subjects, Professor Sadler? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Under the industrial and commercial conditions which now prevail, it is easy for a boy of thirteen or fourteen to find some kind of virtually unskilled work for which are offered wages that for the time seem high, and flatter his sense of being independent of school discipline and of home restraint. In this work there is often little mental or moral discipline, though it may involve long hours of deteriorating routine.&#x2026;.Such evidence, indeed, as is available, points to the conclusion that in some callings the uneducative use of adolescent unskilled labour is rapidly extending; but part of the apparent increase may be due to a growing sense of the importance of the subject and to the consequently closer attention with which it is being observed."</quote>
I should like to have dwelt on that subject. I am certain that nothing is more important as regards the bigger aspects of the whole problem we are dealing with. I have also put on one side all that concerns the question of adult employment. I have left that on one side because my object to-day has been to press for the necessity of action being taken with regard to the matter as a whole, and with regard to that branch of it the Government have already promised that action is shortly going to be taken.</p>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0609"/>
<col>1211</col>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02978">That is all. I must apologise for having spoken at such length. Here is the Report. In my judgment no country can afford to ignore such a Report, containing on the one hand so grave a revelation of things that are seriously amiss and, on the other hand, recommendations so definite for mending these things. Is the country, is His Majesty's Government, going to ignore the whole subject and let things alone? Think, my Lords, of the number of people who, as the Report shows, are suffering needlessly every single week, every single day, that we are letting this urgent duty slide. I decline to think that such can be the intention of those on whom the burden&#x2014;and it is a heavy burden&#x2014;of central responsibility in these matters rests. I at least have tried to do my part by calling attention to the need of action in a matter vitally affecting the credit and the well-being of a Christian country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02979"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to say a few words on this supremely important subject I am disposed to ask the indulgence of your Lordships. Placed as I am, with the daily duties of an office which certainly do not diminish in volume, added to special duties of this year, some connected with that office and some connected with the general business of the Government, I have been prevented from giving to the Report of the Poor Law Commission not merely that close study but what I think would be even more important, that careful thought which is necessary before it is possible to speak on it with any degree of adequacy. Therefore in the few observations I propose to make I shall confine myself in the main to general remarks arising out of what has been said by the most rev. Primate.<lb/>
We have all, I think, listened with admiration to the very clear, and, if he will allow me to say so, masterly statement of the most rev. Primate on this subject, and in what I have to say I have no quarrel with him on any point whatever in the course of his speech. We are indeed grateful to him for bringing the matter forward, because he and the other occupants of the Episcopal Bench have the unique advantage of having been brought into close personal contact with the problem to an extent and with an intimacy which
<col>1212</col>
cannot be claimed by, I think, any of the lay members of the House, even though they may have served on boards of guardians. Consequently everything which falls from that Bench, and in particular from the most rev. Primate, on this subject must carry the greatest weight in all parts of the House. This is a vast subject, although I agree with the most rev. Primate in being hopeful that it is not too vast to be dealt with in the immediate future.<lb/>
The risk which the most rev. Primate mentioned, that the magnitude of the question and the mass of official publications in regard to it may have almost a terrifying effect both on Governments and on the public is, no doubt, real. The aspect of the matter is rather like one of those great schemes of arterial drainage which are put forward from time to time, only to be perpetually postponed while the smaller cuts and canals are executed from time to time. But I do hope, my Lords, that as regards this Poor Law question the general sense of its urgency is so widespread that we shall escape the danger which was very properly pointed out by the most rev. Primate&#x2014;namely, that any action will be deferred until it is possible to say that the conditions have so far altered that the inquiry is out of date and that some fresh investigation may become necessary.<lb/>
The Royal Commission had its origin in the first place from the wave of unemployment in 1905, which produced the Unemployed Workmen Act passed by the Government of noble Lords opposite. That was the actual moving cause of the appointment of the Commission, although it is also true that there was a general sense that the time had come for inquiry into the entire subject. The Royal Commission was appointed at the close of the year 1905, and I desire to endorse everything that was said by the most rev. Primate of the debt we all owe especially to the chairman, Lord George Hamilton, but to all the members, who gave so much time and such endless labour, and who exhibited such remarkable sagacity in the conduct of the inquiry. It is true, as the most rev. Primate pointed out, that the mere preliminary of knowledge of the proceedings of that Commission demands the perusal of a volume of 1,200 large pages, and before anybody is entitled to say that he is really acquainted with the results
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0610"/>
<col>1213</col>
of the inquiry he will have to read many other of those volumes enumerated by the most rev. Primate.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate did not, I think, overstate the gravity of the existing position as pointed out in the comparisons which he drew, beginning from the year 1871 up to the present time, with the statistics of pauperism. He pointed out that there was in that cycle an average of some 747,000 paupers, and he might have added that in the ensuing cycle the number fell to 694,000; it was not until the cycle of 1896&#x2013;1906 that it rose again to 718,000; in 1907 it was 769,000, and last year it was 772,000. It is also material to mention that although the number remains very nearly the same, yet the cost of maintaining these paupers has nearly doubled. In 1871&#x2013;2 the charge was about &#x00A3;8,000,000; in 1895&#x2013;6 it was &#x00A3;10,200,000; in 1905&#x2013;6 it was upwards of &#x00A3;14,000,000. Those are serious figures and give food for serious thought.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate also pointed out with great force what is, perhaps, the most disheartening feature of the whole situation&#x2014;namely, the slight effect which our great moral and material progress in almost all other directions has had upon these statistics of pauperism. We now spend on education somewhere about &#x00A3;23,000,000. In the year 1905&#x2013;6 the sanitary services of the nation cost another &#x00A3;16,000,000, and the cost of living, so far as food is concerned, has gone down. House rents, it is true, have not, but so far as actual cost of living is concerned there has been all through this period a diminution. And although it is one of those things which it is very difficult to prove, those best qualified to judge would say that, speaking generally, wages are higher. The statistics of thrift are in themselves satisfactory. Both the friendly societies and the trade unions show an increase. But in spite of all those encouraging symptoms we still have this great and undiminishing mass of pauperism. I also ought to have added that the statistics of illegitimate births&#x2014;a most fruitful cause of pauperism as has always been supposed, have also steadily diminished without apparently affecting the general result. The only conclusion, I think, that can be reached from all this&#x2014;and it leaps to the eye in the Report of the Commissioners&#x2014;is that whatever may have been and whatever may be the merits of the system of 1834, that system has
<col>1214</col>
reached its limit. It has done all it can, and if you are to have any real improvement you must look for something else. The most rev. Primate spoke of the body of able-bodied paupers, the increase in whose number has been a disquieting feature, particularly of male able-bodied paupers, for although they only form a comparatively small fraction of the whole&#x2014;about onetenth&#x2014;yet the fact that they are so numerous as they are is, from the national point of view, one of the most serious features of the situation. Then there are paupers from old age, from sickness, from mental deficiency, and there are the body of sixty odd thousand child paupers.<lb/>
I do not propose to dwell at any length upon the various recommendations laid down in the two Reports, but I am particularly grateful to the most rev. Primate for having called attention to the marked amount of agreement which exists in those two Reports. It has become a somewhat unfortunate point in the discussions that have taken place on this subject that it seems to be generally assumed that there is a sharp division, almost amounting to hostility, between the two Reports, and that impression may, I am afraid, have been somewhat strengthened by the naturally enthusiastic attitude of some of those who are in favour of the particular recommendations of one or the other. But I greatly prefer, with the most rev. Primate, to dwell on the marked points of agreement which both exhibit. The most rev. Primate enumerated many of them. There is the general agreement for the abolition of boards of guardians. The most rev. Primate spoke, if he will allow me to say so, wisely on the position of the boards of guardians. We none of us, I hope, fall short in the gratitude which we feel to those who have given for many years this unpaid public service, very often of an extremely disagreeable and painful nature; and I am the last to deny that in many cases both boards of guardians and individual guardians have deserved indeed well of their country. But that fact must not blind us to the deficiencies of the system, and nobody who has been through the Report or who has had any other opportunities outside of acquiring a general knowledge of the subject can, I think, doubt that in making this recommendation the Commissioners have done what was not merely desirable but what will prove to be absolutely necessary when the subject comes to be dealt with.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0611"/>
<col>1215</col>
Then the two Reports also agree on the abolition of general workhouses. They agree, in the main, in the character of the classification which ought to take place, and when the most rev. Primate reminded us that some of the recommendations of 1834 had not been entirely carried out in the long interval from that year to this we should remember that classification was one of those recommendations. It is also true that the general spirit of attempting to cure rather than deter is obvious in both the Majority and the Minority Reports, and both also lay stress on the necessity of investigating single individual cases by co-operation with private and other agencies. Both also agree in the necessity, in the last resort, that recourse must be had to compulsion in the treatment of certain cases of poor relief, and there are various other common grounds. It is no doubt true&#x2014;and I think it is this feeling which has given rise to the general belief in the diametrically opposite character of the Reports&#x2014;that there is a certain difference of approach evident as between the Majority and Minority Reports. I do not know that it would be more inaccurate than generalisations are apt to be if one were to say that the Report of the Majority in the main seeks to develop the sense of individual responsibility, while the Report of the Minority rather tends towards giving a stimulus to the consciousness of social obligation. But be that as it may, I think it is reasonable to conceive that the recommendations of neither Report may be absolutely perfect, that there is a great deal of the utmost value in both, and that when the time comes for the matter to be dealt with by legislation the recommendations of both ought to receive the most careful consideration of the Government who have to frame that measure, and I would venture to prophesy that it is not likely that either will be accepted in its absolute entirety.<lb/>
I do not know that it is necessary to attempt to follow the whole course of the recommendations even in the broadest way. As regards the care of the children of the State, as they are sometimes called, both the Reports favour the adoption of the less formal and institutional methods which have been in vogue in the past. Attention is called to the fact that the system of boarding out within the union has been hitherto not properly supervised, and I mention that point in particular because it is&#x2014;and I think this is important to note&#x2014;one of those which can be dealt with by
<col>1216</col>
administrative action without having recourse to legislation. I say it is important to bear that in mind because this is by no means the only instance; and whereas the great bulk of the subject may, as I say, make it alarming, it is evident that the more that can, so to speak, be pared off that bulk by administrative action before there is any question of further legislation, the easier the subject will be to deal with. Therefore, as regards the question of boarding out, my right hon. friend the President of the Board is preparing a circular for the appointment of committees for the purpose of supervising children so boarded out, which I hope will have the effect of making their care as complete as that of children boarded out without the union, who as we know, can regard themselves as well looked after. Again, the Local Government Board have been able to remove a considerable number of sick and convalescent children from the care of the Poor Law and to place them under the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and I think some 500 have been placed in the children's infirmary at Carshalton within a short period.<lb/>
Then as regards the pauperism of the aged, I need not remind the House of what has been done with reference to old age pensions. That, of course, does not, and even if extended will not, entirely extinguish the pauperism of old age so far as that pauperism is of an invalid character, but it does represent a serious dealing, as we all agree, with one important side of the question. The most rev. Primate carefully and explicitly left out of his speech the question of unemployment, and he did so on the specific ground that the President of the Board of Trade had announced in May last that His Majesty's Government hoped to bring forward a scheme for insurance against unemployment. That insurance, I may briefly remind the House, would be found by contributions from the workers and from the employers, supplemented by a grant from the State. The insurance would be by trades, and would be absolutely compulsory upon all workers in those trades. In addition to that, of course, we have the Labour Exchanges measure, which has already received the sanction of your Lordships and which we hope will do something to diminish the terrible evil of able-bodied pauperism. I think I may venture to say that so far as this important side of the matter is concerned we have been dealing, and are dealing, with it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0612"/>
<col>1217</col>
I do not think that the most rev. Primate or the House will expect me to say anything very definite as to what our hopes may be of dealing with the whole question. I can assure him we are fully alive to all the considerations which tell against postponement and which he stated so forcibly, but we have to consider the somewhat varied and exciting Parliamentary possibilities of the situation, and under these circumstances I should be a very rash prophet if I were to attempt to say anything as to what our hopes may be of how or when we should be able to deal with the other side of this question. What I do feel is that the hopes that it will be grappled with&#x2014;I will put it in that way and not say that we will grapple with it&#x2014;are largely increased by the fact that it is in no sense a question which divides parties. I am confident that although noble Lords opposite might not apply precisely the methods of treatment which we should desire to apply, yet they are not less alive than we are to the necessity of dealing with the situation. And believing this, I do venture to express the hope that within what the most rev. Primate would describe as a reasonable time it may be possible to cover this field of action, vast, indeed, though it is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02980"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure every one in the House will have heard with satisfaction the words with which the noble Earl concluded his speech. Perhaps it will be almost paradoxical to say that the condition of the House this evening evidently justifies the most rev. Primate in the course he has taken in raising this debate, for to-night has not shown any very widespread public interest represented here; it has shown what I imagine to have been in his mind&#x2014;the necessity of all of us in our different places steadily going on saying that the publication of this Report means a great opportunity and a great obligation and that it stands quite in the front rank of matters of public duty. I think it might be said, without exaggeration, that the good which in the judgment of one side of the House would be accomplished by the passage of the Budget, or the harm which in the judgment of the other side of the House would be done by the same event, would not be greater than what would be done, good or harm, by the effectual handling on the one side or by the neglect on the other of the issues raised by these Reports.<lb/>
<col>1218</col>
The most rev. Primate, in the early part of his speech, took us back into regions where probably the historical knowledge of most of us was quite unable to follow, and produced for us certain singularly racy and interesting extracts from the earlier history of the treatment of this question. He gave us instances of the strange way in which charity at one period was made compulsory on individuals, and at another period the fanner was compelled to provide employment, and he asked us to note the very strange and ill-judged methods which were then employed. But I cannot help feeling that when we look back at events of that kind we are in somewhat the same position as those who when they are discussing modern warfare point to the clumsy old matchlocks or the curious swords that were once employed and say "We at any rate have got past that." It seemed to me that those instances brought home to our minds that in their old-fashioned way men of former generations had a stronger sense that matters of this kind must be dealt with, and dealt with by the community, than we find now. It has always seemed to me that, probably by reaction from some ill-judged methods of the past, there has been dominant throughout our lifetime in general opinion an idea that most things which affect poverty and so on come to pass, and that you cannot much affect them by anything that you do, except perhaps by the preaching of virtue and by all those influences which tend to raise public morality. It is there, surely, that we begin to see more and more that that was wrong, that we ought more and more to interfere; and what is very satisfactory is that we are not discovering this, if I see rightly, in a theoretical or doctrinaire way, but that we are largely learning it along the way of wholesome and successful practice&#x2014;that is to say, in these Reports our attention is drawn to what probably only a few of the more expert among us realised before, namely, the amount which Parliament has done in the way of organised treatment of different parts of this subject.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has just sat down said, if I understood him rightly, that he is very disappointed that, in spite of that, we find so little accomplished. I think probably that is really because we do not picture to ourselves what would have happened if those improvements in administration had not taken place. I allude specially to all the work of public health and the treatment
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0613"/>
<col>1219</col>
in special institutions of those who need such treatment. Coming to the matters which seem now most to challenge administrative change, I think I am right in saying that first there is the country question. Nothing, I think, seems to come out more clearly than that it is impossible for bodies like boards of guardians to deal with large parts of this subject, which indeed cannot be dealt with on a small scale. Therefore, so far as that goes, we need not discuss <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> how much of the eulogiums and how much of the strictures that have attached to the action of those bodies is justifiable, because whether they have done well or ill, it still is necessary to bring into action a larger authority which could deal on an ampler scale and so deal more systematically with the classification and treatment of the poor.<lb/>
But the other question with which I have more to do is that of the towns. What I have felt, certainly since I have had to deal with the great masses in South London, is that probably outside people hardly realise what has grown up and what is inaccessible either to the forces of private effort or the unaided forces of municipal effort. I was talking the other day to a clergyman who had been working in the outskirts of one of our large towns, and he was very much struck with the change that had passed over his district within the memory of one generation. Thirty, or forty, or fifty years ago the place had been practically looked after by a great manufacturing family, highly thought of in the community, rich and benevolent in its action, and it was said that there could hardly have been a case of distress in that township which was not known to and probably assisted by this great house. But the town has grown to be one of the vastest in this country. The employers have gone to live outside, the personal house has been transferred to a company, and now you have on that same area a much larger population and a population which there is no like instrument to deal with efficiently. In South London, in dealing with the needs of the poor, I see&#x2014;I was going to say not a little, but I think that word would be inadequate&#x2014;I see a great deal of private charity both in money and in kind. There have been developed within my time organisations, such as settlements of educated men and women, to mention one example, which have done a great deal of the kind
<col>1220</col>
of work most wanted to be done. There is a great deal of that work and it is better organised than it used to be, but it is still very sporadic and very uncertain. But what I think is most important to recognise is this, that where there is action of that kind on the part of individuals and societies, efficient public action on a larger scale would be not least but most welcome. I think that if a foreigner were to read these Reports he would be struck with the fact that both of them alike were genuinely English in the way in which they rely upon, and propose that we should continue in the future to rely upon, such private benevolent action.<lb/>
Municipal action among our London masses cannot be expected to go beyond a certain point in its range and reach. Everyone knows that it is very difficult to man the machinery. The number of men who are present there with leisure to give and the higher kind of training for the purpose is very limited. Men and women have done splendid work upon the local municipal bodies, but I cannot help seeing that the problems of London life&#x2014;labour, poverty, disease, and so forth&#x2014;are much too vast and complex to be dealt with except by the very best central strength that we have. Therefore I do want very much to see this putting out more power. In these times, when every day in every company the topic of Socialism is foremost in the minds of men, I wish we could resolutely distinguish between questions which concern municipalisation or nationalisation, or what not, of means of employment and other questions involving the steady, quiet increase of the action of the State in an administrative way. I am quite aware of the dangers that attend that action; I am quite aware of the danger&#x2014;I hear it often spoken of in our London life in the field of education&#x2014;of a bureaucratic system; but I cannot help feeling that those dangers are not so great as the danger of leaving undealt with things which can only be dealt with by a central authority.<lb/>
We surely do want a great extension&#x2014;here the Reports are most eloquent, and, I think, most touching&#x2014;a great extension of curative action, which forestalls mischief and so saves to us physically and morally a great number of lives which are now wasted. Such a result as that, if it be
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0614"/>
<col>1221</col>
possible&#x2014;and I think it is possible&#x2014;is surely well worth a little infringement of the principles of independence and so on, to which we sometimes, I think, attach not only their full value, but a little more. I was very much struck by the fact that a former chief magistrate of my own borough&#x2014;the borough of Southwark&#x2014;sent for me a little while ago and said he was so deeply impressed with the way in which phthisis was making havoc in the younger population that he wanted, if he could, during his mayoralty to do something to check the harm that it did. There was the case of a man very fully occupied with his own business and with the care of administration, but upon whose mind this had been borne home. I take it, therefore, that if we were resolute, and if we gave the right powers in the right way and quite in a line with what we have done in our action concerning health authorities, we could probably do a great deal to save life.<lb/>
Speedy, thoughtful action is required from Parliament for the treatment of the whole subject of boy labour. Three or four years ago, when there was one of the special waves in the movement for social reform, I remember attending a meeting in a hall not far from here on the subject. The meeting was addressed by one who I think, in this or in any place, deserves the best tribute of admiration and gratitude that we can give&#x2014;I mean Canon Barnett of Westminster. I remember well how he put aside all the vaguer propositions on which other speakers had dwelt and concentrated himself on the one subject of the wastage which went on between the years of school life and adult life. Ever since then I have felt with increasing conviction that Canon Barnett had put his finger on the spot, and I see that these Reports justify that to the very full. The Reports of the Commission touch all spheres of life. They touch the matter of unemployment, because every one who looks at the matter now agrees that it is largely this unskilled boy labour which is recruiting the ranks of the unemployed. Nothing has been more marked among Christian bodies of late years than the concentration of effort upon this class, but I think I shall speak for all the representatives of our religious bodies if I say that here again we feel that what we and those who work for us are able to do would be much more efficient if the whole subject were
<col>1222</col>
handled with more vigour by Parliament and public authorities. It is said that action of this kind would lead to a great deal of expense. I coast there along the edge of controversial questions, but I only do so to make the remark, which surely is an innocent and obvious remark, that we should there, if we spent a great deal of money, save a great deal of money too, and along with the money we should save we should save things which are more valuable than money.<lb/>
I have not dared to speak at any length on the question of the unemployed, though I do not think that I should be faithful to my knowledge if I did not say that I am quite sure this question is gaining in genuine urgency. I use the word "genuine" urgency, because I am quite aware that it is a question into which a spurious and artificial urgency can to a degree be imported. I say it is gaining in genuine urgency in such districts as those with which I have to do. Nothing, I think, more stirs the indignation of one who at all knows the matter than the phrase, too often current upon men's lips, that the unemployed are really unemployable. That is an untrue saying, and it is a cruel saying. It is untrue because it turns a partial truth into a general truth. Of course, there are large numbers of unemployable among the unemployed, but workers in South London know home after home where the real, honest, genuine worker sits craving for work. But that is not the worst of it. They know the way in which, early and late, he pads the streets, wearing out the soles of his boots trying to find work. It is not only an untrue but a cruel saying, because many of those who are unemployable need not have been so. They are unemployable not only by their own fault, for there are many of them for whose condition the community are entirely responsible. These Reports show us how we of the community have made many of these unemployables, and therefore it is cruel to throw their unemployableness in their face. How much we can do I do not know, but I do feel most hopeful that if we can in the sort of way suggested by the Commissioners tackle the question of unemployment and break it up, we may be able to do a good to the community at large, and to the most hard pressed and suffering classes of that community greater, perhaps, than we at this time hardly dare to hope.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HANDLOOM WEAVING BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02981" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02982">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-02983"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the absence of my noble friend Lord Pirrie, who was in charge of this Bill, I have the honour to submit the measure to your Lordships and to ask that you will give it a Second Reading. Although I shall not be able to do so with the knowledge of the subject possessed by my noble friend, I hope your Lordships will extend your indulgence to me while I state in the barest outline the object of the Bill. There exists in Ireland an industry of weaving in a handloom linen damask goods, and that industry is one which gives employment to a considerable number of persons, particularly in the North of Ireland. There is supposed to be, and there undoubtedly is, a superiority in these handwoven products over similar products made by power looms, and the practice of occasionally trying to pass off goods which have been made by machinery as goods which have been made by hand is not altogether unknown. I think your Lordships will appreciate that that practice is really a double deception, because the purchaser is deceived and the maker of these goods is also damnified by a competition which is unfair. The object of this measure is to provide a remedy for that state of things. The first clause provides that all those goods which are made by handloom shall be marked in a manner which will make that clear. The second clause provides that goods which are not so made shall not be so marked and that it shall be an offence to so mark them. I think the object of that should commend itself to the House. When I add that although this is an Irish Bill dealing with an Irish subject it has commanded universal assent in another place, I think your Lordships will believe that that is an overwhelming reason for according it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-02985"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I am personally connected with the Province of Ulster and especially with the county of Down in which handloom weaving forms a prominent part of the important industry of the linen trade,
<col>1224</col>
I cordially support the Bill. Not only has the Bill passed unanimously through the other House, but it has received the support of the Unionist Members who represent the Province of Ulster. As the noble Earl has mentioned, handloom weaving is superior to that done by machinery, and consequently it is but right that those who purchase these goods should know whether the linen they buy has been made by hand or not. I do not know that there has been any great amount of linen passed off under false colours, but the present state of the law does give opportunities for that to be done. There is another reason why I support this Bill.<lb/>
In the county of Down, where, as I have said, this is an important industry, we notice a very great decline, almost a decay, in handloom weaving. I have only this afternoon had placed in my hands some statistics which bear this out. In Waringstown, which is in the centre of the hand weaving linen trade, there were in the year 1881, 1,730 houses; in 1901 the number was reduced to 1,521. The population in 1881 was 7,902, but in the year 1901 it had been reduced to 6,036. These are serious figures as showing the decay in this trade. I think the Lord-Lieutenant a short time ago visited Waringstown and promised the people there that steps should be taken for the introduction of a Bill such as this. A number of the people who work at the handloom also have small holdings, but they could not live upon the holdings without the work of the handloom, and, consequently, if they can no longer obtain employment at this industry they will have to give up their holdings and make their way into the cities adding to the number of the unemployed or else emigrate from Ireland. The handlooms also give employment to old people who otherwise could not find employment, and if handloom weaving ceases these old people must eventually go into the workhouse. The Bill, therefore, is a useful one not only in the interests of honesty of trade but also in the interests of the population, and I hope your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SECRETARY OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03000" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03001">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03002"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this measure is one which has passed in another place without opposition, and I venture to hope that its fate will be equally fortunate in your Lordships' House. For some time past there has been a feeling that the Board of Agriculture, although administered in turn by Statesmen of the highest capacity and experience, has not quite taken the place among public Offices to which its intrinsic importance undoubtedly entitles it. It deals with what, after all, remains our greatest national industry, and we should all agree, I think, especially in this House, that the Office which is concerned with that industry ought to be and to be treated as one of the first importance. It is proposed by this Bill to create a Secretary to the Board. As your Lordships know, the work of the Board in another place has been carried out, I think with general acceptance, by a gentleman who holds an office in His Majesty's Household; but it is felt, and I trust your Lordships will agree, that it is desirable that the representation as it now happens in another place should
<col>1228</col>
be placed on a more regular footing, and it is with that object that this Bill is introduced. I ask your Lordships to give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03003">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Crewe</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03004"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad that His Majesty's Government have introduced this Bill. I have been very much in the same position as the noble Earl who is now President of the Board of Agriculture is in at the present moment. I have had to rely upon the services of a member of His Majesty's Household in the House of Commons, and I am bound to say that the duties which he discharged were discharged in the most efficient manner. At the same time there is no doubt a feeling in the House that if a Minister is not connected with the Department, with access to all the Papers, he does not represent the Department in the same fulness and with the same force as if he were the Secretary of the Department. The noble Earl said that for the moment the Board was represented in the other House by a gentleman who was not connected with it. By that I suppose he meant that the time might come when the President of the Board would be in the other House of Parliament and the Secretary would have to be in this. I think it would be a great advantage that we should always have in this House a representative of the Board of Agriculture. When I say that, I think it applies even more strongly to some of the other Departments, and I think it is a little singular that at the present moment we have no representative of the Foreign Office in this House. I cannot recollect a time since I have had the honour of a seat in your Lordships' House when there has been no representative here of the Foreign Office. Nor is there any direct representative of the Home Office or of the Admiralty. I am aware that it has always been a practice that some of the Departments should be represented in this House by some of those who hold office in His Majesty's Household, but I hope this Bill is an augury of good, and that His Majesty's Government will be led by the reception which this Bill has received to feel that the House desires that there should be a direct representative of all the important Departments, not only in the other House of Parliament, but also in this.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-03005"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to offer any opposition on this Bill, but I think that in the circumstances of the present moment the Bill ought not to be allowed to pass altogether without remark. In the raising of salaries of offices, in the creation of new offices, and in expenditure generally, the present Government have had no rival among any of the Governments that I can recollect; and if all their schemes at present in existence are carried out I am sure this country will be possessed of a bureaucracy such as it has never before enjoyed in its history, and His Majesty's Government will have earned the undying gratitude of all professions, such as valuers, doctors, and people of that sort, for whom unlimited places will have been created. I do not take exception to this particular instance of it because, as the noble Earl has said, it is quite right to have a Secretary to the Board of Agriculture; but I want to ask the noble Earl who leads the House whether when this Bill was drawn up there was any idea of another Bill which has just been introduced into your Lordships' House, and which, I suppose, at some time or other we may be asked to consider. The noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies has so many things to do&#x2014;I am sure I am very sorry for him&#x2014;that he may very likely not have had time to observe that his colleague who sits near him (Lord Pentland) has just introduced a Bill by which he proposes to take away the Scottish portion of the work of the Board of Agriculture from his colleague Lord Carrington. It appears to me that if half the business of the office is to be taken away, what we ought to be considering is rather whether Lord Carrington's salary ought not to be reduced than a proposal to give him a Secretary. But very likely this Bill may have been introduced and entered on your Lordships' Journals without any reference to Lord Carrington, because, as we know, there is very little communication between some of His Majesty's Departments under the present Administration. However that may be, if the Bill is brought forward, there will no doubt be some criticism in your Lordships' House and it is not necessary for me to make any now. But I should like to know whether, when it was proposed to create this new position of Secretary of the Board of Agriculture, it was known that it was proposed to create an additional Office
<col>1230</col>
with regard to agriculture in Scotland which would deprive the present Office of a very considerable part of its duties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03006"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can answer the noble Earl's question very easily. I am greatly obliged to him for the sympathy which he expressed so kindly for me regarding my multifarious duties, which I am afraid are more than I can properly carry out; but as regards this particular point I might refer the noble Earl to the debate which took place on the Second Reading of this Bill in another place. He will see there that the question of the Bill which has been read a first time on the motion of my noble friend behind me (Lord Pentland) was fully discussed, and that it certainly was with the full cognisance of everybody concerned with the production of this Bill that the Scottish Bill was also introduced. The two, as I think the noble Earl will see, are by no means incompatible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-03010"><member>LORD FARQUHAR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the object of the Bill, the Second Reading of which I beg to move, is to extend to municipal elections the provisions of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1895, by which a summary method is provided of punishing persons making false statements of fact, relating to the personal character or conduct of a candidate, for the purpose of affecting the result of the election. The Act of 1895 has worked very well and has proved very effective in stopping malicious calumnies about Parliamentary candidates, which were frequently circulated just before an election, too late to be contradicted. This Bill proposes to extend this protection to municipal candidates. So important are the administrative powers which are now wielded by municipalities that it has become essential to secure the purity of municipal elections, that they should be honourably conducted on public and not on private issues, and that the
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0619"/>
<col>1231</col>
candidates should be protected from false statements affecting their character and conduct. Against such false statements the municipal candidate has at present no remedy except an action for slander, in which it is generally necessary to prove special damage, and which would not be heard for months after the election. It is absolutely necessary that those who utter such slanders should be dealt with promptly, and the Bill provides a rapid and effective remedy by summary procedure under which offenders can be dealt with immediately and the circulation of the slanders stopped. It not only provides a remedy, but will act as a deterrent. The Bill constitutes the making or publishing of any such false statements an illegal practice which involves a penalty on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;100, with incapacity for five years of being registered as an elector within the constituency, and in the case of an offence made with the knowledge or consent of a candidate, renders his election void. The Bill is non-controversial, and should receive the support and sympathy of all quarters of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

The Corrupt Practices Act is confined to Parliamentary elections, and the purpose of it is to prevent cowardly and mean statements about the personal character of, or personally about, the candidate at any time during an election. Conduct of that kind is not common, I am glad to say, in this country; but cases not infrequently occurred, and the worst of it was that these lies were circulated just before the poll and when there was no opportunity for contradiction. The Act was passed when I was a member of the House of Commons, and there was a general feeling that mean conduct of that kind ought to be promptly stopped, and the Act was passed for that purpose. Its effect has been admirable in connection with Parliamentary elections, and there seems no reason why it should not be extended to municipal elections.</membercontribution></p>

Under that Act Colonial Legislatures were permitted to raise Volunteers belonging to the Royal Naval Reserve under the Royal Naval Reserve Act of 1859. It is now desired to give an alternative power to Colonial Legislatures to raise Volunteers who should form part of the Royal Fleet Reserve under the Naval Forces Act of 1903. This is effected by Clause 1 of the Bill. The Legislatures of the Cape and Natal have already passed Acts for this purpose, and Clause 1 of this Bill validates these Colonial enactments. The Act of 1865 enables Colonial Legislatures to make provision for providing vessels of war and maintaining seamen to man them and placing these at the disposal of the Admiralty; but the officers serving therein can only be employed on ships belonging to the Colony. This Bill is to remedy these defects, and I trust that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-03031"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a second Bill for the creation of a new office. I observe that the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, is not in the House, or I should be afraid of incurring some further censure from him in respect of the subject-matter of this Bill. I cannot help feeling that it may even be that the contemplation of it has been too much for him, and he has felt it necessary to withdraw from the House in consequence. On the general question which was raised by the noble Earl I should like to say this. We must all agree that the multiplication of offices ought to be carefully watched, but I think each case must stand on its own merits; and if it can be shown, as I think it can be
<col>1234</col>
shown, that both in the case of the Board of Agriculture and of the Post Office the volume of work is so great that it demands two regular Parliamentary representatives to conduct it in the two Houses, it seems to me that the case for each may be considered as proved. When the present Postmaster-General came into office he found that the volume of work at the Post Office was so great that it was more than he could conduct in his own person, and he therefore asked the Prime Minister for some regular assistance. He received that assistance from my noble friend the Master of the Horse, who has not only conducted the small amount of business connected with the Post Office in this House, but has also undertaken, very capably if I may be allowed to say so, a large amount of office work to an extent of which your Lordships may not be altogether aware. So far as the work of the Office is concerned, that is all quite satisfactory; but here, again, it does seem due to the ever-increasing importance of the Post Office Department to place matters on a regular footing, and in order that that may be done legislation is required. As your Lordships know, it is a regular constitutional rule that holders of salaried offices cannot sit in Parliament, and in any case where they are allowed to sit in Parliament it is only because of a Statute which explicitly permits of their doing so. Therefore, although the Postmaster-General, under the Post Office Act, can appoint such officers as he pleases and can assign salaries to them, yet it is not possible for him <i>proprio motu</i> to appoint officers who are able to sit in Parliament. That, my Lords, is the origin of this Bill, and I hope it will receive the same measure of support which your Lordships were good enough to give to the parallel Bill in respect of the Board of Agriculture.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1235</col>
Clause 2 (Establishment of Trade Boards for trades to which Act applies), which were agreed to, proposed an Amendment to Clause 5 (Order giving obligatory effect to minimum rates of wages), subsection (4), to meet the criticism of the Marquess of Salisbury during the Committee proceedings. The general effect of the Bill was that every rate which was fixed by a Trade Board had to go to the Board of Trade for confirmation, but subsection (4) of Clause 5 enabled the Board of Trade to dispense with that process when they thought desirable. What would happen then would be that after the expiry of six months the rate would automatically come as a compulsory rate into force. The Government thought then, and still thought, that that was an extremely useful provision, but the noble Marquess regarded it as the giving of a blank cheque by the Board of Trade. The noble Marquess pointed out that though by the concluding words of the subsection the Board of Trade had power to recover the right of postponing the compulsory operation of the rate, yet they had not the right of postponing a compulsory rate in any particular case&#x2014;they could only do so generally. To meet that criticism, and after consultation with the noble Marquess, it was proposed to add the following words to the subsection:&#x2014;"Unless in any particular case the Board of Trade, on the application of any person interested, direct to the contrary." These words would enable the Board of Trade to postpone the compulsory operation of any particular rate if representations were made to them by anybody interested and connected with the trade that they might be injured by that rate. In that way, they thought they would have all the advantage of allowing the trade to manage its own affairs if it was capable of doing so, and, at the same time, if it should seem to be necessary, it would be possible for the Board of Trade to interfere and prevent any injustice being done.</p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-03037"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he was much obliged to the noble Lord for the Amendment, which was an improvement in the Bill. This subsection was a very remarkable one, and one which had
<col>1236</col>
never appeared in any Act before. It was especially remarkable because it dealt with what was avowed on all hands to be a great experiment&#x2014;a great experiment in trades of a much smaller character than many with which they were acquainted in this country, and which dealt with work-people who were poor, ill-educated, of humble position, and quite unable to protect themselves; and in respect of some of these trades the Government proposed in this subsection that a general power should be given to the experimental Trade Boards to make whatever minimum rate of wages they chose without any control from the Board of Trade. That was the original proposal; the only control was that if they misused the power it could be taken away. The Amendment which Lord Hamilton had now moved did not go so far as he would have liked, but it was certainly a substantial concession.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03038"><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said he was glad that the Government had seen their way to propose this Amendment on the suggestion of the noble Marquess. If he was not out of order, he would like to explain at this stage why no Amendment to Clause 6 stood on the Paper in his name. It would be within the recollection of their Lordships that in Committee he proposed an Amendment to Clause 6 with a view of meeting the difficulty which was certain to arise of evasion through the agency of middlemen. That Amendment met with a good deal of sympathy, and was only withdrawn on the promise of the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that the matter should have further consideration. He would like to express his obligation to the noble Lord for the courtesy he had since shown him in placing much information on this point at his disposal, and also in giving him the advantage of being able to confer with the officials of the Board of Trade on the subject. As the result of a fairly prolonged conference with those gentlemen he had come to the conclusion that, on the whole, the best course was not to try to amend the Bill on this point. Though the representatives of the Board were prepared to meet him to the extent of accepting one or two alternative forms of Amendment, they preferred the Bill as it was with its imperfections. As it would almost certainly be necessary to introduce an amending Act he had decided to wait until they could be guided by

experience as to what provisions were required. The Bill, with its admitted incompleteness, would have a considerable effect in preventing sweating and in showing the great interest which Parliament took in the matter.</p>

<image src="S5LV0002P0I0623"/>
<col>1239</col>
now proposed to reintroduce the clause with this difference, that, instead of being done by the authority of the Government simply, this transfer of powers to another Department should only take place by Order in Council. He did not think that that contained the whole of Viscount St. Aldwyn's case. In any event it was evident that the words "by Order in Council" standing by themselves were merely a matter of form, and did not make the clause differ substantially from the one which their Lordships struck out in Committee. He did not think they would do well to agree to the clause unless further explanation was given. What kind of case were the Government contemplating? Why was it right to take powers from the Board of Trade, and to what other Department could they be given? Possibly there might be some advantage in allowing the exercise of these novel powers by the Home Office, for that Department, like the Board of Trade, commanded public confidence. But what reason could there be for transferring the powers from one Department to another? The Board of Trade was fully cognisant of these trade matters and had experienced officials accustomed to deal with points analogous to those that might arise under the operation of the Bill. He knew from experience that the Board of Trade exercised a real power in all these questions. When a power was given to the Board it was used. Let them take, for example, the power of sanctioning loans. The Board of Trade had that power and took precautions to ascertain that local authorities had a good case for borrowing before giving their sanction. He did not think other Departments exercised the same care. The Local Government Board had sinned most profoundly in that respect and had allowed local authorities to borrow recklessly. He confessed that in a similar way he had very little confidence in the Board of Education in matters of this kind. But in the Board of Trade they had confidence. He did not think the Government would be well advised in allowing the transfer of these powers to any other Department, but if they could make good a case for the Home Office the words "Secretary of State" might be substituted for "any other Government Department."</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03055"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess will, I think, admit that my noble friend behind me has tried to meet him and noble Lords opposite as far as possible in the course of the conduct of this Bill.
<col>1240</col>
The objection which was taken by noble Lords opposite, as we understood it, to this provision on the former occasion was in relation to the fact that there was no precedent for taking this power otherwise than by Order in Council, and my noble friend behind me thought that by securing that point he had met the objections of noble Lords opposite. The noble Marquess has made it clear that that is not entirely the case. I do not know exactly what fears the noble Marquess has in his mind. It is not, I think, likely that so competent a Department as the Board of Trade would lightly part with any of its powers under this Act to any Department which was not immediately or specially concerned. The noble Marquess, however, was undoubtedly right in assuming that the office which the Government especially had in mind in speaking of these transfers was the Home Office. The Home Office obviously have close connection in relation to the Factory Acts with matters which come within the purview of this Bill. Factory inspectors, for instance, are very likely to be employed as assistants under the power given, I think, by Clause 14 of this Bill, to bring in expert assistance in relation to these Boards. Since the noble Marquess specially desires to confine its operation to the Home Office His Majesty's Government will not stand out on the matter, but will accept the Amendment in the form which the noble Marquess suggests.</membercontribution></p>

What we are face to face with is a proposal that very wide and far-reaching powers, which we are quite prepared to extend to the expert Department which really understands these matters, should be delegated to any other Department. I am very glad that the noble Earl has admitted that we are reasonable in deprecating that course, and I think we shall all consider that the Bill has been improved if he will allow the clause to run in the way suggested by my noble friend.

<title>MARINE INSURANCE (GAMBLING<lb/> POLICIES) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03062" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03063">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03064"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am almost ashamed to ask your Lordships to consider another insurance Bill before we have got rid of the one which is already on the Paper, but I make bold to do so because I believe that this is a Bill which will meet with a very general measure of acceptance. Its object is to put a stop to gambling in marine insurance policies&#x2014;a practice which there is reason to believe has been carried on to a very considerable extent lately and with results which have been far from satisfactory.<lb/>
I think that first of all I ought to define what a gambling policy of this kind is. Under Section 1 of the Marine Insurance Act of 1906 a contract of marine insurance is defined as a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the insured against marine losses&#x2014;that is to say, a contract of marine insurance is a contract of indemnity. Under Section 4 of the Act it is laid down that every contract of marine insurance by way of gaming or wagering is void; and in subsection (2) of that clause it is stated that any contract of marine insurance is deemed to be a wagering contract (a) where the assured has no insurable interest in the ship or cargo, and (b) where it is stipulated that no further proof than the policy shall be
<col>1242</col>
required of the existence of such an interest. The ordinary business of marine insurance is done by the owner of the vessel or by some person who has a clearly defined interest in the ship or cargo.<lb/>
But besides these transactions a considerable amount of business is done in what are known as P.P.I. policies, those initials standing for the words "Policy Proof of Interest." These policies are gaming contracts within the meaning of Section 4 of the Marine Insurance Act, and, as such, claims under them cannot be enforced at law in the event of a dispute. Their position in the eye of the law is exactly the same as that of a bet in every way. But, as a matter of fact, these honour policies, as they are called, are never disputed. They are invariably paid by the underwriters when claims under them fall due, in exactly the same way as very large sums of money change hands every Monday morning&#x2014;sums which are equally irrecoverable at law, and which change hands as the result of a week's racing. These P.P.I. policies are used for two purposes. One of these purposes is a perfectly legitimate one, with which we do not wish to interfere. The other is an illegitimate use, and a use which there is reason to believe has led either directly or indirectly to, or at all events has been connected with, the loss of more than one ship in recent years, and it is the latter use of these policies which this Bill is intended to stop.<lb/>
I will give an instance of what I will call the legitimate use of P.P.I. policies. It often happens that a merchant wishes to effect some extra insurance on a cargo while it is in transit. A very frequent cause of this being done is where the market has risen, and where consequently the cargo is more valuable than it was when he took out the policy, and in order that his risk may be fully covered, as the easiest and the readiest and the speediest way of covering that risk, he often takes out one of these P.P.I. policies. That is a perfectly legitimate thing to do, and we have no desire to interfere with it; but, besides that, a practice has arisen of people taking out these policies purely as a speculation. Policies are taken out by people who have no interest whatever in the ship or her cargo, and there are several evils connected with that practice. In the first place, it is very often extremely detrimental to the owner of the ship, because when he wishes, in a perfectly straightforward way, to insure his interest and to
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0625"/>
<col>1243</col>
insure himself against risk, he may find that he has been forestalled by these gamblers, and that either he cannot insure his ship at all, or has to do so at a very exorbitant premium.<lb/>
Then it has been found to be most unfair to the officers of these ships, and that is a point which has been raised before in your Lordships' House by a noble Lord whose interest in these matters is well known, and who I am sorry not to see in his place to-day. It has sometimes happened that when it becomes known that a number of these policies are outstanding on any particular ship the owners think&#x2014;and they have very good reason for thinking&#x2014;that there is a screw loose somewhere, and in consequence more than once an owner has discharged all his officers, and sometimes the crew as well, so as to make his position safe; but, of course, the greatest evil of all which we have to deal with in this matter is that very large sums of money are to be won by the loss of the ship, and we have to bear in mind the consideration that that fact makes it probable that unscrupulous people will adopt measures to secure the loss of the ship. As I have said, there are grave reasons for believing that on more than one occasion in recent years something of that sort has been done, or, at all events, if it has not been done, the least that one can infer from reading the evidence of these cases is that certain people have been in possession of knowledge which showed that there was something wrong with the ship which was likely to cause her loss, and instead of going, as any straightforward person ought to go, with such information to the owners in order to avert possible loss of life, they have kept that information to themselves and have betted upon it, often with very large profit.<lb/>
It is, of course, very difficult to get at the truth in a matter of this kind, but one cannot help being suspicious when one finds, for instance, that a relation of the master profits to the extent of &#x00A3;6,000 by the loss of a ship. That actually happened in one case. One's suspicions are again aroused when one finds a man insuring a ship for &#x00A3;1,000 at a premium of 100 guineas&#x2014;a ship which was lost a short time afterwards. That transaction from a gambling point of view meant that this man accepted a bet of nine to one against the ship going to the bottom on one single voyage. That is, of
<col>1244</col>
course, a totally inadequate rate of odds unless he had very good reason indeed for supposing that it would happen. The man who had that particular speculation gave a rather interesting account to the Court of Inquiry of several other speculations of the same sort which he had had. He seems to have had five in all. One of these he lost, as the ship arrived safely in port. Another bet he lost, if I may use the expression, by a short head, for the ship went to the bottom a very little time after the policy expired. The other three he won, the ship going safely to the bottom in each case. That may have been luck or it may have been judgment, but it is extremely difficult to believe that it was all quite fair and above board.<lb/>
Your Lordships must remember that in dealing with this matter we have not only to protect the interests of the underwriters, who are the victims in the first instance in these cases, but we have also to protect the owners of the ship and cargo, and, what is a great deal more important, we have to protect the lives of the officers and seamen. The Bill itself is a very short one, and I think its provisions are quite simple. There are only three, I think, with which I need trouble the House. First of all it is provided that any person taking out a gambling policy of marine insurance is liable to a penalty of &#x00A3;100 or to imprisonment with or without hard labour for six months, unless he has a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the safe arrival of the ship. The second provision is that any person in the employment of the owner of a ship who takes out such a policy will be liable to a similar punishment whether he has an insurable interest or not. But I may say, in passing, that that provision does not prevent a captain or other officer from insuring his clothes or instruments or other valuables; all that it does is to provide that he must do it in an open and above board way by means of an ordinary insurance policy. The third provision is that any underwriter who knowingly issues a policy in contravention of the Act will be liable to a similar penalty, and, as a safeguard against frivolous prosecution, it is provided that proceedings can only be taken under this Bill with the consent of the Law Officers of the Crown.<lb/>
Before preparing this Bill, my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade consulted every interest concerned. He had conferences with the representatives of the underwriters, with repre-
<image src="S5LV0002P0I0626"/>
<col>1245</col>
Sentatives of the shipowners, and with representatives of the merchant service officers' associations. The result of those conferences is the Bill which is now before the House, which has the approval of all those interests, which has passed through the other House without any opposition whatever, and which I now ask your Lordships to read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03065">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Hamilton of Dalzell.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0002P0-03066"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I look upon this Bill as a useful instalment of the legislation necessary to put marine insurance on a proper footing so as to put a stop, if possible, to over-insurance. To prove that this can only be an instalment I shall call attention to the case of the "Gunford," on which vessel P.P.I. policies were effected to the extent of &#x00A3;6,500. This vessel was valued at &#x00A3;9,000, yet she was insured at &#x00A3;19,000. The value of her freight was about &#x00A3;4,800; half of this had been paid in advance and so was not at risk, yet it was insured for &#x00A3;5,500. The total of her insurances amounted to &#x00A3;35,800, of which &#x00A3;6,500 were P.P.I. policies on the personal account of the managers, Messrs. Briggs. It is therefore clear that the managers stood to win far more than they would lose if the "Gunford" was wrecked. To command this ship they appointed a man of German origin named Sember, whose chief qualification for the appointment appears to have been that he had had his certificate suspended for the loss of the "Perthshire" twenty-two years previously, and that he had not been to sea since. With the help of a tug, Sember brought the "Gunford" as far as Dungeness. Thence he managed to get out of the Channel into the open sea, but in making the South American coast he struck on three different shoals on three different days, making a total loss of his ship on the third shoal. The crew of the "Gunford" consisted of twenty-six men, mostly Germans, ten of whom died of fever shortly after the shipwreck. Some of the underwriters refused to pay their insurances to the owners, who went to law about it. The state of the law and the customs of insurers and underwriters are shown in the judgment of Lord Salvesen in this case, as reported in <i>The Times</i> of July 22 last, and with the permission of
<col>1246</col>
the House I will read a short extract from that judgment. Lord Salvesen said&#x2014;
<quote>"The fact was that the responsibility for over-insurance of ships rested with the underwriter, and not with the shipowner. Underwriters habitually decline to insure vessels at their market value, or, indeed, substantially below the cost price. The reasons for which they adopted this course in their own presumed interest&#x2014;although it would seem to furnish a motive to the ship-owner to be less careful of the safety of the ship&#x2014;were disclosed in the proof. All such policies were free of particular average under three per cent. When the three per cent. was calculated on a small sum&#x2014;say &#x00A3;10,000 &#x2014;all average above &#x00A3;300 had to be paid for by the underwriter, whereas if the same ship was insured on a declared value of &#x00A3;20,000 he escaped all claims below &#x00A3;600. The same principle applied in cases of constructive total loss. Underwriters had, therefore, deliberately adopted the policy of declining to insure vessels at their market value, and they preferred to run the risks of the owners being careless or dishonest, rather than have to meet claims which they would otherwise avoid, or to raise materially the annual premiums."</quote>
Lord Salvesen decided that the insurances were to be paid. Now I am not criticising Lord Salvesen's judgment. I am merely taking his words as evidence of the state of the law and of the customs of insurers and underwriters, many of whom do not appear to take into consideration the case of the merchant seamen who, as third parties, are exposed to a greater risk of shipwrecks by these transactions. In their interests I consider that the law requires further alteration and I hail this P.P.I. Bill as an instalment only. It may pay some owners to over-insure, and it may pay some underwriters to assist them in so doing; but the loss of a ship and cargo must fall on some one; and the world in general must be the poorer whenever a cargo of coal or wheat is lost through over insurance. It is said that bad cases make good law, and I hope that the "Gunford" case will eventually do so.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0002P0-03071"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we propose to take the Committee on the Housing and Town Planning Bill on Tuesday, September 21. We may safely assume, I think, that this stage will take more than one day. Whether it will occupy the whole of the rest of the week we shall be better able to judge when we have started upon it. The Irish Land Bill will, I understand, be through in another place to-morrow. I understand, however,
<col>1248</col>
that it would not meet the convenience of noble Lords from Ireland to attempt to take the Second Reading next week, and we propose, therefore, to put the Second Reading down for Tuesday, September 28, which would enable two days to be given to that stage. The Committee stage of the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Bill will be taken on Monday, September 27, and the Report of the Housing and Town Planning Bill on Thursday, September 30. We should proceed with the Irish Land Bill in Committee on Monday, October 4, and such following days as may be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
